**Chapter 3**

**The Philidor**

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4!**

Introduction

**In this chapter we will study how to:**

- Use your tactical opportunities with the classical Bxf7 sacrifice

- Use your forces to checkmate the king in the center

- Use the weakness of the back rank

- Use your space advantage and the cramped position of your opponent’s pieces

- Use the advantage of the two bishops

Franco is-Andre Danican Philidor was the greatest chess player of his time, even though his formal occupation was not as a chessplayer but a musician. In fact, in the 18th century Philidor was a famous music composer.

At that time, the attacking Italian style of chess was dominant: giving up a pawn or a piece for just one tempo was the usual way a chess game was played. Many encounters were decided in this manner — this was due to the strong tactical and attacking abilities of the players, and also because nobody knew how to defend! Everybody dreamed only about conducting a brilliant attack with sacrifices...

Then along came Philidor, who looked at the “Italian style” and analyzed deeply. He realized that pawns played the most important role in the game of chess:

- Pawns help control the center.

- They storm the bastions of your enemy.

- The pawn structure also dictates your plan in positions where there are many possibilities to choose from.

His well-known motto, “Pawns are the soul of chess” is immortal!

Philidor’s book on chess strategy was published and translated into most major European languages, including Russian. For a hundred years it was the most important chess book, and no significant addition or modification was required! (It was only much later that the positional rules were developed by Steinitz and Capablanca.)

Philidor preached about understanding the relative value of the pieces, the correct pawn formations, and the value of having a strong pawn center. He believed that only with a strong pawn center could one reach an equal or a better position, since the pawns help the pieces to reach better locations.

In this way, based on his own understanding of chess, Philidor solved his opening problems - and the Philidor Defense was born!

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6**

Black develops in accordance to the main principle of Philidor’s strategy: he plans to attack the center with his pawns. By protecting e5, he prepares to break in the center with 3..T5. Even today, Philidor’s Defense is not such a rare guest in Grandmaster practice. Nisipeanu and Bacrot, for example, use this opening line regularly.


**3.d4!**

Attacking the most important point in Black’s position - the e5 pawn. After this critical move, according to today’s theory, White has the upper hand in all variations. In the subsequent games we will cover the theory so that you will know how to gain the advantage with White. Black has many possible replies:

3...Bg4? See B-Alterman - Glassywoman, Internet Chess Club 2003.

3...f5? It is especially important to know how to answer the sharp Philidor Counterattack.

3...Nd7!? See B-Alterman — uturn, Internet Chess Club 2005, and Shredder — Woodpusher, Tel Aviv 2004.

3...Nc6 allows White to transfer the game to the Ruy Lopez after 4.Bb5, when Black is committed to a passive line.

3...exd4 This move is very popular (and is the one most modern-day grandmasters would choose), but it is opposed to the original idea of Philidor’s Defense, as Black surrenders the center instead of keeping his and attacking White’s!

3...Nf6 See Ionov - Yandemirov, Russia (ch) 1994.

If instead of 3.d4! White does not play aggressively, for example with the passive 3.Be2? then after 3...f5! Black would succeed in destroying the key e4-pawn, when White would have to play very carefully just to maintain the balance.

**Game 14**

**B-Alterman — Glassywoman**

Internet Chess Club 2003

**l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 Bg4?**

This move has been well-known to be a mistake since the game Morphy - Consultants, Paris 1858.

**4.dxe5!**

Now Black has to give up his pair of bishops and his only developed piece.

**4...Bxf3**

Instead 4...dxe5 loses a pawn after 5.Qxd8 Kxd8 and there is no longer a pin, thus 6.Nxe5.

**5.Qxf3**

The Czech grandmaster Ludek Pachman recommended 5.gxf3 dxe5 6.Qxd8 Kxd8 7.f4 and this is another good option. White opens the game in order to use the power of his bishops.

**5...dxe5**

Even though Black has managed to maintain material equality, White already has his queen in the game, and with:

**6.Bc4**

White immediately puts his bishops to work in an open position. Coupled with White’s superior development, it is clear that Black faces an uphill battle.

**6...Qd7**

Trying to defend all his weaknesses at the same time. The aforementioned Morphy game continued:

6...Nf6 7.Qb3!

Targeting both the weak spots, f7 and b7; the latter was weakened by the disappearance of Black’s light-squared bishop. In fact, after just seven moves, Black is already lost!


7...Qe7

Defending the more important pawn and also intending to exchange queens with 8...Qb4. Instead 7...b6? leaves f7 unattended and loses instantly: 8.Bxf7 Kd7 9.Qe6# B-Alterman -

Picapiedra, Internet Chess Club 2005. Perhaps not a contender for my best games collection. 7...Qd7? does not help either after 8.Qxb7 Qc6 9.Bb5 and Black’s queen is gone .

8.Nc3

Perhaps because this game was played at an opera house in Paris, and his opponents were not so strong, Morphy decided to follow his own rules and played for development, preventing

the exchange of queens. I guess in a normal tournament game Morphy might have gone for 8.Qxb7 Qb4 9.Qxb4 Bxb4 10.c3 and converted his extra pawn in the endgame.

But even better is 8.Bxf7! diverting Black’s queen from the potential check on b4. 8...Kd8 (or 8...Qxf7 9.Qxb7 wins the rook on a8) 9.Qxb7 Qb4 10.Qxb4 Bxb4 11.c3 White is two pawns up with a better position. For example: 11...Bc5 12.Bg5 Nbd7 13.Nd2 Rf8 14.Be6 h6 15.Bxd7 hxg5 16.Bc6 Rb8 17.Nf3 Rxb2?

***White toplay and win!***

18.O-O-O! This was the end of the game Tenk — Egert, Brno 1930.

Let’s return to Morphy:

8...c6

Taking away d5 from White’s knight.

9Bg5

The most active square for the bishop, pinning Black’s knight.

9...b5?

9...Qc7 was the only defensive try.

10.Nxb5!

In accordance with one of Steinitz’s principles — when holding the advantage, one must attack or else risk losing the advantage.

White has no time for the timid 10.Be2? Qb4! and Black escapes with the trade of queens.

10...cxb5 11.Bxb5 Nbd7

White’s bishops exert a crippling effect on the pinned enemy pieces. Not only are Black’s knights immobilized, his remaining pieces are also unable to develop.

Of course 11...Kd8 was no improvement due to 12.O-O-O.

12.O-O-O

Connecting the rooks to bring more forces to bear upon d7. White’s simple aim is to have more attackers than there are defenders, which would allow the capture of the pinned piece.

12...Rd8


13.Rxd7! Rxd7 14.Rdl

Nimzowitsch called this maneuver an “exchanging combination on the pinning square”.

This is what he had to say regarding this matter in *My System-.*

“Before 13.Rxd7, White had two attackers against two real defenders because the f6-knight is half dead and the queen is too important a piece to do well in a rough-and-tumble involving minor pieces. After 13.Rxd7, White loses an attacking piece, but immediately after that he replaces it with a fresh rook, whereas Black’s defensive rook on d8 is irretrievably lost. So White has gained a fighting unit and secured the superiority of numbers in the struggle against the pinned piece.”

14...Qe6

Desperation. Black hoped to salvage something in the endgame despite being two pawns down:

15.Bxd7

Also possible was 15.Qxe6 fxe6 16.Bxf6 followed by capturing the rook, but instead Morphy came up with a brilliant combination.

15...Nxd7

Black’s knight is still pinned due to the danger of Rd8 mate.


***White to play! - How should he continue?***

16.Qb8!!

Forcibly removing the knight, and mate follows:

16...Nxb8 17.Rd8#

This famous game is Morphy - Consultants, Paris 1858. The Consultants, the Duke of Brunswick and Count Isouard, did not play especially well, but Morphy put them away in style.

After this immortal game, nobody used 3...Bg4? in serious competition anymore, even though later analysis showed that Black could have improved with:

6...Qf6

It is unappetizing to go for a position where you do not have counterplay, and your opponent has the two bishops and the clearly better prospects.


For example:

7.Qb3

Avoiding the exchange of queens and putting pressure on b7.

7...Bc5

Counterattacking £2.

8.O-O Bb6 9.a4

Aiming to dislodge the bishop with a4-a5, renewing the threat to b7.

9...a5 10.Nc3 Ne7 11Be3

A typical move (for either side) in the Open Games. The queens bishop, having no useful outpost, is considerably less active than the king’s bishop, which puts pressure on £2 (or f7 for White). Thus, players aim to get rid of their weaker bishop, not fearing the doubled pawns after ...Bxe3 (or Bxe6) since it would open the f-file for the rook.

11...O-O

After 11...Nd7 12.Rad1 White keeps a serious advantage.

12.Rad1

First taking control of the open file...

12...Na6

12...Bxe3? is still bad: 13.fxe3 Qg6 Now White utilizes the open d- and f-files, and the weakness of the back rank, with 14.Bxf7! Qxf7 15.Qxf7 Rxf7 16.Rd8 Rf8 17.Rdxf8#.

13.Bxb6 cxb6 14.Bxa6 bxa6

...and after a series of exchanges the rook can invade the 7th rank:

15.Rd7!

White has a clear advantage, Bernard - Bloemink, Varna 1972.

**7.Nc3**

Continuing with development a la Morphy.

**7...c6 8.Bg5 a5?**

Unable to find a satisfactory way of mobilizing his forces, Black continues moving only his pawns, allowing White to display the power of his better development.

8..T6 was the best try to prevent White’s main threat, but even then after 9.Be3 Bd6 10.O-O-O Qc7 1 l.Qh3! Black is helpless to stop 12.Qe6.

**9.Rd1**

The rook takes control of the only open file.

**9...Qc7**

What should White play? White has strong pressure on f7, and his rook is itching to invade on d8. Blacks queen is overloaded trying to defend both weaknesses, and so, by decoying the queen from her defense of one of these key squares, White manages to breakthrough:


**10.Qxf7!**

Or 10.Rd8! Qxd8 11.Qxf7#.

**10...Qxf7 11.Rd8# 1-0**

**What we have learned:**

- Open the position when you have two bishops

- Methods of utilizing a pin: 10.Nxb5! in Morphy’s game

- The power of a preponderance of forces

- An exchanging combination on a pinning square

- The mating pattern Bg5 and Rd8

- The benefits of Be3 (or ...Be6) in the Open Games

- A rook has to take control of an open file before invading on the 7th or 8th rank

**The Philidor Counterattack**

We continue our coverage by looking at Philidor’s original recipe: after 2...d6 attack the center with 3...f5.

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4!**

Aiming at f7 with 3.Bc4 only works if Black plays a dubious reply:

a) 3...h6?

Preventing White from playing Ng5, but this move is just a waste of time and permits White to reach a better position.

4.Nc3

White simply continues developing. Now if Black tries to pin the knight after:

4...Bg4?

White clearly has the upper hand, but his next blow is certainly unusual.


***White has a crushing ‘Legal-style’ combination. Can you find it?***

5.Nxe5!!

White sacrifices his queen! But the offer should not be accepted. White takes aim at the weakest spot in the Blacks position — the f7 pawn. Also, Blacks bishop is hanging on g4, so he has a sad choice.

5...Bxd1

Better is 5...dxe5 but after 6.Qxg4 White gains a pawn and is clearly better.

6.Bxf7 Ke7 7.Nd5#


A fantastic mating construction!

Instead of the helpful 4...Bg4?, better is 4...Nc6. Then a possible line runs: 5.d4 Bg4 6.dxe5 Nxe5?? More-sensible was 6...dxe5, this is losing to a similar combination to the one above...

7.Nxe5! Bxd1 8.Bxf7 The king is left with only one move. 8...Ke7 White ends the debate with 9.Nd5#.

b) All these combinational motifs only worked because of Black’s wasteful 3...h6?. If Black discovered the strongest reply: 3...Be6! This would destroy White’s aggressive plans. After the bishop trade: 4.Bxe6 fxe6 5.d4 exd4 6.Nxd4 Qd7 Black is fine, with a good pawn formation in the center.

**3...f5?**

This was Philidor’s idea. Unfortunately this attempt to wipe out White’s center runs foul of the critical move:


**4.Bc4!**

White immediately takes aim at the weakened a2-g8 diagonal, and already threatens 5.Ng5.

4 .exf5 is weak after 4...e4! and Black is OK. 5.Ng5 Bxf5 6.Bc4 d5 Black closes the diagonal, then plays ...h7-h6 and ...Nf6. White has no advantage.

However 4.dxe5! fxe4 5.Ng5 d5 6.e6 also leads to an advantage.

**4....fxe4**

Just for a moment Black’s position looks OK, but now comes a thematic blow:

**5 .Nxe5!**

This sacrifice helps White keep the initiative, clearing the diagonal for the queen to reach h5 where it can harass the enemy king. Note that there was no time for 5.Ng5? d5.

After the text move Black faces a tough choice - should he accept the knight sacrifice?

**5... dxe5**

Let’s see what happens if Black declines:

5... d5

Black tries to prevent an invasion on f7 and shuts out the c4-bishop, but disaster strikes from the other side of the board.

6 .Qh5

The queen lands on an ideal attacking spot.

6... g6 7.Nxg6!

Thanks to the fact that the h7-pawn is pinned, White blows up the kingside.

7...Nf6

Black’s counterattack is unsuccessful, because of his undeveloped pieces and lack of control of the center.

Of course Black cannot capture the knight: 7...hxg6 8.Qxh8 is winning.

8 .Qe5 Be7


9.Bb5!

9 .Nxh8 allows Black to escape dry from the storm after 9...dxc4, when the knighr is trapped on h8, and Black plans the counterattacking ...Nc6.

The immediate 9.Qxe7 Qxe7 10.Nxe7 leads to an endgame with an extra pawn, but White wants more,

9...c6

This takes away the c6-square from Blacks knight, and so only now does White initiate exchanges:

10 .Nxe7 Qxe7 11.Qxe7 Kxe7 12.Be2

Black is a pawn down without any compensation.

So declining the sacrifice is no good, but after accepting it the black king will be drowned in the deep end.

**6.Qh5 Kd7**

There is no good alternative as 6...Ke7 leads to an immediate loss after 7.Qxe5 Kd7 8.Qe6# and 6...g6 7.Qxe5 picks up the hanging rook on h8.

**7.Qf5!**

It is important to draw the king out to c6, where it will be even more vulnerable to attack.

**7...Kc6 8.Qxe5**

The rest is very instructive. Black has no way of opposing White’s threats.


**8...a6**

Trying to make an escape square for the king. Moving the other pawn does not work: 8...b6 9.Qxe4 Kd6 10.Bf4 Kd7 11.Qe6#. Also hopeless is 8...Nf6 9.Qb5 Kd6 10.Bf4 Ke7 11.Qe5 Be6 12.Qxe6#.

**9.d5 Kb6**

Wandering up the board would not be a good idea: 9...Kc5 10.Be3 Kxc4 (or 10...Kb4 11.Qc3 Ka4 12.b3#) 11.Qxe4 Kb5 12.Nc3 Ka5 13.Qa4#

**10.Be3**

The game has entered its final phase. Black’s king is under heavy fire from Whites artillery.

**10...Bc5**

Once again the king walk would not end well: 10...Ka5 11.a3! (threatening 12.b4 and mate!)

10...c5 1 l.dxc6 Kxc6 12.Nc3 (less accurate is 12.Qxe4 Kc7 13.Bf4 Bd6) 12...Nf6 13.Bb5 axb5 14.Qxb5 Kd6 15.O-O-O Ke7 16.Bc5

**11.Bxc5**

Everything is forced. Black has no time to bring his queenside pieces into the game, thanks to all the trouble his king is in. White is willing to sacrifice plenty of material to keep the attack going.

**11...Kxc5**


**12.b4!**

Now it’s time for White’s pawns to play their part in the kill.

**12...Kxc4**

The other way out is: 12...Kxb4 13.Nd2 Qf6 14.Rb1 Kc5 (or 14...Ka5 15.Qxc7 b6 16.Be2, clearing c4 for the knight, and mate is coming) 15.Qxc7 Nc6 16.Qb6 Kd6 17.Nxe4 White wins the queen.

**13.Qxe4 Kb5 14.a4**

Mate is inevitable.

**14...Kb6 15.Qd4 c5 16.Qxc5# 1-0**

A picturesque sight! White sacrificed his minor pieces to enable his pawns to weave a mating net around the enemy king! These lines show that the old move 3..T5 is not playable. I recommend that the reader studies these variations carefully, because White must play accurately after sacrificing the piece.

**Philidor - Hanham Variation overview**

Apart from exploiting the weakness of f7 (as in all the Open Games), another combinational motif characteristic of the Hanham variation is the cramped position of Black’s pieces, caused by the moves 2...d6 and 3...Nd7. This can be seen most clearly in the traps awaiting Black.

**Game 15 B-Alterman - uturn** Internet Chess Club 2005

**l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 Nd7**

This is the Hanham Variation, named after the American player James Moore Hanham. By maintaining his e5-strongpoint, Black prepares to complete his development with ...Be7 and ...Ngf6. Then, with his solid pawn structure, he hopes for a bright future.


**4.Bc4!**

From now on Black has to defend very carefully. White’s pieces are actively posted and the c4-bishop eyes the traditional weak square on f7. In this popular position Black has a few continuations. The main choices are: **a) 4...h6, b) 4...Ngf6, c) 4...Be7** and **d) 4...c6.**

**a) 4...h6?**

This looks like a loss of tempo. Black is preventing any funny business with Ng5, but instead runs into other serious problems. By the way, this move was analyzed by Jose Raul Capablanca in his well known *Chess Fundamentals,* but Capablanca missed White’s best line, which we will look at now:

**5.dxe5!**

Opening the position to make use of White’s superior development.

**5...dxe5**

Weaker is 5...Nxe5? 6.Nxe5 dxe5. At the moment Black’s king covers both his weaknesses: the attack on f7 and his queen on d8. This tells us the king is overloaded, and the bishop, imbued

with courage, runs into the thick of the action: 7.Bxf7! Winning a pawn, since the bishop is taboo because taking it would distract the king from defending the queen.

After the text move, at first glance it is not so clear how to take advantage of the time-wasting 4...h6. But when we carefully look at the various tactical options, we can see the weakness of the h5-e8 diagonal and that the black queen is protected only by the king. Combining these nuances, White comes up with a nice tactical shot:


**6.Bxf7!!**

White unexpectedly cracks open Black’s kingside.

**6...Kxf7 7.Nxe5**

The point of the combination! Black cannot capture the knight due to the hanging queen on d8.

**7...Ke8?**

This move loses on the spot. We shall return to this position later.

**8.Qh5**

This game demonstrates the downsides of 4...h6. Due to the weakening of the critical diagonal h5-e8, Black’s king falls into a mating net.

**8...Ke7 9.Ng6**

9 .Qf7! would be more precise: 9...Kd6 10.Nc4 Kc5 11.Qd5 Kb4 12.a3 Ka4 13.b3#

**9...Kf6**

Or 9...Ke6 10.Qf5 Kd6 11.Qd5#.

**10.Nxh8**

10 .Qf5# was more to the point!

**10... Ne5 11.Bf4 Bd6 12.Bxe5 Bxe5 13.Qf7 Kg5 14.h4 Kg4 15.Qf3# 1-0**

Let’s go back and consider defenses other than 7...Ke8. 7...Ke7? is also losing to 8.Ng6, so the best defense is:

7...Kf6!

And now White has a wide choice, but the strongest is:

8.Nc3!!

White switches from “checking mode” to calm development! After this brilliant move Black’s position can no longer be saved. Black must accept the sacrifice of the second piece, when his king gets only a one-way ticket.

It was possible to go wrong with 8.Qd4? when after 8...c5! 9.Nxd7 Ke7 the black king would run away from the worst of the danger.


8... Kxe5

Fighting to the bitter end.

Instead 8...Bb4 is strongly met by 9.Qd4! when the black king is in a mating net. 9...Bxc3 10.bxc3 Ke6 11.Qd5 KfiS 12.Qf7! Bang! Black has to accept the knight, which allows White to develop the bishop with an important tempo and mate becomes inevitable. 12...Kxe5 13.Bf4 Kxe4 14.f3 mate!

After the text move the following line is pretty forced: White is going to draw Black’s king to the queenside, where he will meet his death.

9 .Qd5 Kf6 10.Qf5 Ke7 11.Nd5

The knight comes very strongly into play.

11...Kd6

Black could end it all at once with 11...Ke8 12.Qg6#.

12.Bf4

Now it’s time for the bishop to get involved; White has three pieces attacking Black’s lone king.

12...Kc6 13.Qe6! Bd6

This is the critical position.


***White to play! - How should he continue the attack?***

14.Nb4!!

Only this nice move fuels the fire of White’s attack. The black king will be attacked (briefly!) by all Whites forces.

14... Kb6

The alternatives do not help:

14...Kc5 15.a4! Ngf6 16.Be3 Kxb4 17.Qb3 Ka5 18.Qb5#

14...Kb5 15.a4! Ka5 16.Qc4 c6 17.Nd5 and mate is coming.

15.Bxd6

Getting rid of the only defender.

15...cxd6 16.Qxd6 Ka5

The end is near. Sometimes during an attack, after many checks in a row, you reach a moment when only a “quiet” piece improvement will finish the attack successfully. In the current position White has to regroup his forces and control the rest of the squares around the black king. The next move solves the task.

17.Nd5! b6 18.c4

Whites pawns advance, leaving Black with fewer and fewer options.

18...Ka6 19.Qc6

The trap is closed! There will be no escape.


19.. .Ngf6 20.Nb4 Ka5 21.Qb5#

In spite of the fact that all these variations are not easy to remember, I would ask you to study the ideas in this section very carefully. White is doing well, but his early sacrifices mean that he is committed to getting it right, as otherwise the material deficit will tell.

The line we have just examined shows once again that to use his positional advantage White has to attack according to Steinitz’ positional principle which we studied in the Danish gambit chapter.

The next two variations show the importance of having control of the center, since Black finds himself in trouble after just four moves...

**b) 4...Ngf6?**

This natural developing move allows Whites knight to reach g5 easily, piling the pressure on f7.

**5.dxe5!**

The attack on f7 gains in strength after this capture.

**5...Nxe5**

This is Black’s best chance, as the alternatives fail in a hurry:

5... Nxe4? loses to the double attack 6.Qd5.

Also weak is 5...dxe5 as after 6.Ng5 Black has no way to defend f7. For example: 6...Qe7 7.Bxf7

Kd8 8.Ne6

**6.Nxe5 dxe5**


***What would you play as White?***

**7.Bxf7!**

White picks up the pawn with check, converting his positional advantage into a material one. And not 7.Qxd8 Kxd8 8.Bxf7 when Black regains the pawn after 8...Nxe4.

After the text move it looks as if the bishop cannot be taken due to the loose queen on d8, but...

7...Kxf7

Anyway!

**8.Qxd8 Bb4**

The only chance, uncovering a discovered attack on the queen with check.

**9.Qd2**

White has to return the queen for the bishop.

**9...Bxd2 10.Nxd2**

After a very sharp battle with attacks and counterattacks, with sacrifices and counter sacrifices, we have reached a calmer position, where White has gained a pawn and Blacks e5-pawn is isolated and weak. White has a huge advantage, and he can continue with b2-b3, Bb2, f2-f3 and Nc4, to exploit the weakness of e5.

**c) 4...Be7?**

Another natural move, preventing Ng5 and preparing ...Ngf6 followed by castling. But look at what happens:


**5.dxe5!**

It is important to open the d-file for White’s queen.

**5...Nxe5**

Even worse is 5...dxe5?? due to 6.Qd5!. It is hard to believe, but Black loses a piece after just five moves! 6...Nh6 7.Bxh6 And f7 is still undefended. This nice variation once again emphasizes the importance of controlling the center.

**6.Nxe5 dxe5**

Blacks queen is defended by the bishop and so Bxf7 will not have the same effect as before, but the exchanges on e5 have created a weakness there which White can exploit:

7.Qh5!

Forking the f7- and e5-pawns.

**7...g6 8.Qxe5**

White is simply a pawn up.

We have reached Blacks best option: **d) 4...c6!**


Showing no fear of the formidable bishop at c4, Black calmly completes his main idea - to take control of the most important center squares with his pawns. As a result, Black is planning to continue with his development - 5...Be7 6.dxe5 dxe5 - since the killer 7.Qd5 is no longer possible. Moreover, the aggressive thrust of the knight:

**5.Ng5**

Can be calmly met by:

**5...Nh6 6.a4**

A common pawn move in the Philidor Defense, preventing Black from expanding on the queenside with ...b7-b5. Incidentally, White also sets a hidden trap.

The usual move is 6.O-O. This is also venomous, as after the developing 6...Be7?. (Black once again falls into a trap. Correct is to first ease the congestion by 6...Nb6!.) 7.Ne6!! Opening the h5-e8 diagonal that leads right to Blacks king. 7...fxe6 8.Bxh6


Removing the last defender of f7. Now Black has three options:

8...gxh6?? loses on the spot to 9.Qh5 Kf8 10.Bxe6 and Black is helpless against the dual threats of 11.Qf7 and 11.Qxh6 mate!.

8...Bf6 9.Bxe6 Qe7 10.Bxd7 Bxd7 1 l.Be3 And Black has no compensation for the pawn.

The best try is 8...Nb6, defending e6 while attacking White’s bishops. 9.Bxg7 Nxc4 (or 9...Rg8 10.Qh5 Kd7 11.Bxe6! Kc7 (11...Kxe6 12.Qf5#) 12.Bxg8 and wins) 10.Bxh8 Kf7 Trying to get two bishops for the rook. 11.b3 Nb6 12.f4 Qxh8 13.Qh5 White has a strong attack (Kmoch).

**6...Be7??**

This “plausible” developing move actually cramps Blacks queen.

Correct is 6...exd4! 7.Qxd4 Ne5! and Black rebuffs White’s aggressive intentions.

Also possible is to use the free f6-square with 6...Qf6 when the queen escapes from her cramped position and also prepares for possible kingside operations. For example, the game Leonhardt - Nimzowitsch, Hamburg 1911, continued 7.c3 Be7 8.O-O Nb6 9.Ba2 Qg6.

**7.Bxf7!!**

Creating an entry point for the knight on e6.

**7...Nxf7 8.Ne6 Qb6**

8...Qa5 loses in similar fashion: 9.Bd2 Qb6 10.a5 Qxb2 11**.Bc3** Qb5 and now 12.Nc7.

**9.a5! Qb4 10.c3 Qc4 11.Nc7 Kd8 12.b3**

And the queen has no escape squares!

**1-0**

**Game 16 Shredder - Woodpusher** Tel Aviv 2004

You probably would not be able to find the following game in any database, since it was played in the Computer World Championship in 2004 where I assisted the Deep Junior program and commented on the games. This particular encounter surprised me not by the result, but by the inevitable and neat realization of Whites positional advantage. Even now, using the latest software, I am unable to find any serious improvement of Whites powerful and precise play, which is a model for playing against the Hanham Defense.

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 Nd7 4.Bc4 c6**

As explained previously, only this move retains Black’s position in the center.

**5.O-O**

The main move and also the strongest.

**5...Be7**

Preventing Ng5.

**6.dxe5!?**

As we have observed so many times before, this intermediate exchange of pawns is a strong prelude to the tactical exploitation of the weakness of f7.

Instead, after the standard developing moves 6.Nc3 NgfiS, White plays 7.a4. An important move, preventing Black’s queenside expansion starting with ...b5, which is standard in the Philidor Defense.


7...O-O Black has a solid, but slightly passive position. Still, this type of position has been employed by some top grandmasters with Black, such as for example the Ukrainian GM Eljanov.

**6...dxe5**

6... Nxe5? With less space, Black tries to exchange pieces, but this is tactically flawed: 7.Nxe5 dxe5 and White uses the cleared d1-h5 diagonal to spring a double attack 8.Qh5! winning a pawn: 8...g6 9.Qxe5 Black has no compensation for the lost material.

**7.Ng5!**

Thanks to this tactical resource, White wins the long-term advantage of the bishop pair.

White would not achieve anything special with other moves:

1\) 7.c3 Ngf6 8.Bxf7? And this sacrifice fails after 8...Kxf7 9.Qb3 Ke8 10.Ng5 Rf8 11.Ne6 Nc5!

2\) 7.Nc3

This slow development allows Black to achieve counterplay on the queenside.

7. ..NgfiS 8.Bg5 O-O 9.Qe2 Qc7 10.Rad1 Nc5 11.h3?

Better is 11.a4!.

11...b5!

This is one of Black’s main intentions in the Philidor Defense, grabbing more space on the queenside. Suddenly, White’s pieces lose their coordination.

12.Bb3 a5 13.a3? b4 14.axb4 axb4 15.Nb1 Nxb3 16.cxb3 Ba6

White resigns, AndreLundin — B-Alterman, Internet Chess Club 2004.

3\) 7.Qe2!?

This tricky move was recommended by Bobby Fischer so it deserves to be mentioned. Here we have 3a) and 3b) 7...h6!.

7...b5 is less attractive: 8.Bb3 a6 9.Rd1 Qc7 10.Ng5 Nh6 11.a4! Keeping the tension. 11...Nc5 12.axb5 White wins the fight for the d5-outpost. 12...Nxb3 13.cxb3 cxb5 14,Nc3 White was better in Karalkin - Pogosjan, St Petersburg 1998.

3a) 7...Ngf6 8.Rd1

Now there is a split between 3a1) 8...Qc7 and 3a2) 8...b5:

3a1) 8...Qc7 9.Ng5 Now Black would be in trouble after 9...O-O?:


10.Bxf7! And Black resigned in the famous friendly game Fischer - Fine, New York 1963. The problem is that after 10...Rxf7 1 l.Qc4 Black cannot save his rook.

3a2) 8...b5 9.Bb3! (White could continue in gambit style with 9.Nxe5!? bxc4 10.Nxc6 Qc7 11.Nxe7 Kxe7 12.Nc3 with two pawns and a strong initiative for the sacrificed piece) 9...Qb6 10.a4 With the better game.

3b) 7...h6!

Only this move solves the problem. Black stops Ng5 forever and White can hardly use the extra tempo because of the closed nature of the position.

8.Rd1 Qc7 9.a4 Nf8

Also possible is 9...Ngf6 and Black is ready to castle.

10.b3 Ng6 11.Bb2 Nf6 12.Nbd2 O-O

Black’s position even looked slightly better in Kleiman - Panchanathan, Philadelphia 2006.


**7...Bxg5**

Once again defending with the knight is not enough:

7...Nh6?!

Black is hit by the same tactical shot:

8.Ne6! fxe6 9.Bxh6 Nb6

The alternatives are even less inspiring:

9...Bf6 10.Qh5 g6 1 l.Qg4 Nc5 12.b4! Black is almost lost.

9...O-O 10.Qg4Bf6 1 l.Bxe6 Kh8 12.Be3 White was simplyapawn up in Akopian - Radulov, Cannes 1993.

10.Qh5 Kf8

Or 10...g6 11.Qe2 Nxc4 12,Qxc4 and Black avoids immediate defeat, but will suffer from doubled pawns and a passive light-squared bishop.

11.f4!

Whites attack is difficult to stop.

**8.Qh5 Qe7 9.Qxg5**

9.Bxg5 Ngf6 10.Qe2± is another good option.

**9...Qxg5 10.Bxg5 Ngf6**

A game between two top grandmasters took a different course:

10...Nc5 11.f3 Be6

Also trying to get rid of the bishop pair, but not getting the doubled pawns.

12.Be2 Nf6 13.Nd2 Nfd7 14.b3!

This keeps Black under more tension. Anand — Ivanchuk, Monte Carlo 1996, continued 14.Nc4 f6 15.Be3 Bxc4 16.Bxc4 Ke7 and, due to the bishop pair, White was better.

14..T6 15.Be3 Kf7 16.a4 a5 17.Rfdl

White keeps a pleasant advantage, for instance:

17...Rhd8 18.Bc4! b6 19.Bxe6 Nxe6 20.Nc4

Black is struggling to defend his queenside.

**11.f3 Nb6**

11...Nf8 would not change much after 12.Nd2 Ne6 13.Be3 with a clear edge for White in Givon - Yaacov, Herzliya 2008.

**12.Bb3 O-O?!**

It was probably not the best idea to remove the king from the center.

12...Be6 could be tried since after 13.Bxe6 fxe6 14.b3 the black king is closer to his weak pawns than if he had castled.

But stronger is 13.Nd2! forcing Black to decide where to move his king. If he castles, then as in the game, White will capture on e6; if Black does not castle, he has to capture on b3. 13...Bxb3 14.axb3! Gaining the open a-file. 14...Nfd7 15.Rfd1 With a clear advantage on the queenside, Hagesaether — Trevelyan, Telford 2005.

**13.a4!**

White gains more space on the queenside, before moving to take full control over the d-file.


**13...Be6**

Black decides to get rid of one of White’s powerful bishops at any cost, but the resulting weakness in his pawn structure will paralyze his own pieces.

**14.Bxe6 fxe6 15.Nd2**

From here the knight hopes to go to c4, taking aim at Blacks weaknesses on d6 and e5, while instead on c3 the knight would lack good prospects.

**15...a5**

Necessary, otherwise after a4-a5 Whites knight would become too active on c4.

**16.Be3**

Repositioning the bishop to a more useful diagonal where it targets the newly-created weakness along the g1-a7 diagonal.

**16...Rfd8 17.Rfd1 Nfd7**

Black will not allow the white knight to reach c4.


**18.b3!**

Having mobilized all its forces, Shredder starts to methodically improve its position, safe in the knowledge that Black will not be able to hold his position together with so many weaknesses. First, a4 is defended and Blacks knight is deprived of the c4-square.

**18...Re8**

The b6-knight cannot move, since that would allow White’s knight to reach c4.

**19.Nf1! Re7**

Black’s knights are crippled, and his rooks have no targets of attack.

**20.Rd3**

Naturally doubling rooks and seizing the only open file.

**20...Rf8 21.Rad1 Ref7 22.c4**

The pieces have done their job; now the pawns too will have a role to play. The threat is c4-c5, winning a piece.

**22...c5 23.Rd6!**

The weak spot on d6 (the move 4...c6 is to blame!) has been captured, and the decisive invasion has begun! Blacks material losses are just a matter of time.

**23...Re8**

How should White press home his positional advantage?

**24.Bf2!!**

A dual-purpose move: the only inactive piece, the knight, will begin a long trip from f1-e3-c2- a3-b5-c7, and the bishop now has the options of attacking from el, f2, g3 or h4.

**24...Ree7 25.Bh4!**

Shredder is focused till the end! Instead, after the impatient 25.Be1 Nc8! and 26...b6, Black is still alive.

**25...Re8 26.Ne3 h5**

Preventing Ng4 and Bg3, but the white knight treads along its intended path:


**27.Nc2**

It is clear that Black’s pawns will drop like fresh apples. Black’s moves in the rest of the game are rather silly-looking, but they show that even a strong computer is unable to find any way to save the game, or even make it look close...

**27...Ra8 28.Rxe6**

One down...

**28...Rf4 29.Bg5 2f7 30.Ne3 Raf8 31.Nf5 Rb8 32.Ne7 Kh7 33.Ng6 Na8 34.Nxe5**

Two down...

**34...Nxe5 35.Rxe5 b6 36.Bd8 g6 37.Re6 R£b7**


**38.e5**

...and the passed pawn starts the victory march.

**38...Rf7 39.Rc6 Rg7 40.e6 g5 41.e7 1-0**

After playing through this game again and again, it is reminiscent of the brilliant positional technique of Akiba Rubinstein and Anatoly Karpov.

**What we have learned:**

- White uses the weakness of the f7-pawn in many situations.

- The bishop pair in an open position is a potent force which is unpleasant to deal with.

- Controlling the only open central file could bring many dividends.

**Game 17 B-Alterman — Peacenick** Internet Chess Club 2006

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 exd4**

Obviously 3...exd4 is an act of positional capitulation from Black. White gains a clear space advantage after either 4.Nxd4 or 4.Qxd4. However White has to play carefully to gain an opening advantage.

**4.Nxd4**

Also reasonable is 4.Qxd4. White develops his queen and is ready to meet 4...Nc6 with 5.Bb5 Bd7 6.Bxc6 giving up the two bishops, but after the further 6...Bxc6 7.Nc3 Nf6 we reach a critical position. White has to choose between 1) 8.O-O and 2) 8.Bg5.

1\) 8.O-O

This move keeps only a slight edge for White, but it became famous due to a fancy combination that occurred in the game E.Z. Adams — C. Torre, New Orleans 1920. Some have questioned whether this was a real game or whether it was composed. We shall leave that debate to the historians and instead enjoy the moves:

8...Be7 9.Nd5 Bxd5 10.exd5

White retains a long-term advantage due to his extra space, and it is not so easy for Black to get rid of White’s pressure. The plan is Re1 and Bg5 then double rooks on the e-file; Black can only defend.

10...O-O 11.Bg5 c6 12.c4

Also possible is 12.dxc6 bxc6 13.c4 with the usual edge.

12...cxd5

Later analysis showed that the typical combination 12...Nxd5 does not solve Blacks problems: 13.cxd5 Bxg5 14.Nxg5 Qxg5 15.dxc6 bxc6 16.Qxd6 It would not be easy for Black to make a draw.

13.cxd5 Re8 14.Rfe1 a5?!

It was essential to get rid of the pin with 14...h6 15.Bh4 Qb6! and Black is close to equality.

15.Re2!

Whites best chance is to create pressure on the e-file.


15...Rc8 16.Rael

Please note how White improves his position step by step.

16.. .Qd7

Now the combination starts. The motif is the weakness of Blacks back rank.

17.Bxf6 Bxf6

Instead 17...gxf6 would not help after 18.Qf4 planning Nh4-f5 with a decisive advantage.

White to move! How can he use the weakness of Black’s back rank?


18.Qg4! Qb5

Black’s queen is overloaded.

18... Qxg4 19.Rxe8 Rxe8 20.Rxe8#

18... Rxe2 19.Qxd7

19.Qc4!!

Not 19.Rxe8? Rxe8 and the position is quite drawish.

Even worse was the blunder 19.a4?? as after 19...Qxe2! 20.Rxe2 Rc1 21.Ne1 Rxe1 22.Rxe1

Rxe1# the wrong king is mated!

19... Qd7

Black has no choice, as 19...Rxc4 20.Rxe8 and 19...Qxc4 20.Rxe8 demonstrate.

20.Qc7!!

Once again using the same motif.

20...Qb5 21.a4!

The point of the combination; White draws the black queen onto the 4th rank.

Of course not 21.Qxb7? allowing 21...Qxe2!-+.

21...Qxa4 22.Re4!!

The rook leaves the exposed e2-square, and now Black is doomed.

22...Qb5

The alternatives 22...Rxc7 23.Rxe8 and 22...Rxe4 23.Qxc8 hammer home the back rank theme.

23.Qxb7!

The final shot. Black resigned (allegedly) due to 23...Qxb7 24.Rxe8 Rxe8 25.Rxe8#.

1-0

2\) 8.Bg5 Be7 9.O-O-O O-O 10.Rhe1 White gains a strong grip on the center. Despite Black’s two bishops, there is no clear way for him to get rid of White’s space advantage. White plans a kingside attack with h2-h3 and g2-g4. A good move in the near future would be the prophylactic Kb1 to avoid any checks along the c1-h6 diagonal.

**4...Nf6 5.Nc3 Be7**

The most natural way.

Against the old fianchetto plan 5...g6, White simply plays a la Fischer: 6.Be3 Bg7 7.Qd2 O-O 8.O-O-O! Re8 9.f3 Keeping the better game. Thanks to White’s easy piece development and space advantage, Black can hardly organize effective counterplay.

9...a6 10.h4 b5 11.Bg5 (Or the immediate 11.h5!? Nxh5 12.g4 Ng3 13.Rh3 Nxf1 14.Rxf1 c5 15.Nb3 b4 16.Nd5 Nd7 17.Bh6 Bh8 18.Rfh1 with enormous compensation, Acs - Biro, Budapest 1998.) 11...Bb7 12.h5 Nbd7 13.hxg6 White has unpleasant threats on the kingside.

Of course White has various other possibilities, but we shall concentrate on 6.g3 and see what it can teach us. White intends to seize control of the e4- and d5-squares, avoiding the ...d6-d5 break. The bishop will also be useful on g2 to protect its king, especially later when Whites kingside pawns roll up the board, pushing Blacks minor pieces into passivity.

**6...O-O**

At GM level the critical move is considered to be 6...d5, getting in the break before White clamps down on it. A complete theoretical survey is not my intention, so I shall just give a few pointers. 7.e5 Ng4 (After 7...Ne4 8.Nxe4 dxe4 Blacks e-pawn looks weaker than White’s. Then an interesting tactical option is 9.e6!?, for example 9...fxe6 10.Bc4 and Black’s extra pawn will not last.) 8.Bg2 White does not need to defend his pawn. 8...Nxe5 (or 8...O-O 9.f4 c5 10.Nde2 d4 11.Nd5 and White was better in Anand — Morovic Fernandez, Santiago [rapid] 2009) 9.Qe2! There is no rush to regain the pawn. 9...Nec6 (after 9...Nbc6 10.Nxc6 Nxc6 11.Nxd5 White has a pleasant initiative) 10.Be3 White calmly develops and secures an edge. Black’s extra pawn is sure to drop off in the next couple of moves, when White will be forcing the pace in a symmetrical position. Win some, draw some...

**7.Bg2 Bg4**

The standard alternative is:

7...Bd7 8.h3 A necessary prelude to a kingside expansion starting with g3-g4, and also to disallow ...Ng4. 8...Nc6 9.Nde2 Avoiding exchanges as White has more space, and also because this knight can be aggressively reposted on the kingside after g3-g4 and Ng3. 9...Re8 10.O-O Bf8 11.g4! This leads to a clear positional advantage for White. 11...Nb4 12.Ng3 Bc6 Black managed to free d7 for his f6-knight, but after: 13.a3 Na6 14.b4!


Black is cramped. White’s domination was soon decisive in Gelfand - Beim, Odessa 2008.

**8.f3 Bh5?!**

Now the bishop gets stranded on the kingside. Better is 8...Bd7 with play similar to Gelfand - Beim above.

**9.O-O Nbd7 10.Nf3 Re8 11.Be3**

Continuing development. The opening has concluded in White’s favor: he has more space, controls 75% of the center (d5, d4, e4), and has a strongly posted knight on f5. Blacks minor pieces lack outposts and his light-squared bishop is misplaced. It is clear that Black still has a long way to go to solve his problems.

**11...Bf8 12.g4**

Grabbing even more space.

**12...Bg6 13.Ng3**

Avoiding exchanges since White has more space. The misplaced g6-bishop also faces the prospect of f4-f5.


**13...Ne5 14.Qe2**

Preventing ...Nc4 ideas and connecting the rooks.

**14.. .c6 15.Rad1**

White simply centralizes his forces, but 15.g5 Nh5 16.f4 was also very strong.

**15...Qc7 16.Kh1 Nfd7??**

With a space disadvantage it is easy to lose your pieces since they are stepping on each other’s toes.

**17.f4!**

Black’s centralized knight is trapped.

**17...Nxg4 18.Qxg4 Nf6 19.Qf3**

**1-0**

**What we have learned:**

- When you have a space advantage — avoid exchanges.

- Pushing your pawns (at the right moment!) will increase your space advantage and cramp your opponent pieces.

**Game 18**

**Ionov — Yandemirov**

Russian Championship 1994

**l.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 Nf6**

A patent of Aron Nimzowitsch. By counterattacking against the e4-pawn Black plans to rapidly finish his kingside development.

**4.dxe5!**

The text move punishes Blacks move order. Instead White can allow Black to reach the standard lines of Hanham’s Defense with: 4.Nc3 Nbd7 5.Bc4 (Recently Grandmaster Alexey Shirov has employed a pawn sacrifice with 5.g4!? which leads to a sharp and interesting game.) 5...Be7 Black is completing his development and avoiding immediate danger. If White attempts to catch a big fish immediately then it will backfire: 6.Ng5?! O-O 7.Bxf7 Rxf7 8.Ne6 Qe8 9.Nxc7 Qd8 10.Nxa8 (Note that 10.Ne6? is not a repetition, as with the c7-pawn gone, Black can win with either 10...Qb6 or 10...Qa5.) 10...b5! This leads to a messy position, where Black’s first idea is ...Bb7. 1 l.dxe5 Nxe5 White has a temporary material advantage, but Black’s initiative is a much more significant factor. 12.f4 (12.Nxb5 Qa5 13.Nc3 Nxe4 is also better for Black.) 12...Bg4 13.Qd2 Nc4 14.Qd3 Qxa8 Black’s pieces are very active, Herzog - Bezold, Austria 2000.

**4...Nxe4 5.Qd5!**

This energetic move keeps the better game for White. Instead after the natural 5.Bc4 c6! 6.Nbd2 Nxd2 7.Bxd2 d5 8.Bd3 Be7 White is only slightly better.

**5...Nc5**

Instead 5...f5 weakens Black’s position too much, and after 6.Bc4! Qe7 7.O-O! White is much better.

**6.Bg5 Be7**

It is also not so simple for Black after 6...Qd7, as following 7.exd6 Bxd6 8.Nc3 O-O 9.O-O-O Nc6 10.Nb5! White was definitely better in Tiviakov - Barbero, Imperia 1993.

**7.exd6 Qxd6 8.Nc3 Ne6**

Trading queens with 8...Qxd5 9.Nxd5 Bd6 10.O-O-O led to the better game for White in J. Howell - Tepper, Pardubice 1994.

**9.Bxe7 Qxe7 10.O-O-O**

White has the better development and more space; Black has difficulties bringing his bishop into the game.

**10...Nc6 11.Qe4!**

Freeing the d5-square for the c3-knight.

**11...Qb4 12.Bc4**

Development! Black has to spend more time moving his strongest piece, so White is gaining more tempos.

**12...O-O 13.Nd5 Qc5 14.Qh4**

Keeping an eye on the kingside.


**14...Rd8?! 15.Rhe1!**

Centralization! Black’s bishop is still stuck on c8, so White is dominating.

**15...b5 16.Bb3 Bb7??**

Black has finally completed his development, but this move leads to an immediate disaster. White to move! Please find the decisive combination...


***White to play! - How to execute the attack!***

**17.Rxe6! a5**

Or 17...fxe6 18.Ng5 exd5 (18...h6 loses to 19.Nxe6 Qd6 20.Nxd8) 19.Qxh7 Kf8 20.Ne6 with a winning fork.

**18.Ng5 h6 19.Rxh6!**


The black king cannot survive against the mating threats, therefore Black resigned. A couple of possible lines are: 19...gxh6 20.Qxh6 and now 20...Qf8 21.Nf6# or 20...Rd6 21.Qh7 Kf8 22.Qxf7#.

**1-0**

**Conclusion**

In the Philidor Defense Black often intends to support his e-pawn to retain a presence in the center, but the position of his minor pieces remains passive.

In the 3...exd4 lines White automatically gains space and accurate play will translate this into a lasting edge.

In general, although White has slightly better chances, Black’s position is rather solid. Such an approach with Black evidently will not appeal to players who have a sharp, attacking style. Black also has to play extremely carefully in the opening stage to avoid immediate disasters, and especially watch out for tactics on the f7-square.
