## 3.g3 Bb4+ 4.Nd2 #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 Bb4+ 4.Nd2 c5!**

I believe 4...c5 is a good solution against the g3-move order in the Nd2-line. The reason that I don't go for the more standard 4...d5 is: 5.Bg2 O-O

(5...dxc4 6.Qa4+ is the big problem.)

6.Ngf3. Here we are not getting the dxc4 and keeping the pawn, as we have castled instead of going a6! that I think is more useful. Because of this, I think that the 3...Bb4+ 4.Nd2 c5! is the more clever move over to not give White what they might want.

**5.dxc5 Bxc5**

We have the same pawn structure as in the 5.Nf3 line, but here White has somewhat more harmonious development, as the d4-knight will not have to move again to c2. Still, Black is ahead in the development and will be doing very well with the policy of developing the fastest way possible and playing d5 when the time is right.

**6.Bg2 Nc6**

The knight belongs on c6 in general here, so it makes sense to put it on c6 right away as castling is not such a hurry yet.

**7.Ngf3 O-O**

We have developed the pieces, and Black is ready to go d5 on the next move, striking in the center. Here White has two ways of trying to deal with this:

**8.O-O d5!**

We are happy to strike in the center, as we are quite active.

**9.a3**

Intending to go b4, to win the tempo on the c5-bishop and then get the c1-bishop to b2 fast. Now we are faced with the question: Do we go a5 or is it too weakening?

**9...a5!**

It is true that we weaken the b5-square here, but it is justified. We can not let White go b4 when the c1-bishop would come to b2 very fast. In addition, such positions are very sharp and often such small things as weak b5-square should not be on top of the priority list.

We prevent White from developing easy, and one should try to not give the opponent what they want for free.

**10.cxd5**

Of course, we do not go 10...Nxd5 here, as the bishop is on c5 and when we take with the knight the position slows down much. When this happens, such factors as the weak b5-square might become a much bigger factor when the game is not so dynamical.

**10...exd5!**

We take with the pawn! Here I think Black has a very good version of the isolated pawns position, I will now show how you should set up your pieces in a good way.

**11.Nb3**

Hitting the c5-bishop, but don't worry we almost always go with the bishop to b6 anyways as it is much less 'loose' here than on c5.

**11...Bb6 12.Nbd4 Re8!**

Maybe thinking about ideas to take on d4 twice and take the e2-pawn, though this is unlikely, it is good to place the rook on e8 early. Later we want Bg4 - and then we see depending on what White does, how we play.

**13.b3 Bg4 14.Bb2 Ne4!**

Choosing the very active setup. This is what I was talking about, that sometimes the rook is perhaps not so needed on c8, as we can go for the more active Ne4 move.

But the rook on e8 and bishop on g4 are almost always needed there. So try to remember this.

**15.Rc1 Qd6**

The most active square for the queen.

**16.Qd3 h5∞**

The same move as played in the GM Shimanov game. This move is inspired by Alpha Zero and can be quite confusing to understand. I think this move is meant as a 'distraction' of some sort when we have the better development, we want White to react to this move in a way that we can use our better development to punish White if they react badly to the h5-push.

In a way, we are just adding a dynamic 'asset' to our position, and White can not really punish it as we are so active.

**17.Rfd1 h4!**

This move gives White huge problems, as 18.gxh4 weakens the king very much. If we can go h4-h3, then that's a very big achievement as the back rank for White will be very weak.

**18.Nxh4 Nxf2 19.Kxf2 Rxe2+−+**

Winning the game right away. This is what I was talking about, we 'distracted' the knight away on f3 by h5-h4 and by this new dynamical possibilities opened up.

Note that after h5-h4 we are almost always happy to just go h3, even if it does not win us something right away.

## 3.g3 Bb4+ 4.Nd2 #2

**5.a3**

In two files, I will be covering the move 5.a3. It is the most critical move and the one you are most likely to face. This move is very critical because White claims the bishop pair.

In the lines with 5.Nf3 and 5.dxc5, White did let Black get quite easy development and with that good play in the center with an equal and free game. Here, however, White puts Black to the test, and we must show something for the fact that we conceded the bishop pair.

**5...Bxd2+**

is forced, as 5...Ba5 would just lose the pawn on c5. We are happy to take the knight on d2, as we will take on d4 and win some time in the center.

**6.Qxd2 cxd4**

The point of Black's play. We argue that White has to somehow recapture this pawn. If White takes with the queen, then we get the knight to c6 with the tempo, and if White plays Nf3, then we have time to strike in the center, using the fact that White is not fully coordinated yet.

**7.Qxd4**

would play into Black's hands, as Nc6 will come with the tempo.

**7...Nc6**

Winning a tempo on the queen. Still, some GMs have even tried this so we go a bit further:

**8.Qh4**

looks very aggressive, putting the queen on h4. White maybe wants to go for Bg5 and perhaps castles long with mating ideas.

Here it is important to know that we do, and we have the very strong novelty:

**8...e5!**

This move is very strong. Preparing Nd4, as the queen is out of the game on h4.

That is quite often how it goes when such a strong piece like the queen goes to the edge of the board where it's not participating so much in the main action, that White will have a hard time dealing with such simple threats as Nd4 and Nc2+.

**9.Bg5**

Consistent and what White would play, if 8.Qh4 is played.

**9...Qa5+**

A very good move, going out of the pin on the d8-g5 diagonal.

**10.Bd2**

10.Kd1 is met by 10...Nd4!.

10.b4 is met by 10...Nxb4!.

**10...Qb6∓**

We played Qa5+ first to force the bishop to d2 after we happily go Qb6 as the bishop is more passive on d2. Now White is in an awkward spot, as the aggression shown in Qh4 does not really match the reality on the board.

If 11.O-O-O then f2 is hanging, and in rest, it is not easy to see how to defend the b2-pawn in a good way.

**11.Bc3 d5**

White can not survive, as White has wasted way too much time with the queen and the bishop. 12.cxd5 Nxd5 is bad news, and if not, then d5-d4 is coming. Black is close to winning.

## 3.g3 Bb4+ 4.Nc3

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 Bb4+ 4.Nc3**

In this chapter we are going to look at the 4.Nc3 move. Play can transpose to the g3-Nimzo Indian, it might also transpose to the Ragozin Defense in case you play it with Black. So it is definitely critical and needs to be looked at carefully.

In general in the mainlines, we are going to get to many positions where we get to take the pawn on c4, and we will learn how to defend and how to play the arising positions. But in this chapter and in the next chapter, we are going to look at the 6th. sidelines that White can try to throw Black of the balance.

**4...O-O 5.Bg2**

5.Nf3 transposes to lines with 3.Nf3.

**5...d5**

Challenging the center, giving White some options on how to play.

**6.Qb3**

This sort of move can look good at first sight, but the problem is that White is lacking in development and Black strikes in the center with:

**6...c5⩱**

We should have confidence that our setup is sound and not fear complications in the center. White is not really ready for the complications in the center.

**7.dxc5 Nc6 8.a3 Bxc5**

Black regains the c5-pawn and is doing great. White has spent much time on this Qb3-move, but the problem for White is that if White takes the d5-pawn, the files will be opened much more up, and Black can take advantage of this by using the activity of the pieces.

**9.Nf3**

is not good due to:

**9...Na5!**

Black hits the c4-pawn and the queen on b3. White might think they can save himself with Qb5 but we have the very strong:

**10.Qb5 d4!**

A strong tactical shot. As Qxc5 is always met by Nb3!, forking the queen and the rook on a1, this move is justified.

**11.Nb1**

would be very bad, as the same tactical trick works for Black, and the knight is very passive on b1.

**11...Bd7! 12.Qxc5 Nb3**

The white queen's awkward placement leads to the loss of the rook on a1. Since Black is so active, the compensation for White does not exist.

**13.Qe5 Nxa1**

Black is just winning in fact. 14.Nxd4 fails due to 14...Ng4! 15.Qe4 e5! where Black’s pieces are just crushing.

If 14.O-O then Nb3 is good, when the exchange up will count for much soon.

## 3.g3 Bb4+ 4.Bd2 #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 Bb4+ 3.g3 Bb4+**

The move order we play in our repertoire against 3.g3.

**4.Bd2 Be7**

Now that the bishop has gone to d2, we happily retreat to e7. The bishop stands better on c1 than on d2, because from c1 it can be developed to b2, where it would stand best.

As we will see in this variation, it is a frequently occurring theme that White's dark square bishop does not know where to go. After it goes to f4, Black often goes Nh5! to kick it away. This is why the Bb4+ variation is such a good line and has a very good reputation.

Now let's get into the theory!

**5.Bg2 d5 6.Nf3 O-O 7.O-O**

The mainline. 7.Qc2 is covered in the course, too.

**7...Nbd7**

The move I am going to recommend in this course. The reason is that Nbd7 develops a piece, while 7...c6 - the other main option- does not, quite simply.

In some sidelines, we might want to go c5 in one go without having to play c6-c5, and in the Qb3-line, we can go for Nb6 later.

Though, it is likely to transpose to 7...c6 if White plays the mainline. So it is a matter of choice I believe.

**8.c5**

White takes space on the queenside. The downside for White is that it releases the tension, and Black gets very good play by:

**8...Ne4!**

Getting ready to go f5! This becomes a lot more attractive as White has played c5. When the center is more of a closed nature, f5 does not weaken so much as it's much harder to exploit it for White.

**9.Bf4**

Most natural, as it keeps the dark square bishop.

**9...c6**

A solid move, that we include at some point anyway.

**10.Nbd2 g5 11.Be3 f5!**

Black is justified doing this, because White closed the position with c5. We take as much space as possible.

**12.Nxe4**

The only move, as f5-f4 is a threat to win a piece.

**12...dxe4**

The best recapture, keeping the impressive pawns on the kingside.

**13.Ne5 Nxe5**

Taking before White goes Qc2, followed by putting a rook on the d-file.

**14.dxe5 Qd5!**

A very important move. Not letting White have the d-file for free. Now we want to take on e5 or go f4. Play might continue:

**15.Qxd5? exd5**

would be a huge mistake by White when after:

**16.f4 exf3 17.Bxf3 Kf7∓**

Black is much better after the king reaches e6.

## 3.g3 Bb4+ 4.Bd2 #2

**15.Qd4**

is less forcing, as we do not win the e5-pawn. Here I recommend:

**15...b6!**

Preparing Bxc5. If White goes:

**16.cxb6? Qxd4 17.Bxd4 c5**

, followed by axb6 gives Black a huge advantage.

## 3.Nf3 & 5.Bd2 #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.g3 Bb4+ 5.Bd2**

We reach the mainline of the Bb4+ Catalan. We are now going to be covering the 5.Bd2 move order and some dangerous sidelines that White can try. Here Black has some options, we can play a5, we can go Bd6, we can perhaps even go c5. But all of these moves I do not think are as correct as 5...Be7.

The bishop stands best at e7, and we are just happy to have lured the White bishop on d2. As we will see in many variations, the bishop on d2 does not know exactly where it belongs, as it would actually be best in most cases on b2.

This is the entire point behind the Bb4+ system of the Catalan, and is an important point to stress as I believe one should understand why to play an opening system.

Note that the move order in the case of the Bd2 complex does not matter, as in 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 Bb4+ 4.Bd2, we anyway go Be7 and we are going to reach the same variations as in the 3.Nf3 move order.

**5...Be7 6.Bg2 O-O**

Castling, as 6...dxc4 would not give Black anything as White could go 7.Qa4+ and pick up the c4-pawn. This would lead to a very bad situation for Black, where White will have a very strong bishop on g2 and can push e4 much easier.

We should only take on c4 if White can not gain this pawn back or has to make some concessions to regain it, such as weakening the pawn structure or allowing Black to develop many pieces.

**7.Nc3**

A rare move. In general, the players that go for the Bd2-variations are less likely to go for such risky variations as 7.Nc3 as they generally are quite happy with a small positional edge if they can find it. 7.Nc3 is very aggressive, delaying castling and if we play as usual then White can think about going for ideas with c5.

**7...dxc4!**

The correct approach. Here as I explained the reason for 6...O-O, White does not have an easy way to regain the c4-pawn. This is the only case that dxc4 is good when it's not easy to regain the pawn or must make confessions to get it back.<level start="6...O-O" value="+1"/>

In addition, if we would have made a natural looking developing move like 7...Nbd7 as is the usual move order I recommend, then White can go 8.c5!. This is something we should avoid I think.

**8.Qa4**

Intending to regain the c4-pawn, but with this White makes a concession. We now get to develop our c8-bishop easily, and after this, we have neutralized the bishop on g2 and are doing very fine!

**8...a6**

A strong move, when White takes on c4 with the queen, b5 followed by Bb7 is coming. We have solved the issue of the c8-bishop and can later follow up with Nbd7 and c5.

**9.Qxc4 b5**

White regained the pawn, but we develop the bishop to b7 in the meantime and thus, neutralize the g2-bishop.

**10.Qd3**

The best square for the queen, but Black should have no problems.

**10...Bb7**

As we have developed the bishop to b7, we are now soon ready to play c5. After this, we have completed our goal and Black is very much fine.

**11.O-O Nbd7**

Intending to go c5 next with a perfect position.

I like this move more than 11...c5, as I would like to recapture the pawn on c5 with the knight. Often in chess, the knight perhaps stands better on c6 as it controls the d4 and e5-square, rather than from d7 where it just controls e5 as the central squares. But in the Catalan, very often the knight should go to d7, as for the concrete reason here: If the knight went to c6, it would pin the own bishop on b7 in the g2 diagonal and all kinds of Ne5 motives can come into play. So keep in mind that we often go Nd7 in the Catalan with Black!.

**12.Ne5**

Trying to make c5 a bit more awkward for Black.

**12...Bxg2**

We are happy to get the bishops off the board.

**13.Kxg2 c5**

13...Nxe5 is also very much fine, when White is left with a weak d3-pawn after 14.dxe5 Qxd3 15.exd3. It is a matter of choice. I like here c5, as it's very much the classic way to handle the position.

**14.Nc6**

The only critical option. 14.a4 is met by 14...c4! this works as if 15.Qf3 we can play 15...Nxe5, and the d2-bishop would fall.

**14...Qe8**

At first glance, the knight on c6 looks dangerous, but it is only temporary as we play Rac8 next and force the knight to take on e7, with equal play.

**15.a4**

Challenging the queenside:

**15...cxd4 16.Nxe7+**

If 16.Qxd4 then 16...Bc5! is strong. I do not think White should allow the bishop to stay alive if the position opens up.

**16...Qxe7 17.Qxd4 Nc5**

Going for Nb3 and activating the knight.

**18.Qb4**

Here we have the strong move:

**18...a5! 19.Qxb5 Rab8**

Black takes over the initiative!

**20.Qc6**

20.Qxa5 is met by 20...Nb3.

**20...Rfc8 21.Qf3 Rxb2**

I think Black has no problems, due to the active rooks and the symmetrical pawns situation on the board. 8.Qa4 wins the pawn back on c4, but as we see that since the queen had to go via a4, we had time for the a6-b5 push, as is very often the case in the Catalan.

White was never in time to play the e2-e4 push, as Black was just too quick with the Nbd7-c5 counterplay and equalizes very easily with this. I think it's important to realize when it's good to take on c4 and when it's not.

## 3.Nf3 & 5.Bd2 #2

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.g3 Bb4+ 5.Bd2 Be7 6.Bg2 O-O 7.O-O Nbd7 8.Qc2 c6 9.Rd1**

9.Bf4 transposes to the mainline covered in chapter 3 and chapter 4.

9.b3 transposes to the variation covered in chapter 5.

**9...b6 10.b3**

Stabilizing the center, and intending to solve the problem of the d2-bishop by developing it to c3 as the c4-pawn is no longer hanging. However, this has its own price as it loses much time and we can with confidence go for the Stonewall setup if White allows.

**10...a5!**

10...Ba6 is met by 11.a4, the bishop can be hit by a4-a5 and it is a bit annoying so I like to wait with Ba6.

10...a5 is a clever waiting move. In general, I like to play a5 before I go Ba6 for the reasons mentioned above, and in many positions a5-a4 is a good move, leading to complications.

**11.Bc1**

is an interesting move, just intending to play Bb2 where the bishop is ideally placed.

**11...Ba6 12.Bb2 Rc8**

We go for the normal setup, preparing c5! This is generally how Black wishes to play. As long as White does not go for a challenging set-up, we have the time to play like this.

**13.Nbd2 c5! 14.Rac1 b5∞**

With 11.Bc1, White got what they wanted with the bishop ideally placed on b2, but it gave Black time. We have in the meantime started the counterplay in the center and on the queenside with b5.

The position is quite unclear with chances for both sides. Black can not be unhappy with the outcome of the opening.

## 3.Nf3 & 5.Bd2 #3

**11.Bc3**

The main-move. Intending Nd2 , with a harmonious position.

**11...Ne4**

11...Ba6 12.Nbd2 would justify White's setup fully, as e4 is coming fast. The point behind 11...Ne4 is to prevent Nd2 and at the same time hitting the bishop on c3.

Here White has a few options:

**12.Bb2**

At last, White got the bishop to b2. From here it is not as promising to go for the c5 pushes in general, as the bishop would get a great line from b2-g7 after dxc5.

The problem with playing b3-Bc3 and Bb2 for White is that it lost time. I advise now to change plans: to not help the bishop become stronger on b2 with c5, but to go for the Stonewall.

But see, I only advise the Stonewall-setup when I believe it is justified, such as here.

**12...f5!**

Now that White used time to get the bishop to b2, we are ready to play f5, with a very good version of the Stonewall setup for Black. The Stonewall is famous for the pawn formation c6-d5-e6-f5.

Magnus Carlsen said in his course on the Stonewall, that he believes the Bb4-Catalan with Bd2 to be the best possible version of the Stonewall for Black.

Here it is a good version of the Stonewall inside the Bb4-Bd2 Catalan even, as White has spent much time getting the bishop to b2. Black in the meantime has played b6-a5, I think this is very good for Black as the counterplay on the queenside goes much slower for White because of this.

**13.Nc3**

Played by 3 2600 Grandmasters, so we have to look at it. White wants to develop the knight from another way- e3 followed by Ne2 and Nf4-Nd3. A more hidden plan!

**13...Ba6**

The bishop stands very well here, preparing b5! This is very important, in order to now let White get the setup with the knight on d3.

**14.e3**

A solid move, starting the idea with Ne2-Nf4. Here I recommend getting counterplay with:

**14...b5**

Pressure! White is forced to do something with the c4-pawn.

**15.c5**

Closing the queenside was practically forced as 15.cxd5 would help Black much since the c-file is opened after 15...cxd5.

**15...b4**

Opening the a6-bishop.

**16.Ne2**

The plan for White.

**16...h5!**

16...a4 was played by GM Cheparinov, a very strong opening theoretician. It shows an important plan for Black, but here I think we have something even stronger.

16...h5 is a very strong move, showing aggressive intentions on the kingside. I also very much like that we have played a5 also, as we take space both on the kingside and the queenside.

**17.Nf4**

Now we have a very cool move, going for caveman attack on the h-file!

**17...Kf7!**

A very strong move, intending h4 and the rook can swing fast to h8! We are not worried about the king being on f7, as the center is very much closed. Black takes over the initiative in fact, here are some sample lines:

**18.Nd3**

We simply take and are doing great due to space on the queenside and the kingside.

**18...Bxd3!**

Trading the knight so it does not come to e5!

**19.Qxd3 g5**

g4 is coming. It is important to not let the knight reach e5.

## 3.Nf3 & 5.Bd2 #4

**9.Bf4 b6 10.Rd1 Bb7**

10...Ba6 is the other option. There is nothing objectively wrong with it, I just find that it is harder to remember and feel the lines here as it's very much move by move based to justify the bishop going to the more vulnerable a6-square.

10...Bb7 is the mainline and is what I am going to recommend as I feel it is most natural to cover the c6-square and that the bishop just stands best here.

**11.Nbd2**

Preparing e4, but the problem is that the knight blocks the f4-bishop so that it can't go to c1 or d2. Black exploits this very nicely by going:

**11...Nh5**

A very common theme, not giving the bishop an easy life.

**12.Ne5**

does not work well here:

**12...Nxf4 13.gxf4 Nxe5!**

Giving Black a very good game, as we are ready to open up the center right away and use the bishop pair:

**14.fxe5 f6**

After the position opens up, White's king not so high safety and Black's bishop pair will give us a big advantage.

## 3.Nf3 & 5.Bd2 #5

**8.Qc2**

The absolute main move, protecting c4 and making the way for the rook on f1.

**8...c6**

Very solid. We do not go 8...b6 due to 9.cxd5 exd5 10.Qc6.

**9.Bf4**

The Bishop on d2 tries to find itself a stable place to stay and on f4 it is standing well. Later, Black is going to kick it away with ...Nh5! as we soon will see.

**9...b6**

The mainline. It solves the problem of the c8-bishop, and we can develop it either to b7 or to a6.

**10.Rd1**

White realizes that the rook is most likely going to be the most useful on the d-file, as the rook from a1 can go to c1, where it is ideally placed.

**10...Bb7**

The move I like the most. The reason for this is that in 10...Ba6 we have to remember many concrete variations in order to make it work, and the bishop feels a bit unsafe on a6 in my opinion.

I believe 10...Bb7 is a good solution. It keeps the position very solid.

**11.Ne5**

Critical, as it develops the pieces in an aggressive way. If it is White to move next, then White might consider going Nc3, when the development will be secured and e4 might be on the cards.

The knight from e5 is protecting the c4-pawn, so we do not have the usual dxc4 on the Nc3 move. Hence we must react in a good way:

**11...Nh5!**

11...Rc8 would be not so good after 12.Nc3. Black is in trouble, as we are very passive and dxc4 does not work due to the e5-knight, and e4 is coming.

11...Nxe5 12.dxe5 Nd7 might look solid but after 13.e4! White gets an edge. Nh5 is an important move to remember. The bishop stands very well on f4, with Nh5 we ask White where to place it. This is the idea behind the Bb4-Bd2-Be7 Catalan, that the dark-squared bishop constantly struggles to find a home for itself. On f4 it is too active- choose again!

**12.Bc1**

Not so popular as 12.Bd2, as the bishop is more active on d2. However, there is one advantage of playing Bc1 and that is that the d-file is semi-open for the rook on d1.

**12...Nhf6**

12...f5 is an option in case you are in a must-win. It is an interesting Stonewall and certainly playable. The knight has done its job now that the bishop is not on f4. If White goes back to f4, we obviously go Nh5 again leaving White with the same question.

**13.Nc3**

The only point behind 12. Bc1. Now White asks us what we are going to do with the knight on e5. If we do nothing, then e4 might come. Hence we should know concretely how to deal with this:

**13...Nxe5!**

This works here!

**14.dxe5 Ng4**

14...Nd7 would be too passive, and after 15.cxd5 cxd5 16.e4! White would be better. Now with the bishop on c1 rather than f4, the complications work out better for Black as Ng4 is an option, hitting the e5-pawn.

**15.e4**

The most critical move.

**15...d4**

15...Bc5 would not be so clear here after 16.cxd5!

With 15...d4 we do not let the d-file open up for now, and we want perhaps to take on e5.

**16.Bf4**

is again not good as we go:

**16...g5!**

We are winning the e5-pawn. White can try the same tactic as before but Black is better after:

**17.Bf3 Nxh2**

This is even stronger than 17...Nxf2, as the white queen does not get activated.

**18.Kxh2 gxf4 19.gxf4 Kh8−+**

A very strong idea, not giving White the g-file for free. Next, we can go Bc5 and the h4-square is for Black's queen. Black is winning.

## 3.Nf3 & 5.Nbd2 #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.g3 Bb4+ 5.Nbd2 dxc4 6.Qc2**

The point behind 6.Qc2 is to be ready to go b3 at some point without having to worry about c4-c3.

**6...b5**

We should not let White grab the pawn on c4 for nothing.

**7.a4!**

Not allowing Black to go Bb7, as c6 is forced and the bishop will not be as active on b7 with c6 included.

**7...c6 8.Bg2**

This is the correct move order for White.

**8...Bb7**

White has compensation now since our b7-bishop is kind of passive on b7. Still, it does a very good defensive job. If Black manages to play c5, it will be very active.

**9.O-O O-O 10.e4 h6N**

Similar idea as I showed in the Nc3-line with the 8.e3 in the mainline. Black wants to stop White from playing e5-Ng5! When White goes e4, it is often smart to go h6!

**11.e5 Nd5 12.Ne4 Nd7**

with a very common scenario. White is down a pawn and must play for the attack. I'm not a big fan of White's attack, and my experience as a White player in similar situations has taught me that it's a lot easier to play with Black.

**13.Bd2 a5**

If White trades the dark-squared bishops it will be on Black's terms. a5 is very nice, getting super active on the queenside as I believe White does not have enough for the pawn deficit.

**14.b3**

Trying to open up the queenside.

**14...cxb3 15.Qxb3 bxa4**

A strong move, as we will see in several positions we like to take such a pawn in order after:

**16.Rxa4 Ba6**

Carlsen,M (2714) - Ivanisevic,I (2607) Heraklion 2007; Followed by Bb5, and Black was much better.

15...bxa4 might look a bit ugly but it greatly activates the light-squared bishop and we can later go Bb5.

## 3.Nf3 & 5.Nbd2 #2

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.g3 Bb4+ 5.Nbd2 dxc4! 6.Bg2**

The mainline and what White is most likely to play. The lines in these files are very crazy, some of them are forced and have to be memorized, while others are more about ideas in attack with many options for both sides.

**6...b5!**

Black will castle soon, but for now it is most important to protect the c4-pawn! This is the whole point behind the early dxc4 move. We are committed to keeping the c4-pawn before castling.

**7.O-O O-O 8.b3!?**

This is not dangerous, but we should remember the following move.

**8...c3!**

This is strong, disturbing the white coordination.

**9.Nb1 Bb7**

with the idea 10...Be4!<addz start="10...Be4"/>

**10.Qd3 Be4 11.Qxb5**

was played in a game recently, but after:

**11...Nc6!**

Black is close to winning.

**12.Be3 Rb8 13.Qg5 h6 14.Qh4 Ne7**

Look at the c3-pawn and the fact that the White queen is getting trapped - Black is winning.

## 3.Nf3 & 5.Nbd2 #3

**7.O-O O-O 8.a4**

The mainline.

**8...c6**

Reaching the main discussion of the whole 6.Bg2-line. The variations are very sharp and double-edged, with White often sacrificing several pawns in order to get activity.

**9.axb5**

White generally does not take on b5 because it clears the tension. But here White has a concrete idea in mind:

**9...cxb5 10.Ng5!**

This line is quite forced, so important to remember:

**10...Nd5 11.e4 Nc7**

We go to c7, since the knight protects the rook on a8 from here.

**12.Nxh7**

The point of the variation. White can get this by force, so we have to know this line:

**12...Kxh7 13.e5**

Intending to take the a8-rook or to just go Qh5-Ne4 with a big attack. I like here the move:

**13...g6!**

Making sure that there will be no Qh5+ and after:

**14.Bxa8 Nxa8 15.Rxa7? Qxd4**

leads to disaster. An IM once lost this way.

**16.Rxa8 Bb7! 17.Ra1 Rd8**

And Black won the piece back on d2 and has clearly the superior pieces. Black is completely winning.

## 3.Nf3 & 5.Nbd2 #4

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.g3 Bb4+ 5.Nbd2 dxc4**

5...O-O is indeed the mainline. But the reason I don't like it as much as 5...dxc4 is: 6.Bg2 dxc4 7.a3! asks Black some questions after 7...Bxd2+ 8.Bxd2 And so we should go for some other lines, but generally, I found that White is not risking much and can in some lines get a small plus.<level start="5...dxc4" value="+1"/>

Hence I believe after 5...dxc4, Black fights on equal terms and can play for the win. I have found out through study and with the help of the strongest engines that 5...dxc4 is the best move, better than the mainline 5...O-O.

Now, it is not possible for Black to play this move order if White starts with 3.g3. Hence I believe it would be best to advise something else against the g3-Nd2 move order and to give the 5...dxc4 here. I believe in giving the best option even if it means walking the extra mile of work.<level start="3.g3" value="+1"/>

**6.a3**

The critical move, asking what we want to do with the bishop.

**6...Bxd2+**

We have to take on d2, as if we move the bishop to e7, for example, White will just take on c4 for nothing and has more central control.

**7.Bxd2 a6!**

A move that has only been played 4 times before, though I think it is the strongest! Black waits with castling and is prepared to hold on to the c4-pawn for dear life. White must in most lines sacrifice with b2-b3 to get active play. Thus, we reach positions that are heavily unbalanced and play can get very sharp.

Though I think it's important to have in mind that since this line is very new, you can expect that White will be surprised and not react in the best way.

**8.a4**

Trying to stop b5 is not very dangerous, we go:

**8...b6!**

8...b5 does not work due to 9.axb5. We want to go Bb7 next move.

**9.Rc1**

This looks promising, but now as the rook left the a-file, we can go:

**9...b5!**

And we keep the pawn. A sample line than can follow is:

**10.Bg2 Bb7 11.b3 cxb3 12.Qxb3 Bd5 13.Qb2 O-O**

We just castle as if White takes on b5 then the a-file is open, and we can take advantage of this by:

**14.axb5 axb5 15.Qxb5 Nc6!**

A strong move, putting huge pressure on the d4-pawn. If White takes on c6 then:

**16.Rxc6 Qe8**

This just wins the exchange.

## 3.Nf3 & 5.Nbd2 #5

**8.Bg2 b5**

This ensures that White will have to sacrifice a pawn. But the positions arising are very sharp and dangerous for both colours.

**9.O-O**

After this logical move, which is what has been played in 2 of the 4 games in these lines, Black is already better after:

**9...Bb7**

White has a hard time proving their compensation if lets Black play Bb7 and finish development in an easy way. Therefore Ne5 is more critical since it forces Ra7 where it stands a bit clumsy.

**10.b3**

White needs to challenge the c4-pawn at some point.

**10...cxb3 11.Qxb3 O-O**

I believe White's compensation is not enough at all and that we are much better with Black. A game continued here:

**12.Rac1 Bd5 13.Qb2 Nbd7 14.Bg5 c6**

Rekhtman, P (2258)-Kochan,I (2214) ICCF email 2016; An idea worth keeping in mind, making the queenside solid as a rock. Black was much better and went on to win.

## 3.Nf3 & 5.Nc3 #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.g3 Bb4+ 5.Nc3 O-O**

In chapter 15 we look at the possible sidelines that White could try in the 3.g3 move order.

Here, we will look at the possible sidelines for White on move 6 in the 3.Nf3 move order. Let's get into it!

**6.a3**

Asking what we want to do with our bishop.

**6...Bxc3+**

If White would have included cxd5 then it would have made sense to retreat the bishop as we can get out bishop on c8 easy into the game. Here however we need to play energetically to compensate for a potential good vs bad bishop on g2 and c8.

**7.bxc3 Ne4!**

Playing concretely. We want to take White's c3-pawn, and White has to find some way to deal with it.

**8.Qc2 Nc6!**

The knight is not planning to stay on c6 for long:

**9.Bg2 Na5**

A very strong idea worth keeping in mind! It is quite an instructive idea in the Nimzo in many positions.

The idea is that after cxd5 exd5, the c3-pawn is very weak, and we control the c4-square in front of this pawn, so it's nearly impossible to get rid of this weakness.

**10.cxd5 exd5**

With a very good position for Black. We can continue with Bf5, now that the bishop is opened up.

Later, we go Re8 to take the open file. Then the standard c5 move will be very effective, giving Black good counterplay.

In addition, the knight can occupy the strong c4-square, dominating the c1-bishop.

## 3.Nf3 & 5.Nc3 #2

**6.Qb3**

6.Bg2 is the mainline.

**6...c5**

Rule of thumb: when White goes Qb3, almost always c5 is a good reply.

**7.dxc5 Nc6!**

We want to play d4 now.

**8.Bg5 h6 9.Bxf6 Qxf6**

Black has the bishop pair, and the pawn on c5 can be taken back when we want. Thus, reaching a very nice position with the bishop pair in an open position.

**10.a3 Bxc5 11.cxd5 Nd4!**

is strong, forcing Nxd4 after we take back and the pawn on f2 is being threatened.

**12.Nxd4 Bxd4 13.Ne4**

If 13.e3 we just take on c3 and then on d5. Black is better as the c3-pawn will be weak.

**13...Qe5 14.Bg2 exd5**

Regaining the pawn with a great position. We have the bishop pair and a strong isolated pawn here.

**15.Nc3 Rd8 16.O-O Be6∓**

We can decide when is the right moment to take the knight on c3, leaving White with a weaker c3-pawn than Black's d5. The dynamic possibilities for Black here are not to be underestimated.

## 3.Nf3 & 5.Nc3 #3

**6.Bg2 dxc4**

In this chapter we are going to look at the move 7.a3 in the Nc3-line. It is a move that is quite good and you need to know how to play versus it.

Often, I see in practice that Black lets the g2-bishop become like a monster. Hence, we should try to avoid this!

**7.a3**

A critical line and not easy to deal with over the board in case you do not know it because the bishop on g2 is very good. So here it is important to know move by move what to do with Black.

**7...Bxc3+!**

We take this knight, as 7...Be7 does not give Black any clear benefits. Here activity is very important, the knight stands very well on c3 so we take it off.

**8.bxc3 c5**

The standard reply for Black in this variation. Here White has quite some options.

**9.O-O**

By far the mainline, played in 95% of the games.

**9...cxd4!**

A very rare move, giving White a choice what to recapture with. I think this move is very strong, as we 'soften' the d4-pawn, so we can go Nc6 and attack the center.

In addition, this does not allow White to go for any dxc5, where it might be a bit troublesome to regain the c5-pawn in a good way.

**10.cxd4 Bd7!**

Following the idea that if we can neutralize the Catalan g2-bishop by putting it on the same diagonal, we should be doing fine.

**11.Qc2 Bc6 12.Qxc4 Bd5**

A standard maneuver in the Catalan. White does not really get anywhere in such a scenario like this when the bishop stands very well on the c6-g2 diagonal.

**13.Qb4**

We are fine in many ways, but I like the concrete:

**13...Nc6! 14.Qxb7**

Going for concrete play, but Black is very active:

**14...Nxd4**

With easy equality. If you remember up to this moment that is great, the rest kind of plays itself.

**15.Qb2 Bxf3!**

Taking off the knight on f3, as now the knight stands great on d4. Next, we want to go Rb8 and play for the initiative.

**16.exf3**

The only 'ambitious' move, but Black is just better after:

**16...Rb8 17.Qd2 e5⩱**

The knight on d4 is being helped by the move e5. Next, we want perhaps to put a rook on the d-file.

Black has the initiative due to the activity of its pieces. The b-file and the strong knight on d4.

## 3.Nf3 & 5.Nc3 #4

**7.O-O**

We finally reach the mainline. In this chapter, we will be covering the lines: 8.Bg5, 8.Re1 and 8.e3. These lines are somewhat rarer than the moves 8.Qa4 and 8.a3, which I will cover in the next chapter, still they are important to know.<add start="8.Bg5" value="7...Nc6"/>

As we will see in the two following chapters that: White has sacrificed a pawn and tries to get compensation by means of attack or just superior pieces.

If White aims to just win the pawn back, then we should get a good game by means of developing our pieces harmoniously. Black on the other hand will try to hang on to his pawns for dear life by Nc6, Rb8 and b5.

Let's get into the concrete lines!

**7...Nc6!**

The best move and the mainline. We prepare to go Rb8, followed by b5.

A move like 7...Nbd7 would be too passive, as it does not put pressure on the d4-pawn also.

**8.Bg5**

The third most popular move in this position, so definitely much played.

**8...h6**

Dealing with the pin straight away.

**9.Bxf6**

White claims that the bishop pair does not matter here, because the queen is misplaced and if White can win the c4-pawn then the center can give him the advantage.

**9...Qxf6**

Now White has a big choice.

**10.e3**

The main move.

**10...Rb8!**

The standard move in almost all positions. We go Rb8 so we can go b5. The rook supports the b5-pawn and we go out from Ne5 ideas.

**11.Ne4**

Hitting the queen and preparing Nfd2.

**11...Qf5 12.Nfd2 b5 13.a4 a6**

keeps the pawn for Black.

**14.b3 Na5 15.axb5 axb5 16.bxc4 bxc4∓**

White never has sufficient compensation in such positions, a pawn is a pawn. It's only if some other big factors such as king safety or that Black has very poor pieces that it can be justified.

But here it's really not the case.

## 3.Nf3 & 5.Nc3 #5

**8.Qa4**

A very popular move. The queen is very well placed on a4, and it puts pressure on the b4-bishop, as Ne5-ideas are in the air.

If we make a move like 8...Bd7 then after 9.Bg5, White would have pressure on the Black position due to Black finding it hard to develop the queenside.

Here we have to play 8...Nd5.

**8...Nd5**

Going out of Bg5 ideas, and if it's us to move then we simply take on c3.

**9.Qc2**

The white queen claims that the knight is misplaced on d5, e4 is coming with tempo. Here we have to remember a move, and it has a very good point.

White, of course, would love to go e4. We will let White do it, but we are prepared for it with this move:

**9...Be7!**

A very important move to remember. The point is that we need the b4-square for the knight if a potential e4 comes. The bishop sidesteps so the knight can go there.

**10.e4**

Not so promising here, as we can go 10...Ndb4 with very nice counterplay, as the knight reaches d3.

**10...Ndb4! 11.Qd1 Nd3**

We want Nxd4, so 12.Be3 is natural.

**12.Be3 b6!**

A very strong move, just intending Ba6 and not forcing matters. It is not easy for White now.

**13.Qb1**

White has the idea to go Rd1 and then b3, when the d3-knight would be a target. However, this is too slow and Black can remain cool with:

**13...Rb8!**

A strong move, getting ready for b3, when we would go b5!

**14.Rd1 f5!**

A typical idea worth noticing. We break up the center for White, which gives us some juicy squares in the meantime.

**15.b3 f4!**

would be bad news for White, as their king is very weak suddenly.

**16.gxf4 Nxf4 17.Bxf4 Rxf4**

We are happy to give up the c4-pawn, due to the direct attack, Black will get in return.

**18.bxc4 Rxf3!**

Very strong, as d4 is falling.

**19.Bxf3 Nxd4**

The exchange sacrifice is fully justified. White's king is in big trouble and our pieces are simply amazing. Black is close to winning.

## 3.Nf3 & 5.Nc3 #6

**8.a3**

The main move in this position. White asks us what to do with the dark-squared bishop.

We should not take 8...Bxc3, as after bxc3 it is not clear what we have achieved.

8...Be7 is more ambitious, keeping the bishop pair.

**8...Be7 9.e4!**

This position is not easy to play for both sides. It's a constant battle between what matters more, the extra pawn for Black on c4 and the center for White.

I think Black should be doing quite well, but we have to know some defensive ideas in order to withstand the White initiative.

**9...Na5!**

Stepping out of d5 and also supporting our strength, our c4-pawn! 8.a3 is good to prevent Nb4, but it did weaken the b3-square!<level value="+1"/>

This is a major point of 9...Na5 also, that the knight often jumps to b3 as a defensive piece against the attack in the center from White.

**10.Be3 a6**

The standard move, preparing b5.

**11.Qc2**

11.Qe2 transposes to 10.Qe2. The queen feels at home at c2, since it looks down on the c2-h7 diagonal where it might attack Black's weak spot.

This variation is perhaps the most dangerous and objectively best variation that White can go for.

**11...b5!**

We have to play on our strengths in the position.

**12.Rad1 Bb7 13.d5**

The natural move, as all of White's pieces are lined up for this advance.

**13...Qe8!**

The last important move to remember! Stepping out of the d-file and it's not easy for White to continue the initiative. Here is a sample line with good play from both sides.

**14.Bf4 Bd8!**

Defending the c7-pawn.

**15.Rfe1 Nb3**

A common theme in these variations, the knight jumps to b3. The knight takes the d4-square for the f3-knight.

Sometimes it can support c5 itself or disturb White in many different ways. It is not easy for White to get rid of it, so a great piece in general!

**16.d6 cxd6**

16...c5 might be best, but it gives White much play after: 17.e5! Nd7 18.Ne4 h6 19.Qe2! and I think the close nature of the position gives White very good attacking prospects in practice.

16...cxd6 is simplest.

**17.Bxd6 Be7 18.e5 Nd5 19.Ne4 h6!**

Not letting White get to g5. This theme we often see in these lines. Black is a bit better, but White can equalize with precise play.

**20.Nd4 Nxd4 21.Rxd4 Bxd6 22.Nxd6 Qe7**

Even if White gets the pawn back from the pin resulting from Nxb7 Qxb7, we will still have very strong pawns on c4 b5 and a6, which ensures that we are never worse. However, the most likely result is a draw.

8.a3 is a hard line to play from both sides. By knowing the main defending themes by looking at these variations carefully, you should be able to get a very good game. The only way for White to get compensation in these lines is to push for 9.e4 - and to go for an ambitious d5. Often Black will keep the pawn up, but as we saw in the mainline here, White generally gets enough play for the pawn for equality.<level start="8.a3" value="+1"/>
