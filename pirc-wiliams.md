### (6) Quickstarter - Pirc: 5...O-O #1 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3**

Our favourite set-up and now Black must decide whether to fianchetto and play the Pirc, or aim to counter in the center.

**3...g6 4.Be2**

Not such a modest move, as White wants to be able to advance Harry straightaway and in two immediate steps, which he can now that he controls the h5-square.

**4...Bg7 5.h4 O-O 6.h5**

already spells trouble for the black king, as Line A1 will reveal.

### (7) Quickstarter - Pirc: 5...h6 #1 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3**

**3...g6 4.Be2**

**4...Bg7 5.h4 h6**

closes lines, but runs into the powerful

**6.h5 g5 7.f4 gxf4 8.Bxf4**

when Nf3 will follow and White will likely castle long, as we'll see in Line A2.

### (8) Quickstarter - Pirc: 5...c6 #1 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3**

**3...g6 4.Be2**

**4...Bg7 5.h4 c6 6.h5**

ploughs straight ahead and note that hxg6 isn't White's only strong follow-up:

**6...b5**

or 6...gxh5 7.Nh3! Nbd7 8.Nf4 when White can regain the pawn at the optimum moment, as he did in Sharafiev-Kupreichik, Nezhmetdinov Memorial, Kazan 2006.

**7.h6 Bf8 8.e5**

Having gummed up Black's development, White rips open the center and after

**8...dxe5 9.dxe5 Qxd1+ 10.Bxd1**

Black is more than a little vulnerable on the queenside and to tactics down the h1-a8 diagonal, as Line A3 will reveal.

### (9) Quickstarter - Pirc: 5...Nc6 #1 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3**

**3...g6 4.Be2**

**4...Bg7 5.h4 Nc6 6.h5 gxh5**

is a little ugly. Here, and in many lines, White's best policy isn't to grab the pawn straight back, but rather go

**7.Nh3**

and Nf4, as in Line A4.

### (10) Quickstarter - Pirc: 5...c5 #1 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3**

**3...g6 4.Be2**

**4...Bg7 5.h4 c5**

Throughout our Pirc coverage, we aim to meet the ...e5 and ...c5 counters by swapping pawns to open lines, not least here:

**6.dxc5 Qa5 7.Bd2**

Immediately breaking the pin, after which h5 and Nh3 may well follow, as we'll see in Line A5.

### (11) Quickstarter - Pirc: 5...h5 #1 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3**

**3...g6 4.Be2**

**4...Bg7 5.h4 h5**

Black's safest move, halting Harry.

**6.Nf3**

It may look like Black has safely closed the kingside, but matters are not so clear-cut with White's knight now bound for an aggressive home on g5, where, of course, it can no longer be kicked away with ...h6.

**6...O-O 7.Ng5**

Wasting no time bringing the knight to this fine post.

**7...c6**

Black hints at thematic Pirc counterplay with ...b5.

**8.a4**

Restraining ...b5 and we saw White make a good case for this in Barua-Nikolic, Biel Interzonal 1993. This is actually a rare part of the repertoire where you have a choice and 8.O-O followed by Be3 ignoring Black's queenside expansion. This led to another very instructive display in Neubauer-Lehner, Austrian Bundesliga 2017. In both lines note that once White is developed and has control of the central situation, he may well still look to attack the black king, be that with e5-e6 or f4-f5.

### (12) Quickstarter - Pirc: 5...h5 #2 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3**

**3...g6 4.Be2**

**4...Bg7 5.h4 h5**

**6.Nf3**

**6...O-O 7.Ng5**

**7...Nc6**

is probably more critical, but White should still be fairly happy so long as he remembers 'exchanges to open lines in the center':

**8.Be3 e5 9.dxe5**

9.d5 Nd4! is what Black is hoping for.

**9...Nxe5 10.Qd2**

leaves White set to castle long then push his f-pawn and attack, as we cover in Line A6.

### (13) Quickstarter - Pirc: 5...h5 #3 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3**

**3...g6 4.Be2**

**4...Bg7 5.h4 h5**

**6.Nf3**

**6...Nc6**

aims for central counterplay, but

**7.d5**

doesn't entail too much positional risk and after

**7...Ne5 8.Nxe5 dxe5 9.Bg5**

the@then world champion, Garry Kasparov no less, was poised to take control of the position with Qd2 and f3 in Kasparov-Speelman, Paris Immopar (rapid) 1990.

### (34) Pirc Introduction - Pirc #1 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4**

Naturally we seize the central space Black is offering us.

**2...Nf6 3.Nc3**

Another highly natural and standard move, developing while meeting the threat.

**3...g6 4.Be2**

But this modest move may come as a small surprise to your opponent. It is somewhat behind 4.f4 , 4.Nf3 and 4.Be3 , as well as 4.Bg5 and 4.f3 in the popularity stakes, but isn't White just going to go Nf3 next and transpose to the Classical lines? Well... 4.h4!? is the alternative move order. This may well jolt your opponent awake, but it is likely to transpose to our main lines in this chapter once White follows up with Be2 . 4...Bg7 Now 5.Be2 transposes to the mainline, while those of a very aggressive bent may also wish to consider 5.h5!?

**4...Bg7**

The logical follow-up to Black's last and one seen in more than 95% of all games.

**5.h4**

5.g4 and 5.Be3 are far from ridiculous, but we can resist no longer: Harry is deployed. This direct thrust may well come as a surprise to your opponent and even if they have seen it before, such a direct assault is not always so easy to face. Moreover, while that great attacking force of recent times, Baadur Jobava, has championed White's cause here, his position has also appealed to such players as Kapengut, Keres and Spassky, as well as Benjamin, Nakamura and even Kasparov.

**5...Nbd7**

Natural enough development from Black, if also rather compliant. In our detailed coverage ahead, we'll consider his main alternatives in descending order of popularity, which are: 5...O-O 6.h5 rather castles into it and is considered in Line A1.5...h6 6.h5! is another position White most certainly welcomes - see Line A2.5...c6 6.h5 once more rolls ahead - see Line A3. 5...Nc6 is the first of Black's main defenses, or at least ones used by leading Pirc exponents. Here too though White can keep going: 6.h5 is covered in Line A4. 5...c5 is Black's best attempt to obtain immediate counterplay and has been by some margin his second most popular move. White's d-pawn has two options and we'll focus on 6.dxc5 in Line A5. 5...h5 is Black's most sensible move and by some margin his most popular, having been seen in a little over 40% of games to have reached this position. As we should always be asking ourselves, what's the downside to the move? 6.Nf3 reveals it. White will look to settle his knight on the newly weakened g5-square, as we'll see in Line A6. Black's remaining options are pretty rare, including 5...d5?. This works well against 5.g4, but not here: 6.e5 Ne4 7.h5!? Trading knights then go h4-h5 is also pretty good. 7...gxh5 8.Bxh5 .Taking aim at f7. Once again we find White looking to manoeuvre his king's knight from g1 to g5:8...Nxc3 9.bxc3 Bf5 . This was Hausner-B.Houska, Policka 1997, where White had a very strong continuation: 10.Qf3! Bg6 5...e5? once again leads to exchanges down the d-file which White should most certainly welcome: 6.dxe5 dxe5 7.Qxd8+ Kxd8 . Now 8 h5 is on and there's something likely even stronger: 8.Nf3! With tempo, and f7, not e5, is the main target. 8...Nbd7 R.Lamprecht-Pribyl, Bad Griesbach 2007 5...b6?! is an approach which can work against slower white set-ups, but not here: 6.h5 Bb7 7.Bf3 Sensible defense of e4 and a move which also lines up various nasty tactics along the long diagonal, but the engines' preference for the space-gaining 7.h6!? Bf8 8.d5! also makes a lot of sense. 7...Nbd7? 8.h6 Bf8 9.e5! Forcing the pace - and how! 9...Bxf3 10.Nxf3 Ng8 11.e6! The classic breakthrough, although it should be said that 11.Qe2!? is also very strong, and if 11...e6 12.d5!. 11...fxe6 12.Ng5 Ndf6 13.Nxe6 Qd7 14.Qe2 . Talk about a dream opening for White or an octopus knight! Indeed, you could hardly blame Black for resigning here, unable to castle or develop his kingside.<level start="5.g4"/><level start="7.h6"/><level start="11.Qe2"/><level start="11...e6"/>

**6.h5**

Naturally, as allowed, White presses straight ahead.

**6...e5**

Onc@ again, we see this break and, once again, it doesn't bring Black anywhere near to equality. Of course, Black can exchange, but only at some cost to his kingside: 6...Nxh5 7.Bxh5 gxh5 8.Nge2 aims to land the knight on h5, as well as to complete development with Be3 and Qd2, while 6...gxh5 7.Be3 makes good sense to dissuade ...c5. White may preface Qd2 with f3 or just go Bxh5. He can also simply rely on his lead in development, as shown by: 7...e5 (Ortega Serra-Lara Meca, Santa Eulalia de Roncana 2014) 8.Nf3!? Now Nh4-f5 becomes an idea. 8...Ng4 9.Bg5 f6 10.Bd2 and all that Black has achieved is to weaken his kingside light squares.

**7.h6**

By @o means the only good move (you may prefer to retain the tension with 7.Be3), but the first part in a bold, but seemingly very strong plan to squeeze Black to death.

**7...Bf8**

Here White simply developed with 8.Nf3 in Andreikin-Vavulin, Moscow Blitz Championship 2015, and 8.Be3 is again far from shabby, but White can be more ambitious:

**8.g4 d5**

Desperately trying to break free.

**9.Bg5**

White ignores the central tension and ratchets up the pressure by another notch.

**9...Be7**

Breaking the pin. 9...dxe4?? 10.dxe5 would already be game over. 9...exd4 10.Qxd4 Bc5 is a more immediately active try for Black, but unfortunately for him there's no really good follow-up: 11.Qd2 d4 12.Nd5 c6 13.Nxf6+ Nxf6 hopes for 14.e5 Qd5 , which may still favour White, but he can also keep a large advantage through simple means: 14.O-O-O O-O 15.Qf4!? Be7 16.Qe5! c5 17.f4 . Nf3 will follow and it's far from easy for Black to deal with the pressure down the h4-d8 diagonal without allowing a snap mate on g7. Indeed, it's not at all clear how Black can really do anything before he is swept aside after Nf3, Kb1, f5, Bf4 and g5.

**10.exd5 O-O 11.Qd2**

White is just a pawn to the good and also has a certain most useful fish bone lodged right in the black king's throat. Moreover, the d5-pawn is actually quite secure: 11...exd4 12.Qxd4 Nb6 13.O-O-O Here Rh3-e3 is one strong idea and it would be a minor miracle were Black to survive. And if 11...e4 then 12.O-O-O Nb6 13.Bxf6! Bxf6 14.Nxe4 followed by c4.

### (35) Pirc Introduction - Pirc #2 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4**

**2...Nf6 3.Nc3**

**3...g6 4.Be2**

**4...Bg7**

**5.h4**

**5...a6**

is a modern and fairly popular advance in a number of Pirc and Modern lines, but here also just appears a little slow:

**6.h5 b5 7.e5**

White makes the second of our favourite early advances, leaving Black wishing he hadn't weakened himself down the long light-square diagonal.

**7...dxe5**

7...Nfd7 8.h6! Bf8 leaves Black's queenside development, this time, in trouble after 9.Bf3 c6 and White might have even better: 9.e6!? fxe6 10.Nh3 . The idea is clearly Ng5 and there's also Bg4 in reserve, with Black's position again quite likely to resemble an early wreck: 10...Nf6 11.Bf3 d5 12.Bf4 . White clearly has far, far too much for the pawn with Qe2 or Qd3, Ng5 and O-O-O next up, in contrast to which the three pieces on e8, f8 and h8 must all be feeling rather glum.

**8.h6**

Again, this timely advance badly messes up Black's development.

**8...Bf8 9.dxe5 Qxd1+ 10.Bxd1 b4**

10...Ng4 11.Bf4 threatens Nd5, as well as Bf3 and even to embarrass the knight on g4:11...c6 12.Rh4! , and 10...Nfd7 11.Bf3 c6 12.e6! is once again an advance it's almost impossible to resist. The queens might be off, but Black's position is riddled with holes and his queenside can even be further weakened: 12...fxe6 13.a4!? b4 13...Bb7? fails, as so often, to hang on to Black's ill-gotten gains: 14.axb5 axb5 15.Rxa8 Bxa8 16.Nxb5! with the initiative and much the better structure for White. 14.Ne4 . Once again, Nh3-g5 may follow and Black must also take care down the long dark-square diagonal, as well as the light-square one, as we can see from 14...Ne5? 15.b3! Nxf3+ 16.Nxf3 with total domination of the position after Bb2.

**11.Bf3 c6 12.Na4**

Knights on the rim can be dim, but not when they will invade via c5 or b6.12...Nfd7 13.e6! fxe6 14.Nh3 With Ng5 next up, Black's position was once more a right wreck and, objectively speaking, probably already lost in Piay Augusto-Argibay Fontan, Poio 2002.

### (36) Pirc Introduction - Pirc #3 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4**

**2...Nf6 3.Nc3**

**3...g6 4.Be2**

**4...c6**

is a typical enough Pirc move, if one which feels a little slow here. You might decide that you're an h4 player against everything or have been swayed by our coverage of 4...Nbd7 to want to go 5.f4 here when 5...Bg7 6.Nf3 is certainly quite a pleasant set-up for White. So is pushing Harry:

**5.h4 b5**

5...h5 is a better defense when play may well transpose to Line A3:6.Nf3 Bg7 7.Ng5 and we're back in Line A3.

**6.e5**

Pressing straight ahead to exploit White's superior development. 6.h5!? is also quite tempting, since after 6...b4 7.Na4 Nxe4? 8.Bd3 White will regain his pawn with some interest on g6.

**6...dxe5 7.dxe5**

Allowing a queen exchange, but one which will only serve to show how Black has weakened himself on the light squares. 7...Qxd1+ 8.Bxd1 Nd5 9.Nge2 Once again, we find Black's position something of an early wreck. White has ideas of h5, Ne4 and even Nxd5 cxd5; Nd4, leaving Black passive and under early, quite unpleasant pressure. And if 8...Ng4? 9.Nxb5! takes immediate advantage of the downside to ...b5, picking up a pawn or even the exchange: 9...cxb5? 10.Bf3

### (37) Pirc Introduction - Pirc #4 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4**

**2...Nf6 3.Nc3**

**3...g6 4.Be2**

**4...c6**

**5.h4 Qa5**

carries a threat, but should not be overly feared. White can either go 6.Qd3!? then Bd2 or jump on the key diagonal without delay:

**6.Bd2**

Now Black has Nd5 ideas to think about, as well as h4-h5:

**6...Nbd7 7.h5 Nxh5 8.Bxh5 gxh5**

Here White can do even better than recapture the pawn without delay, by bringing a knight over to survey the weakened black kingside:

**9.Nd5 Qd8 10.Nf4**

This was Berezjuk-Ruckschloss, Banska Stiavnica 2006, where Black's kingside was a wreck. Yes, he can exchange a pair of knights, but not easily obtain any real counterplay: 10...Nf6 11.Nxh5!? Nxh5 12.Qxh5 d5 13.e5 White will place his bishop on c3, castle long and increase the pressure with f4-f5 and/or Nf3-g5. If 11...Nxe4 12.Qe2 f5 is a forced move, but Black will face quite some initiative, whether White castles long or goes 13.Bf4 Qa5+ 14.Kf1!? and f2-f3.

### (38) Pirc Introduction - Pirc #5 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4**

**2...Nf6 3.Nc3**

**3...g6 4.Be2**

The rare alternatives are certainly not to be feared.

**4...Nbd7**

can bet met by either 5.h4, as per our main approach, or even

**5.f4**

To avoid being overrun Black really needs to react in the centre, but even that doesn't come even close to equalizing:

**5...e6**

5...e5?! prevents e4-e5, but majorly weakens the dark squares: 6.fxe5 dxe5 7.dxe5 Nxe5 8.Qxd8+ Kxd8 9.Bg5. White's pieces flow to good squares and he can already be delighted with how the opening has gone. Black likely has only one real defensive try : 9...Be7 10.O-O-O+ Nfd7!, 10...Ke8? 11.Nb5 wins 11.Bf4. Keeping pieces on with Black cramped and under pressure: 11...Bd6 12.Nd5!? (Ruling out any annoying ...Nd3+.) 12...f6 13.Bg3! . Nf3 is next up and Black is under severe pressure, and even more if he now makes a natural enough move - and blunder: 13...c6? 14.Nxf6! .<level start="10...Ke8"/>

**6.Nf3 Bg7 7.e5**

White establishes a powerful central bridgehead and there just isn't a good square for the black knight:

**7...Nd5 8.Nxd5 exd5 9.h4**

Keeping up the initiative and aiming to force further weaknesses. 9...h5 10.O-O White enjoys a very attractive set-up, one which might well quickly massacre Black after Ng5 or f4-f5, with even a pin failing to save the second player: 10...Nb6 11.Bd3 Bg4 12.f5! There's never anything as painful as facing a pawn breakthrough which you thought you'd prevented. Now Black must be very careful down the e-file, as well as the f-file. 12...dxe5 13.dxe5 gxf5 13...Bxe5? would be far too greedy: 14.Qe1 14.Bg5 Qd7 15.Qe1! Black's position is a right mess and set to collapse on the light squares after Nd4 or Nh2, while castling queenside is, of course, illegal.

### (39) Pirc Introduction - Pirc 5.e5 #1 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4**

**2...Nf6 3.Nc3**

**3...g6 4.Be2**

**4...a6**

is @nother far from unknown idea in general, but rare here and with fairly good reason. We'll see why 5.h4 Bg7 is good for White below (and 5...h5 6.Nf3 also need not be feared), a pretty decent case can also be made for 5.f4 and there's even the immediate central advance:

**5.e5 Nfd7 6.f4 Bg7 7.Nf3**

Thi@ is an Austrian Attack (4.f4) where Black has rather wasted a move on ...a6 and, as such, he appears unable to even get close to equality:

**7...c5 8.dxc5**

An important move to remember and often the best way of dealing with the pressure against White's centre in such positions.

**8...dxe5**

8...Nxc5 9.Be3 is just too easy for White, with ideas of Bxc5, as well as of Qd2 and O-O-O.

**9.Nxe5**

A more forceful recapture than with the pawn.

**9...Nc6 10.Nxc6**

Probably a simpler way of handling the position than 10.Nc4 Nd4 .

**10...bxc6 11.Be3**

White's position may look a little overextended, but there is an extra pawn and a lead in development! Moreover, White is ready to castle and Black's attempt to activate can be dealt with straightforwardly enough: 11...Rb8 12.Na4 Rb4!? 13.Nb6! 13...Rxb2? 14.Bd4 13...Bxb2 14.Rb1 Tempting though it may be to sacrifice the exchange for the dark squares, there's just no need to. 14...Bc3+ 15.Kf2 Rxb1 16.Qxb1 This has all been fairly forced and at first you might wonder why White has returned the extra pawn so. Well, apart from the king which is pretty safe on f2, the grip supplied by the pawn on c5 , and the knight on b6 is a mighty one. Clearly Black doesn't want to exchange on b6 and see a huge pawn appear there, but he is going to come under some pressure in any case after Rd1. For example: 16...O-O 17.Rd1 e5! 18.Nxc8! exf4!, 18...Qxc8 19.Bg4 is rather awkward, and if 19...f5 20.Qb3+, 19.Bxf4 Qf6 20.g3 Nxc5 21.Nd6 Returning the extra piece with 21.Qb6!? Ne4+ 22.Kg2 Rxc8 23.Bxa6 is also quite tempting. 21...g5 22.Qb6 Na4 23.Qe3 gxf4 24.gxf4 Black has just reeled of a string of computer only moves, but remains clearly worse, with Ne4 a semi-threat and a6 potentially vulnerable, not to mention f7 or the king on g8.<level start="18...Qxc8"/><level start="19...f5"/><level start="21.Qb6"/>

**9.Nxe5**

**9...Nxe5**

If 9...Qa5 then 10.Nc4! Qxc5 11.Be3 when White's lead in development is the key feature of the position and Black can easily quickly lose material, as shown by 11...Qc7? 12.Nd5! Qc6 13.Ndb6 Nxb6 14.Nxb6

**10.Qxd8+ Kxd8 11.fxe5 Bxe5 12.Nd5**

which will take advantage of the main downside to ...a6.

**5.e5 Nfd7 6.f4 Bg7 7.Nf3**

**7...O-O**

rather asks for it:

**8.h4 c5 9.h5 cxd4 10.Qxd4**

Yes, the queen is a target in the middle of the board, but, more importantly, she is about to be transferred to the h-file via f2 or even g1:10...dxe5 11.Qf2 Heading for h4.11...exf4 12.hxg6 fxg6 13.Qh4 Nf6 14.Bxf4 Taking stock, we find White a pawn down, but with excellent compensation in the shape of very definite attacking chances and a handy lead in development, with Rd1 and Nd5 the immediate threat.

### (42) Pirc Introduction - Pirc 5.e5 #4 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4**

**2...Nf6 3.Nc3**

**3...g6 4.Be2**

**4...a6**

**5.e5 dxe5 6.dxe5 Qxd1+ 7.Bxd1**

would be a safety-first option for Black, but is also quite sub-optimal for him:

**7...Nfd7 8.Nd5 Kd8 9.Nf3**

Thanks to the presence of a pawn on a6, Black had no choice to defend c7, but to slide his king to d8 and clearly cannot be happy with his position: a disruptive e5-e6 is very much an idea; Bf4 and Ng5 another.

### (43) Pirc A1: 5...O-O - A1: 5...O-O #1 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 O-O**

Fearless or foolhardy? In any case, White should welcome this and the chance to press straight ahead.

**6.h5 gxh5**

A rather ugly move, if not so uncommon for the early chess computers. A human opponent will likely prefer something else, however. Neither does the other central counterstrike trouble White: 6...e5 7.hxg6 fxg6?, 7...hxg6 8.Be3 is very easy for White to play, with Qd2 and O-O-O on their way, but Black probably has to try this. 8.dxe5! . We may want to attack, but shouldn't pass over a strong, simple solution to any position. 8...dxe5 9.Bc4+ Driving the black king into the corner. 9...Kh8 10.Qxd8 Rxd8 11.Nf3 . This was already tremendous for White in Forcen Esteban-Garcia Lopez, Zaragoza 2011, with Black unable to prevent both Nxe5 and Ng5.<level start="7...hxg6"/>

**7.Bxh5**

Simple chess. If Black now does little, White may simply retreat the bishop to f3 or e2 then either push the g-pawn or just go Bh6 and Qd2.

**7...Nc6 8.Be3 e5 9.d5**

Keeping lines closed as here an exchange of queens wouldn't lead to more than a pleasant advantage and having realised that there's no need to fear an invasion by the black knight.

**9...Nd4 10.Nge2**

Just as in certain lines of the King's Indian, White should never want to go 10.Bxd4 exd4? when e4 must collapse in view of 11.Qxd4? Nxh5. Instead, he threatens Nxd4, as well as Ng3, clamping down on Black's weakened light squares.<level/>

10...Nxh5 11.Nxd4 exd4? 12.Qxh5 h6 13.Bxh6 A big pawn to remove and already pretty much a decisive blow. 13...Qf6 Of course, 13...dxc3?? 14.Bxg7 forces mate 14.Bxg7 Qxg7 15.Ne2 Bg4 16.Qh4 Bxe2 17.Kxe2 follows the game Kasparov-'Comp Fidelity Playmatic', Hamburg (simul) 1985, where only White was attacking and with both an extra pawn and the large threat of Rh3. After 11...Nf4!? 12.Nf5! Bxf5 13.exf5 White's structure is a slight mess, but his knight can come to e4 and, even more importantly, Qf3 and g3 is threatened, while Black can't really gobble g2:13...Nxg2+ 14.Kd2! Nxe3 15.Qh5! h6 16.Rag1 Both Qxh6 and Rxg7+ are big threats and even desperadoing the knight won't save Black: 16...Nxf5 17.Qxf5 Kh8 18.Ne4 followed by Nf6! or 18...f6 19.Rxg7! Kxg7 20.Qg4+ Kf7 21.Rxh6 Ke8 22.Rh7 when Black must resign. Even Black's better options, such as 11...Ng3 leave him in huge trouble after 12.fxg3 exd4 13.Qh5 h6 14.Bxh6 Qf6 15.Ne2 10...c5!? would be King's Indianesque, but here White doesn't have to capture en passant: 11.Ng3! This eyes the hole on f5, overprotects the bishop on h5 and may simply be followed by Bg5 and Qd2 or 11...Qb6 12.Qc1 Note, too, one further idea for White here: Nd1 (or just Nce2) (and c3 to drive away the knight from d4, after which White might untangle with f3 and Nf2.)<level start="13...dxc3"/>

### (44) Pirc A1: 5...O-O - A1: 5...O-O #2 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 O-O**

**6.h5 c5**

is one of Black's better defences when played a move earlier, but here White can do even better than seize some central space:

**7.hxg6 fxg6 8.dxc5**

Simple chess from White and now Black can either aim for some slightly desperate-looking counterplay or recapture and suffer:

**8...Qa5**

Or 8...dxc5 when 9.Bd2 isn't so effective as here Black does have 9...Nc6 10.Qc1 Nd4 , but White can simply improve the pieces: 9.Qxd8! Rxd8 10.Be3 . It transpires that c5 is from easy to defend, with O-O-O its way or yet another hit down the h1-a8 diagonal: 10...b6? 11.e5! Nd5 12.O-O-O e6 13.Bg5 . Already the defense of d5 is overloaded in view of 13...Rd7 14.Bg4 Nc7 15.Bf3! .

**9.cxd6 exd6 10.Bd2**

Eve@ stronger than the 10.Nf3!? Nxe4 11.Qd5+ of Smejkal-Boehnisch, Sinaia 1965. ��StartFEN��rnb2rk1/pp4bp/3p1np1/q7/4P3/2N5/PPPBBPP1/R2QK1NR b KQ - 1 10��EndFEN�� 10...Qb6 11.Nf3 is also excellent for White, not least with b2 taboo: 11...Qxb2? 12.Rb1 Qa3 13.Nb5

### (45) Pirc A1: 5...O-O - A1: 5...O-O #3 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 O-O**

**6.h5 c5**

**7.hxg6 hxg6**

can be met by either 8.d5 followed by a rapid Bh6 or a simple central exchange:

**8.dxc5 dxc5 9.Bd2 Nc6 10.Qc1**

This may look a little crude, but the threat of Bh6 is a big one and Black simply lacks counterplay, as shown by

**10...Nd4 11.Bh6**

when the bishop is overprotected, so there's not even a deflection tactic on c2 to think about.

### (46) Pirc A1: 5...O-O - A1: 5...O-O #4 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 O-O**

**6.h5 c5**

**7.hxg6 hxg6**

**8.dxc5 Qa5**

was preferred back in Mestrovic-Matulovic, Sarajevo 1969, but would have left Black in serious trouble had White gone for the route one approach:

**9.Bh6 Bxh6 10.Rxh6 Qxc5 11.Qd2**

The simple threat is Rh1 and Qh6 and even exchanging a pair of rooks shouldn't save Black:

**11...Kg7 12.Rh1 Rh8 13.Rxh8 Kxh8 14.Qh6+ Kg8 15.O-O-O**

sees White's pieces flow to good squares and while he cannot force mate, he can hardly be unhappy: 15...Nc6 16.Nh3 Bxh3 17.Rh1! Qd4 18.Qxh3 Ne8 19.f4 Nd5 is one idea in the position, f4-f5 another and White undoubtedly enjoys a very strong attack.

### (47) Pirc A1: 5...O-O - A1: 5...O-O #5 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 O-O**

**6.h5 Nbd7 7.Be3 c5**

also looks rather slow for Black. True, he isn't about to be dismantled by an exchange on c5, but White can simply go 8.Qd2 or try something even more direct on the kingside:

**8.hxg6 fxg6**

8...hxg6 would require nerves of steel, but is probably a better try, even if 9.Qd2 cxd4 10.Bxd4 Qa5 11.O-O-O does look like a rather promising version of a Dragon for White, with Kb1 and g4 likely to be next up.

**9.Nh3**

9.dxc5 is also pretty effective, and if 9...Nxc5 10.e5! .

**9...a6 10.Bc4+ Kh8 11.Ng5 Qb6 12.Nd5**

Already Black should really have resigned in Ginzburg-Friedheim, Villa Ballester 2001.

### (48) Pirc A2: 5...h6 - A2: 5...h6 #1 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 h6**

This is viable against an early h4 in some lines of the Modern and Pirc and has even been used by Mamedyarov and Hillarp Persson, but it just doesn't quite cut the mustard here, as White can simply press ahead regardless.

**6.h5**

Ploughing straight ahead is even stronger than simple development with Be3 followed by Qd2 when Black may struggle to safely house his king.

**6...g5**

Naturally Black has no desire to see his kingside structure weakened by an exchange on h5 or g6, so opts for a Grob-type kingside. The problem is that White isn't out of pawn breaks.

**7.f4**

Smashing open lines.

**7...gxf4**

7...g4? 8.e5 dxe5 9.fxe5 wouldn't exactly be wise for Black.

**8.Bxf4 Nc6**

Trying to hit back against d4 or with the push ...e5.

**9.Nf3**

Probably best, simply continuing to develop whilst fighting for the key d4 and e5-squares. 9.Qd3 was preferred in Br.Thorfinnsson-Hillarp Persson, Akureyri 2019, when Black might have been able to restrict his losses with 9...Nxd4!? 10.Qxd4 e5 .

**9...Bg4**

9...Nd7!? was preferred in Mestrovic-Bajramovic, Zenica 2003, when White cut across Black's ...e5 designs: 10.d5!? Nce5 11.Qd2 Black does have a firm grip on e5, but that's the end of the good news for him. White will castle queenside, with quite some lead in development. One simple plan is Nd4, another to force through g4-g5 after Rg1 and, if needed, Rh4.

**10.d5**

Otherwise Black might be OK, but now he is beaten to the bounce.

**10...Nb8 11.e5**

Blasting straight ahead. 11.Nd2 is also very pleasant for White, as is 11.Nh4 , which was seen in the all-grandmaster clash Rodriguez Vila-Spangenberg, Vicente Lopez 2002, where Black really needed to grovel with 11...Rg8 .

**11...Nfd7**

Easy to criticise, but the pawns appear poisoned:

**12.e6**

Our favourite central breakthrough.

**12...fxe6**

12...Bxc3+ 13.bxc3 fxe6 is the alternative, but here White has at least 14.Qd2 followed by Nd4 or Bxh6 and Qg5.

**13.Nd4 Bxe2 14.Ncxe2**

This strong recapture merely reinforces the view that Black's light squares have completely gone. 14...Nf8 15.dxe6 Qc8 16.Qd3 Play could continue: 16...Nc6 17.O-O Nd8 Black does everything that he possibly can to remove the bridgehead, but in the mean time White has lined up all his pieces to strike. 18.Rae1 Ndxe6 19.Bg3! A deadly and very strong retreat. White is now ready to go 19...-- 20.Nxe6 Nxe6 21.Qg6+ . And 19...Nxd4 20.Nxd4 fails to help Black with Nf5 now a huge threat, preparing to crash through on e7.

### (49) Pirc A2: 5...h6 - A2: 5...h6 #2 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 h6**

**6.h5**

**6...g5**

**7.f4**

**7...gxf4**

**8.Bxf4 Nc6**

**9.Nf3**

**9...Bg4**

**10.d5**

**10...Nb8 11.e5**

**11...dxe5 12.Nxe5 Bxe2 13.Qxe2**

is quite some lead in development followed by O-O-O, and if

**13...Nxd5 14.O-O-O c6 15.Qg4 Bf6 16.Rhe1**

with a massacre in prospect after Ne4.

### (50) Pirc A2: 5...h6 - A2: 5...h6 #3 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 h6**

**6.h5**

**6...g5**

**7.f4**

**7...gxf4**

**8.Bxf4 Nc6**

**9.Nf3**

**9...Bg4**

**10.d5**

**10...Nb8 11.e5**

**11...Nxh5 12.Bh2**

is a calm, but very strong retreat. White simply threatens to move his knight from f3 and win material down the d1-h5 diagonal:

**12...dxe5 13.Nxe5 Bxe2 14.Qxe2 Nf6**

This saves the black knight, but his position remains a wreck:

**15.O-O-O**

White has much the safer king and far, far too much for the pawn. He might increase the pressure with Ne4 or Nc4 and d6, not to mention g4 and one other key motif:

**15...Nbd7 16.Nc6 \***

### (51) Pirc A2: 5...h6 - A2: 5...h6 #4 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 h6**

**6.h5**

**6...g5**

**7.f4**

**7...gxf4**

**8.Bxf4 Nc6**

**9.Nf3**

**9...Bg4**

**10.d5 e5**

is preferred by the engines, but here 11.Be3 followed by Nd2 looks very pleasant for White and he might even prefer to force the pace:

**11.dxc6 exf4 12.cxb7 Rb8 13.e5**

Suddenly lines are opening faster than Black would wish. He needs to avoid a fork on c6, but even after 13...Nd7!? 13...Nxh5 14.Nd4 Bxe2 15.Qxe2 Ng3 is not to be feared due to 16.Qb5+ Qd7 17.Nc6! 14.Nd4! Black appears to be in serious trouble. 14...Nxe5 15.Bxg4 Nxg4 16.Nc6 and White wins material.

### (52) Pirc A2: 5...h6 - A2: 5...h6 #5 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 h6**

**6.h5**

**6...g5**

**7.f4**

**7...gxf4**

**8.Bxf4 d5**

was frankly a strange choice from a strong player in Nikolovski-Enchev, Skopje 2016, but possibly Black panicked at realising how matters had already gone wrong. Had White gone

**9.e5**

he would just have been doing very well:

**9...Ne4 10.Qd3 Bf5**

Or 10...Nxc3 11.bxc3 c5 12.Qg3 with an active and attractive set-up for White and Nf3 and O-O on the way.

**11.Nxe4 Bxe4 12.Qg3**

Once again, White can ask immediate and challenging questions of the black kingside.

**12...Kf8**

12...Rg8? misses a simple tactic: 13.Bxh6

**13.O-O-O**

White may even be able to go Rh4-g4 and can always challenge Black's one good piece with Bd3.

### (53) Pirc A3: 5...c6 - A3: 5...c6 #1 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 c6**

A very common move in the Pirc, if here one which White should most certainly welcome.

**6.h5**

Needless to say, we press straight ahead.

**6...b5**

Thematic enough and the kingside alternatives hardly look especially healthy either for Black:

**7.h6**

AlphaZero-like play, seizing as much space as possible to cramp Black, although if you prefer to maintain the tension, there's absolutely nothing wrong with 7.a3 followed by completing development as White.

**7...Bf8**

Here White made a decent case for 8.a3 in the all-GM clash Campora-Spraggett, Santo Antonio 2002, but with Black behind in development we prefer a new idea and to strike without delay:

**8.e5 dxe5 9.dxe5 Qxd1+ 10.Bxd1**

Once again, this recapture is the one which disrupts White's position the least.

**10...Nd5 11.Nge2**

By no means White's only good move, but arguably simplest. White threatens Nxd5 cxd5 and Nc3, while keeping his options open. All of Ne4, Nd4 and a4 will leave Black under pressure and he still has to solve the problem of his bishop on f8, which is far from easy to do. For example: 11...Nxc3 12.Nxc3 Nd7 13.e6! Or simply 13.f4 13...fxe6 14.Bf3 Ne5 15.Be4 Suddenly both Bf4 and Nxb5 are large threats and Black is just in serious trouble. And if 11...a6 12.a4 b4 13.Ne4 Bf5 14.Ng5 when Nd4 is next up, ...e6 would trap Black's bishop on the wrong side of the pawn chain, and 14...f6!? 15.Nf3 Bg4 16.Nf4! Both to maintain control and to keep up the pressure.

### (54) Pirc A3: 5...c6 - A3: 5...c6 #2 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 c6**

**6.h5**

**6...b5**

**7.h6**

**7...Bf8**

**8.e5 dxe5 9.dxe5 Qxd1+ 10.Bxd1**

**10...b4**

is again possible too, but here White might very much consider Na4-c5, as well as just exchanging - with a twist:

**11.exf6 bxc3 12.Ne2**

White simply wants to go Nxc3, Be3, Bf3 and O-O-O or to cause trouble down the long diagonal: 12...cxb2 13.Bxb2 exf6 14.Bxf6 Rg8 15.c3!? This rules out any awkward check and leaves White with the much easier position to play. Nf4 (or Nd4) and Bf3 (or Ba4) is next up, while O-O (or even O-O-O) is likely to be pretty strong, threatening a rather disruptive check on the e-file.

### (55) Pirc A3: 5...c6 - A3: 5...c6 #3 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 c6**

**6.h5**

**6...b5**

**7.h6**

**7...Bf8**

**8.e5**

Black might prefer to retain the tension, but doing so only encourages one of White's favourite breakthroughs:

**8...Nfd7 9.e6 fxe6 10.Nf3**

This isn't immediately winning, but looks very nice for White. His knight will settle on g5, the bishop may come to f3 and it's even possible to further weaken Black's queenside with a2-a4. Moreover, and most importantly, how will that bishop ever get out from f8? As such, Black might try to break out: 10...e5 11.dxe5 Nxe5 11...dxe5? 12.Ng5 is pretty much just winning 12.Nxe5 dxe5 Here White has a few tempting options, but simplest and strongest is a thematic strike to exploit the manner in which Black has weakened himself on the h1-a8 diagonal: 13.Qxd8+ Kxd8 14.Nxb5!

### (56) Pirc A3: 5...c6 - A3: 5...c6 #4 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 c6**

**6.h5**

**6...b5**

**7.h6**

**7...Bf8**

**8.e5 b4 9.exf6 bxc3 10.fxe7 Bxe7 11.bxc3**

White is a pawn to the good, Black should have long-term issues with his king position and White's king will be quite safe on g1 or even f1. For example: 11...O-O 12.Nf3 Bf5 13.O-O completing development with simple means 13...Nd7 14.Re1 Re8 15.c4 Bf6 16.Bf4 White isn't able to strike on the a1-h8 diagonal, but should be very happy. Qd2 will complete development, after which White will combine central play with exploiting the presence of a certain fish bone on h6. Note that while Black might bring his knight round to e6, doing so may lead to problems for his bishop on f5 after Nh2, which in any case is not a bad manoeuvre, preparing to send the knight closer f6 or possibly regroup with Nf1-e3.

### (57) Pirc A3: 5...c6 - A3: 5...c6 #5 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 c6**

**6.h5 Nxh5 7.Bxh5 gxh5**

has been tried by a couple of IMs, but after

**8.Nge2**

we doubt they would have been feeling too happy. White simply wants to complete development with Be3 and Nf4/g3, aiming to land the knight on h5, while ...Bg4 is never really an issue on account of f3. Black's other attempt to disrupt also seems to come up short:

**8...Qb6 9.a4 Qa5 10.Bd2**

10...Nd7 and here White can just go 11.f3 or even 11.Nd5!? Qd8 12.Ne3 Nf6 13.Ng3 Both knights are on the kingside and after Bc3, White will finally regain his pawn with interest after Nxh5.

### (58) Pirc A3: 5...c6 - A3: 5...c6 #6 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 c6**

**6.h5 gxh5**

is not only ugly, but fails to convince. Here 7.f4 is tempting, 7.Bxh5 can hardly be bad, of course, and there's also

**7.Nh3 Nbd7 8.Nf4 Qb6 9.a4**

once again makes good sense to tickle the black queen 9.a3 also turned out well in Sharafiev-Kupreichik, Kazan 2006, which we'll see below, although there is a slight difference with the line we saw after 6...Nxh5

**9...a5 10.Qd3**

Without a knight on e2, 10.Be3? can be met by 10...Qxb2 , although White might wish to consider 10.Ra3!? .

**10...Ng4 11.Bxg4 hxg4 12.Be3**

Once again, with the knight on c3 now overprotected, b2 is taboo: 12...Qxb2? It's actually far from easy to find a good move for Black: 12...Nf6? 13.e5 is not it, and 12...Rb8 13.Nh5 Bf8 14.e5! also crashes through. Just enjoy the strength of White's initiative after 14...dxe5 15.dxe5 Qc7 16.e6! fxe6 17.O-O-O . One side is fully developed and coordinated, the other... Moreover, Nf4 and Ne4-g5 are two simple and very serious threats which Black will struggle to deal with. 13.Rb1 Qa3 Now 14.Rb3 can be met by 14...Qa1+ , but there's more than one way to skin this cat: 14.Bc1!

### (59) Pirc A3: 5...c6 - A3: 5...c6 #7 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 c6**

**6.h5 gxh5**

**7.Nh3 e5**

prevents Nf4, but only at some cost in terms of time to the black king, since White should be happy to hoover:

**8.dxe5 dxe5 9.Qxd8+ Kxd8**

He can then exploit the weakness of f7 to activate before keeping a lid on any counterplay:

**10.Ng5 Ke8 11.Bc4 Rf8 12.a4**

Thi@ rules out ...b5 and looks rather pleasant for White. He is a doubled-pawn in arrears, but Black's position is a mess. One plan is the simple Be3 (threatening Bc5), f3, Ne2 and Ng3; another Nf3-h4, f3 and Nd1-e3, aiming to invade with some effect on f5.

### (60) Pirc A3: 5...c6 - A3: 5...c6 #8 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 c6**

**6.h5**

**6...Rg8**

is also rather sub-optimal for Black. He frees a square for his bishop, but 7.h6 Bh8 8.Nf3 and Ng5 still looks pretty good for White, as does simple development:

**7.hxg6 hxg6 8.Nf3 Qa5 9.Bd2 Qb6**

This was Galego-Schou Moldt, Reykjavik 2014, where White prepared Be3 with 10.a3, but once again we prefer

**10.a4**

White seizes further space and may also eye f7:

**10...a5**

By now you should know the drill against 10...Qxb2? , although you likely did already: 11.Rb1 Qa3 12.Rb3 .

**11.Bc4 Nbd7 12.Qe2**

Despite the presence of a pawn on a4, White can safely castle queenside as Black isn't about to attack. Moreover, Ng5 and f4 is now on its way, as well as simple crashing straight through with e4-e5 and, yes, b2 is still taboo: 12...Qxb2? 13.Rb1 Qxc2 14.Bb3 and once again the black queen has been trapped.

### (61) Pirc A4: 5...Nc6 - A4: 5...Nc6 #1 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 Nc6**

Black's third most popular move and one which has attracted a number of grandmaster adherents, albeit mainly back in the eighties. As so often in the Pirc, 6.d5 Ne5 risks overextension for White and will lead to decent counter-chances for Black, while here one common response in general to ...Nc6, namely 6.Bb5 , would, of course, cost White a tempo.

**6.h5**

We refuse to be intimidated and press ahead. White has scored 61% with this logical advance on the database, where, to our surprise, it's been fractionally less popular than 6.Be3 .

**6...gxh5**

This slightly ugly capture is one of the main ideas behind 5...Nc6.

**7.Nh3**

Whi@e has tried a whole host of moves here. We've elected to go with a logical and pretty thematic move for the whole 4.Be2 and 5.h4 variation in the attempt to bring the king's knight to f4. Of the alternatives, 7.Bxh5? clearly isn't wise with d4 weak, but all of 7.Be3 , 7.Bg5 (the f6-knight will now be pinned after ...e5 ), and 7.f4!? have plenty going for them.

**7...e5**

Preventing Nf4 so must be critical.

**8.dxe5**

It's back to plan A, the simple and straightforward exchange, as here White has nothing too amazing after 8.d5 Nd4 followed by ...c6 or ...c5.

**8...dxe5**

This must be critical.

**9.Qxd8+ Nxd8 10.Nb5**

Fighting for the initiative rather than allow Black to cover his main central weaknesses with 10.Bg5 c6! .

**10...Bxh3**

Giving up the bishop-pair, but at least this way Black can cover c7 and obtain some play on the dark squares.

**11.Rxh3 Ne6 12.Bc4**

White is happy to leave Black with a sickly extra pawn on h5 and instead wants to both maintain the initiative and weaken further the black structure.

**12...Kd7 13.Bxe6+**

As well as forcing the pace so, a pretty good case can be made for the calm 13.Be3 , but 13.Rd3+ would only have supplied an edge in Nisipeanu-Itkis, Romania 1995, had Black found 13...Ke7! .

**13...fxe6 14.Rc3**

An unexpected, but strong attack. Black has no especially good way of dealing with the threat and is just somewhat worse. The tactics favour White after 14...Rhc8 15.Be3 Nxe4 16.Rd1+ Ke7 17.Rc4! Nf6 18.Nxa7 14...Ne8? 15.Bg5 followed by Rd1+ 14...c6 15.Rd3+ Kc8 or 15...Ke7 16.Nd6 followed by Nxb7 or just Bg5 and Rad1.16.Nd6+ Kc7 17.Bg5 Black has retained his extra pawn, but remains structurally worse with two sets of doubled pawns. No less importantly, he continues to lack counterplay, while O-O-O will merely serve to augment White's bind on the position.

### (62) Pirc A4: 5...Nc6 - A4: 5...Nc6 #2 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 Nc6**

**6.h5**

**6...gxh5**

**7.Nh3**

**7...e5**

**8.dxe5**

**8...dxe5**

**9.Qxd8+ Nxd8 10.Nb5**

**10...Bxh3**

**11.Rxh3 Ne6 12.Bc4**

**12...a6 13.Bxe6 axb5 14.Bf5**

isn't completely ridiculous for Black, but does leave White's light-squared bishop on fine post. Nisipeanu and Stoica thought that White was slightly better after

**14...O-O**

then 15.Bd2 , and here

**15.Rc3 c6 16.Rg3**

might be even stronger. Black can no longer so easily deploy his queen's rook via a6 and b2-b3 will also keep it out of a4. After b3 and Bb2 White should have a pleasant edge thanks to his two powerful bishops and may look to deploy both rooks to the d-file or to attack on the kingside after, say, Rh1, Rh3 and f4.

However, even here White can force the pace and maintain an edge:

**13.Bxe6 fxe6 14.Nxc7+ Kf7 15.Nb5**

followed by Nc3, Be3, Ke2 and f3 or if

**15...Nxe4 16.Nxa7**

when Black actually doesn't really have any threats, just much the worse structure.

merely gives White a powerful initiative because Black can't give up the rook and trap the knight on a8:

**11...Nxg5 12.Nxc7+ Kd8 13.Nxa8 Ngxe4 14.Be3**

The knight will either escape after Bxa7 or be sacrificed to give White a deadly attack: 14...b6 15.O-O-O+ Bd7 16.Rh4! Even stronger than 16.Ba6 . 16...Kc8? 17.Ba6+ Kb8 18.Rxe4! The point of White's play. 18...Nxe4 19.Rxd7 Kxa8 20.Bb7+ Kb8 21.Bxe4 and wins.

**7...e5**

**8.dxe5**

**8...Nxe5**

is just very pleasant for White, at least so long as he avoids 9.Nf4 h4! 10.Rxh4? Nxe4 . Instead, 9.f3 is sensible or just

**9.Be3**

not rushing to regain the pawn and simply intending Qd2 and O-O-O. Black can try to disrupt, but without really causing any disruption:

**9...Neg4**

9...Be6 10.Nf4 Neg4 11.Nxh5 is a timely regaining of the pawn, and if 11...Nxh5 12.Bxg4 and even 9...Ng6 10.Nf4 h4 11.Qd2 is very pleasant for White with Black struggling to complete development and find a safe home for his king in view of 11...Bd7 12.O-O-O Qe7? 13.Ncd5 .

**10.Bg5 h6 11.Bh4**

after which Nf4 will carry a certain threat.

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 Nc6**

**6.h5**

**6...gxh5**

**7.Nh3**

**7...Bxh3 8.Rxh3**

is the other way of doing so, but White can hardly object to acquiring both the bishop-pair and an active rook at such an early stage. Black's king probably wants to head eastwards to the queenside, but even there it may not be so safe:

**8...Qd7 9.Be3**

A very good case can also be made for the preparatory 9.f3.

**9...Ng4**

9...e5 is unusually less critical because here White can simply grab: 10.d5 Nd4 11.Bxd4! exd4 12.Qxd4 Kf8 . This was Lieb-Chandler, German Bundesliga 1980, where White, prudently enough, retreated the queen to d2, but 13.Qb4 was also very possible, as was 13.O-O-O !? Ng4 14.Qd2 , since the f-pawn is taboo: 14...Nxf2? 15.Bb5 .

**10.Rxh5 Nxe3 11.fxe3**

White's pawns are doubled, but d4 is secure and Qd2, O-O-O and Rdh1 is on the way, if not Bb5, Qf3 and O-O-O. 11...O-O-O? Or 11...a6 12.Qd3 O-O-O , which can just be met by 13.O-O-O , but also most tempting is 13.Rb1!? simply intending to roll the b-pawn and exploit Black's lack of counterplay to launch a strong attack. 12.Bb5! a6 Here White can do even better than 13.Ba4 , since he can exploit the potentially loose bishop on g7 (Do you know John Nunn's handy mnemonic LPDO? - loose pieces drop off!) : 13.Bxc6 Qxc6? 14.Qg4+

### (67) Pirc A4: 5...Nc6 - A4: 5...Nc6 #7 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 Nc6**

**6.h5**

Not for the first time,

**6...Nxh5 7.Bxh5 gxh5**

also creates quite an unaesthetic impression. Here 8.Nge2 is thematic and good, but

**8.Be3**

is also rather tempting. White falls in with Black's plans, as it were, but is ready with a certain sting in the tail:

**8...e5**

Not forced, of course, but otherwise White will capture on h5 and develop with an attractive set-up: for example, 8...e6 9.Rxh5 Qe7 10.Qd2 Bd7 was Todorovic-Savicevic, Ulcinj 1997, where White went 11.Nf3 , but 11.Nge2 is likely slightly more accurate. The point becomes clear after 11...O-O-O 12.O-O-O Rdg8 13.Rdh1 h6 when 14.R5h2!? and Ng3 is one idea, the simple 14.g3 Qf6 15.R5h4 another, after which White is set to go Nf4-h5 and it's hard to imagine the h6-pawn will survive for too long.

**9.d5**

Refusing to fear the arrival of Black's knight on d4, although we should point out too that 9.Nge2 did lead to an edge for White in Romero Holmes-Nijboer, Groningen 1984.

**9...Nd4**

Consistent. 9...Ne7?! 10.Qxh5 Ng6 11.Nge2 would just leave Black with a weakened kingside and White set to go O-O-O followed by Ng3-f5.

**10.Nb1**

This startling retreat is the point of White's play. Black can save his knight, but only by making concessions:

**10...c6 11.c3**

All@wing the knight to live, but unfortunately White is short of a good move after 11.a4? Qb6 . ��StartFEN��r1bqk2r/pp3pbp/2pp4/3Pp2p/3nP3/2P1B3/PP3PP1/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 11��EndFEN�� 11...Nb5 12.dxc6 Further discombobulation of Black's pawns. 12...bxc6 13.Qxh5 A sample continuation would be: 13...Be6 14.Nd2 Qd7 15.Ngf3 Taking stock after two fairly obvious developing knight moves from White, we find a slightly modern or should we even say computery position. However, what really counts is White's much safer king position (the king is currently fine on e1, but will likely be safely housed on g1 at some stage) . A timely a2-a4 will drive Black's knight back and meanwhile there are definite ideas of Ng5, as well as of Qh4, Bg5 and Bf6 to weaken Black somewhat on the dark squares.

### (68) Pirc A4: 5...Nc6 - A4: 5...Nc6 #8 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 Nc6**

**6.h5**

Bearing in mind what we've just seen after 6...Nxh5, you might wonder about an immediate central counterstrike from Black:

**6...e5**

However, it's too early for this in part because the h-pawn can again make a right nuisance of itself:

**7.h6 Bf8**

Now there are too good approaches, depending on your taste. The simple path is 8.dxe5 , and if 8...dxe5 9.Qxd8+ Nxd8 10.Bg5 followed by Nf3, Bc4 and likely O-O-O, with somewhat the easier development for White. The slightly more complex path involves keeping pieces on:

**8.Nf3 exd4**

8...Bg4?! 9.dxe5! is certainly now well-timed: 9...dxe5 9...Bxf3? 10.exf6! Bxe2 11.Qxe2 Qxf6 does not help Black to free his cramped position through exchanges, but rather leaves him under heavy pressure: 12.Nd5 Qd8 13.Qb5! Rb8 14.Bg5! . Already Black pretty much has to resign in view of 14...Qxg5 15.Nxc7+ . 10.Qxd8+ Rxd8 11.Bg5 Seizing the initiative and preparing to invade on the weakest square in Black's camp, d5.11...Be7 12.Bxf6! Bxf6 13.Nd5 . We've followed some old analysis by Malaniuk, which he unsurprisingly assessed as clearly better for White, since c7 is falling with check.

**9.Nxd4 Be7 10.Be3**

Straightforward development, although a good case can also be made for placing the bishop on f4 or g5.

**10...O-O 11.Qd2 a6**

It's not hard to appreciate why Black was likely reticent about bringing the white queen closer to g7:11...Nxd4 12.Qxd4 c6 13.O-O-O Be6 14.f4! . Once again, White enjoys an attractive attacking set-up with f4-f5 set to rip open lines.

**12.Nxc6**

12.O-O-O is also good, but there's no need to fear the half-open b-file and now ...Ne5 or ...Nxd4 never need be taken into account.

**12...bxc6 13.O-O-O**

We've followed the encounter Malaniuk-Guseinov, Kiev 1984, where White enjoyed a lovely set-up, with his f- and g-pawns set to cause havoc, not to mention that advanced, deadly fish bone wedged on h6 in the black king's throat. Play continued thematically with 13...a5 14.f3 Be6 15.g4 Qc8 16.g5! Nd7 17.f4! With the simple idea of Rdf1 and f4-f5 17...f6 18.Rdf1 Qd8 19.Bd4! and Black remains under extremely heavy pressure, with f4-f5 set to rip open lines, as would have been the case after 19...fxg5? 20.f5 Bf7 21.fxg6 Bxg6 22.Bc4+ with a winning attack, for instance: 22...Bf7 23.Rxf7 Rxf7 24.Rf1 d5 25.Rxf7 Kxf7 26.exd5

### (69) Pirc A5: 5...c5 - A5: 5...c5 #1 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 c5**

Black strives for immediate counterplay and it's no surprise that this is one of his two main options. It's been the choice of Grischuk, Kramnik and Svidler at blitz, as well as of leading Pirc exponents Azmaiparashvili, Mikhail Gurevich, Hodgson and Marin in longplay games.

**6.dxc5**

Not for the first time we meet a central counter with an immediate exchange, as well as one which maintains a fair degree of control and supplies definite chances to emerge with the upper hand. Instead, 6.h5? no longer makes sense when 6...cxd4 is on and 6.e5 dxe5 7.dxe5 Qxd1+ 8.Bxd1 Ng4 seems to be fine for Black. However, 6.d5!? is a very respectable alternative if you don't mind a Schmidt Benoni structure. The critical line to explore there is probably 6...O-O 7.h5 b5!? .

**6...Qa5**

Pinning so is a very typical device in such positions. 6...dxc5? 7.Qxd8+ Kxd8 8.Be3 just makes no sense for Black. Not only is the c5-pawn rather vulnerable, but its advance has weakened some key squares and just what is the black king doing on d8? White will quickly go O-O-O and perhaps even Nb5 or e4-e5 and Nd5.

**7.Bd2**

Simple chess. 7.cxd6 Nxe4 gives Black too much counterplay, although 7.Kf1!? can't be ridiculous in conjunction with the early h4 . Notably the American GM Alex Sherzer once denoted our pin-breaking choice as dubious, an assessment with which we, Stockfish and Lc0 would like to disagree. Like Joel Benjamin, Sherzer himself has preferred 7.Qd3 when 7...Qxc5 8.Be3 Qa5 can be met by 9.Qb5+ , but this shouldn't lead to any advantage for White. Instead, we simply break the pin with a choice described back in 2003 by Joe Gallagher in 'Starting Out: The Pirc/Modern', as 'less common, but more testing for Black'. Notably too the modest bishop development went unnoticed by Chernin and Alburt in their 2001 book 'Pirc Alert!'.

**7...Qxc5**

7...dxc5? still rather misses the point. White can just go 8.h5 or begin to squash Black with 8.e5 Nfd7 9.f4 .

**8.h5**

Being able to press ahead so is partly why we like the seemingly modest 7.Bd2 . 8.Be3 Qa5 9.Qd2 isn't ridiculous, but can this really be such a bad version of the Dragon for Black after 9...Nc6?

**8...gxh5**

This structure-splitting choice has been Black's most popular option by some margin, played by a number of quite strong players and was analysed in James Vigus's seminal work 'The Pirc in Black and White' back in 2007.

**9.Nh3**

White continues to ignore the pawn on h5 for now. The aim is once again Nf4, although if you don't mind Dragon-type positions, 9.Be3 Qa5 10.Qd2 can also be explored.

**9...Nc6**

Black's main move, continuing to develop along typical lines.

**10.Nf4**

Centralising the knight and now White has ideas of not just Nxh5, but also Ncd5, looking to seize the initiative.

**10...Bg4**

Try@ng to disrupt on the kingside. 10...O-O? 11.Nxh5 Nxh5 12.Rxh5 would just spell serious danger for the black king: for example: 12...Qd4 13.Kf1!? Rarely a bad spot for the king in this line and now Bd3 Ne5; Be3 is on with ...Nxd3 not coming with check. 13...Be6 14.Bd3 Ne5 15.Be3 Qb4 16.a3! when Black will either lose material along the fifth rank or lose his queen 16...Qxb2 17.Na4 . ��StartFEN��r1b1k2r/pp2ppbp/2np1n2/2q4p/4PN2/2N5/PPPBBPP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 10��EndFEN�� 10...Bd7 would just be a little passive and also does nothing to disrupt White's designs: 11.Nxh5 Nxh5 12.Rxh5 The active rook may stay where it is or swing to b5, d5 or even g5 at some stage, while the white king will again be quite safe on g1. Black can keep his queen safe, but not easily obtain any counterplay: 12...Qb6 13.Nd5! Qd8 14.Bg5 Not only is Black low on counterplay, but his king is hardly about to leap into the fire and go to g8, and grabbing on b2 only serves to open lines for White: 14...Bxb2 15.Rb1 Bg7 16.Rb3!? 16.Rxb7 was hardly bad, but White spurns the pawn to keep Black tied down and aims to increase the pressure after Rg3. ��StartFEN��r1b1k2r/pp2ppbp/2np1n2/2q4p/4PN2/2N5/PPPBBPP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 10��EndFEN�� 10...Ng4 does disrupt, but also looks like an inferior option compared to the main line for Black: 11.Nd3 Qd4 Here White couldn't resist beginning to activate with 12.Nd5 both Malaniuk-Azmaiparashvili, USSR Championship, Kiev 1986, and Garcia Fernandez-Marin, Cullera 2003, where matters weren't entirely clear after 12...Nce5! , but instead White can finish tidying things up before looking to advance: ��StartFEN��r1b1k2r/pp2ppbp/2np4/7p/3qP1n1/2NN4/PPPBBPP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 6 12��EndFEN�� 12.f3! Ne3? 12...Nf6 13.Nf4 is a better option for Black, but does just leave White in full control. 13.Qc1! Black's knight would now be trapped if it grabbed on g2, but the alternative costs him most of the dark squares: 13...Nxg2+? 14.Kf1 Rg8 saves the knight, but that's not White's only target: 15.Nd5! when not only is Nc7+ a threat, but Bc3 Qc4; Qg5 is also rather difficult for Black to deal with.

**11.f3**

This is now well enough timed. White will always be able to go Be3, if needed, after bringing a knight to d5.

**11...Be6**

If 11...Bd7?! then 12.Ncd5! seizes the initiative. Not only is Nc7+ a threat, but Nd3 may leave the black queen a little short of squares and it's White who is in control of the position: 12...Nd4 13.Bd3 keeps everything secure and, indeed, after, for example, 13...Nxd5 14.Nxd5 e6 15.Bb4 Qc6 16.Ne3 White is clearly for choice: Nc4 is threatened, h5 is falling and White's king will be quite safe on f1 or c1, in contrast to which Black's king may struggle to find a safe home.

**12.a4**

A s@ightly surprising choice perhaps, but White has sufficient central control to be able to seize some space so. Now Black must make sure that his queen doesn't run out of squares after a4-a5 and he is denied the counterplay he was hoping for with 12.Qc1 the only move considered by Vigus and also Tiger Hillarp Persson in 'Tiger's Modern' and 'The Modern Tiger', where he advocated this line against ��StartFEN��rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1��EndFEN�� 1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.h4 , i.e. 4...Nf6 5.Be2 c5 , etc. 12...Nd4 , which intended 13.Be3? Nxc2+! in Rodriguez-Tkachiev, Villa Martelli 1997. ��StartFEN��r3k2r/pp2ppbp/2npbn2/2q4p/P3PN2/2N2P2/1PPBB1P1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 12��EndFEN�� 12...O-O Black finally bites the bullet and castles. 13.Nd3 13.a5!? also deserves attention, but again the knight retreat is a pretty decent choice. 13...Qb6 14.a5 White calmly continues to annex space. 14...Qc7 15.Nf4 Back again, but only with Black's queen now on a somewhat less active post. White takes control of d5 and is also ready to finally capture on h5. He may also delay that in order to first go Be3 and Qd2, the king should be safe enough on e1 or f1 going to the queenside is likely to be too risky with the pawn up on a5, and overall we quite like his attacking chances. ��StartFEN��r3k2r/pp2ppbp/2npbn2/2q4p/P3PN2/2N2P2/1PPBB1P1/R2QK2R b KQkq 0 12��EndFEN�� 12...Qb6? would be rather cumbersome and allows White to seize a strong initiative: 13.a5! Qd8 13...Nxa5? 14.Ncd5 wins material, as does 13...Qxb2 14.Rb1 Qa3 15.Nb5 14.Be3!? Black is still reluctant to castle short, he surely won't find safety for his king on the queenside either and should be very wary about accepting gifts: 14...Nxa5 15.e5! Suddenly White has a crushing initiative in the middle of the board due to that potentially loose knight on a5. Instead Black may try ��StartFEN��r3k2r/pp2ppbp/2npbn2/2q4p/P3PN2/2N2P2/1PPBB1P1/R2QK2R b KQkq 0 12��EndFEN�� 12...Ne5!? but it does allow a check: 13.Bb5+ Bd7 13...Nc6? 14.b4! reminds Black that he must be careful with his queen. She can make it back to base, but only at some cost: 14...Qb6 15.a5 Qd8 16.a6 and Black's queenside is crumbling. 14.Bxd7+ Simple chess, although the immediate 14.Qe2 can also be considered. 14...Nexd7 15.Qe2 White's set-up is a fairly attractive one: Black is again a little low on counterplay, both Be3 and Qb5 are ideas and White may even castle queenside, not least in the event of 15...O-O? 16.g4! which suddenly launches a rather strong attack. ��StartFEN��r3k2r/pp2ppbp/2npbn2/2q4p/P3PN2/2N2P2/1PPBB1P1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 12��EndFEN�� 12...d5!? tries to break free, but White is well placed to maintain sufficient control of the position: 13.Nd3! With tempo and a move which also usefully takes control of e5.13...Qd4 13...Qb6 can be met by 14.a5 or even a strong gain of central space: 14.e5!? Nd7 15.f4 , which just looks like a very promising version of a French for White. White may increase the central pressure with Bf3, with two other important ideas those of a5 and Kf1 - Rxh5 should, though, only occur once ...Qg1+ isn't an issue. 13...Qd6 14.Bf4 Qd8 15.e5 is similar: 15...Nd7 16.Rxh5 . Again the e5-point is secure and White's bridgehead there gives him a pleasant advantage. Qd2 and Kf1 may follow and just where will the black king find safety? 14.Nb5 Forcing Black's next. 14...Qb6 15.e5! Nd7 16.f4 Once again we find White with a pleasant space advantage, whether or not Black drives back the knight from b5.16...a6 17.Nc3 Both a4-a5 and Bf3 should increase the pressure on Black who also faces his usual problem: where to safely house his king. In contrast, White's king should be safe enough on f1. Black might try to break out with ...f6, but 17...O-O 18.Bf3 maintains full control for White, and if 18...d4 or 18...f6 19.Nxd5 Qd8 20.Ne3! , which creates a definite threat: 20...fxe5 21.Bxc6! bxc6 22.Qxh5 h6 23.f5 Bf7 24.Qh4 and Black's king will do very well to survive. 19.Nd5 Qd8 20.Rxh5 f6 21.Qe2 when O-O-O and Rdh1 may even follow.

was preferred by Joe Gallagher, hoping to entice f2-f3 when White won't find it so easy to go Be3. We don't have to be distracted however:

**10.Nf4 Nbd7**

10.@.Nc6 transposes to our main line and now White surprised Black (and not in a good way) by taking on h5 in Sermier-Gallagher, French League 2003, but he might have preferred to improve his pieces first:

**11.Be3 Qa5**

The queen can also go to b4, but 11...Qb4 12.f3 Qxb2? 13.Bd4 is tactically undesirable for him, and 11...Bxe2 12.Qxe2 Qb4 can be met by 13.Nd3 or even 13.O-O-O !? Nxe4 14.Nfd5 Nxc3 15.bxc3 Qa3+ 16.Kb1 when 16...O-O-O is pretty much forced and here 17.Qc4+ Kb8 18.Nxe7 Qxc3 19.Qxc3 Bxc3 20.Nd5 Bg7 21.Rxh5 retains decent compensation for one pawn with White's pieces somewhat the more active and better coordinated.

**12.f3 Be6 13.Qd2**

White's pieces all stand on sensible squares and his king can go to either side. In contrast, Black looks a little cramped and his king is not so happy. Note too that White has immediate positional threats in both Nxe6 fxe6; Bc4 and Nb5, which works even if Black defends well: 13...Rc8 13...a6?! 14.Nxe6 fxe6 15.Bc4 is quite awkward for Black to meet and White will likely castle queenside then attack. 14.Nb5!? Qxd2+ 15.Kxd2 a6 16.Nd4 Intensifying the pressure. 16...Bc4 17.Bxc4 Rxc4 18.Nf5 and White has a pleasant edge with threats against g7 and h5 and he may also be able to construct a useful-enough Maroczy Bind after b2-b3 and c2-c4, leaving Black a little low on counterplay.

Here 11.Bxh5 is very possible and the calm

might be even stronger. The king should be quite safe here as White simply keeps all his options open. One point is that Be3 Qb4 can now be met by Nd5, while White can look to play on either flank with a2-a4 again likely to be an effective gain of space, as well as an advance which may make Black think twice about castling long.

**10.Be3 Qa5 11.Qd2**

White enjoys an excellent version of an Open Sicilian and may even get in f2-f4 and g2-g4-g5 before developing with Nf3 and O-O-O.

### (73) Pirc A5: 5...c5 - A5: 5...c5 #5 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 c5**

can, likewise, be well met by 9.h6 and here another of our favourite ideas is also quite strong.

**9.Nh3 Nbd7 10.Nf4 b5 11.h6**

Finally!

**11...Bf8 12.a4 b4 13.Ncd5**

This already gave White a near decisive initiative in Garcia Fernandez-Wojtkiewicz, Valencia 1990, with both Bxb4 and Be3 set to cause major problems.

**10...Ng4**

does disrupt, but also looks like an inferior option compared to the main line for Black:

**11.Nd3 Qd4**

Here White couldn't resist beginning to activate with 12.Nd5 both Malaniuk-Azmaiparashvili, USSR Championship, Kiev 1986, and Garcia Fernandez-Marin, Cullera 2003, where matters weren't entirely clear after 12...Nce5! , but instead White can finish tidying things up before looking to advance:

**12.f3 Ne3**

12...Nf6 13.Nf4 is a better option for Black, but does just leave White in full control. isn't completely clear after 13.Bxe3 Qxe3 14.Nd5 Qg5 . This should still be quite promising for White, but there is a simpler and even stronger method:

**13.Qc1**

Black's knight would now be trapped if it grabbed on g2, but the alternative costs him most of the dark squares:

**13...Bh6 14.Nd5 Nxg2+ 15.Kd1**

is @he final key move to remember here, and not 15.Kf1? Bxd2 16.Qxd2 Rg8 ��StartFEN��r1b1k2r/pp2pp1p/2np3b/3N3p/3qP3/3N1P2/PPPBB1n1/R1QK3R b kq - 1 15��EndFEN�� 15...Bxd2 16.Qxd2 threatens Qg5, as well as Nc7+, so Black must lose material.

### (75) Pirc A5: 5...c5 - A5: 5...c5 #7

**6.dxc5**

**6...Qa5**

**7.Bd2**

**7...Qxc5**

**8.h5**

**8...Nxh5**

is much weaker and not just because of 9.Bxh5 gxh5 10.Rxh5 , but something even more vigorous:

**9.Nd5**

Threatening Bb4

**9...Be6 10.Bb4 Qc8 11.Nxe7**

White regains his pawn with a clear advantage and will maintain the initiative: 11...Qd7 11...Kxe7? 12.Qxd6+ Kf6 avoids the immediate mate, but Black will shortly be mated after 13.Nf3 12.Qxd6 Qxd6 13.Bxd6 Bxb2 maintains material equality, but only one king is in serious trouble after 14.Rb1 Bc3+ 15.Kf1 followed by Rxb7 or Nd5.

### (76) Pirc A5: 5...c5 - A5: 5...c5 #8 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 c5**

**6.dxc5**

**6...Qa5**

**7.Bd2**

**7...Qxc5**

**8.h5**

**8...O-O**

is brave, but also Black's only real alternative to 8...gxh5 and was notably leading Pirc exponent Mihail Marin's recommendation in his Quality Chess GM Repertoire series 2017 work 'The Pirc Defence'. Here White might consider the AlphaZero-like 9.h6!? Bh8 10.Nf3 , but 9.Nh3 can be met by 9...d5 . As such, we prefer to first pose Black a question on the kingside:

**9.hxg6 fxg6**

9...hxg6? is somewhat weaker here as White can go route one: 10.Qc1! Re8 10...Nc6 11.Be3! is a handy move to flick in - 11.Bh6 Ng4 12.Bxg4 Bxc3+! 13.bxc3 Bxg4 isn't quite so clear - and one which will leave White with a strong attack 11...Qa5 12.Bh6 and already Black is simply in huge trouble on the kingside and most likely forced into a desperate advance of his g-pawn to stay on the board 11.Be3 Again, it makes sense to decentralize the black queen before turning attention to the h-file. 11...Qb4 12.a3 Qa5 13.Bh6 Bh8 . This was the point of ...Re8, of course, but it doesn't prevent White from dominating the position: 14.Bd2! . The simple threat is Nd5 followed by Bc3 and if the queen retreats White might increase the pressure with Bc4 and Nf3-g5 or just Bg5: for example, 14...Qc7 15.Bg5 Nc6 16.Qf4 when Black surely won't survive with Qh4 and O-O-O on their way, not to mention the possibility of Rxh8+.

**10.Be3**

Once again White drives the black queen from its central post. He would love to follow up with Qd2 and O-O-O, so Black only really has one critical choice:

**10...Qb4**

This has been seen in two games, but White is yet to find the strongest reply:

**11.Qd3 Qxb2 12.Rb1**

12...Qa3 may appear more obvious, but now we get to see one reason White flicked in the exchange on g6:13.Qc4+! Kh8 14.Nf3 Suddenly Ng5 is a large threat and, with neither black king nor queen entirely happy, White has pretty decent compensation. One key line runs: 14...Nc6 15.Ng5 Ne5 15...h5 can be met in a number of ways, including 16.Rb3 which pretty much forces 16...Qa6 , and that's not the only way to irritate the black queen: 16.Nb5! Qa5+ 17.Bd2 Qb6 18.O-O . White's king is quite safe on g1, Nxd6 is now a threat and 18...Ne5 19.Qc3!? , while quite cheeky, is quite an effective way of threatening Nc7. That and the possibility of arranging f2-f4 allied to White's safer king position should add up to decent compensation. 16.Qc7! which doesn't so much threaten Qxe7 as Rb3.

### (77) Pirc A6: 5...h5 - A6: 5...h5 #1 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 h5**

Black's most popular and sensible choice, stopping our h-pawn in its tracks.

**6.Nf3**

White immediately spies and prepares to take advantage of the main downside to Black's last move, the weakening of the g5-square. It's also possible to rush the knight towards g5 with 6.Nh3 . That's far from a terrible choice, but does allow Black the chance to trade off a potentially problematic bishop with 6...Bxh3 7.Rxh3 . If you like bishops, though, you might well be happy enough here and may wish to consider continuing in aggressive vein with 8.f4!?.

**6...O-O**

Black's best move according to some Pirc sources, only housing the king now that White can't rip open the h-file. Of the alternatives, the most important are 6...Bg4 and 6... c6.

**7.Ng5**

Once again, White wastes no time installing his knight on a fine post from where it can, of course, no longer be kicked by ...h6.

**7...Nc6**

Black again prepares to hit back with ...e5.

**8.Be3**

Overprotecting d4, continuing development and remaining flexible.

**8...e5**

Black's consistent and standard follow-up, if not forced of course.

**9.dxe5**

Here it's important to exchange, not go 9.d5 Nd4 , which was, slightly strangely, the only line considered by Nigel Davies in his 2016 work 'The Pirc: Move by Move'. There's no crafty Nd1 retreat here and 10.Bxd4 exd4 11.Qxd4 c6! leaves Black with promising dark-square, central and even queenside play for his pawn.

**9...Nxe5 10.Qd2**

Simple and flexible chess. Jobava and the late Bosnian IM and leading 5.h4 exponent Zvonimir Mestrovic have preferred 10.f3 , but then Black may be able to cause some problems with 10...c6 and ...d5.

**10...Bd7**

Black too remains flexible. 10...c6 is most simply met by 11.Rd1 , and if 11...Neg4 12.Bc5 . This increases the pressure down the f-file and don't forget that White can still castle short. 10...Neg4?! 11.Bf4 is also not to be feared. Indeed, Black is merely losing time with f2-f3 next up for White.

**11.O-O-O**

Aggressive and logical, although you may also wish to consider 11.O-O !? , a change of approach, if not necessarily a less aggressive one when we note that White might well look to follow up with Rae1 and f2-f4.

**11...b5**

This was the game Kobalia-V.Fedorov, Moscow 1996, where Kasparov's sometime assistant Mikhail Kobalia went 12.f3 when matters weren't totally clear after 12...b4 . As the fine knight on g5 blocks a Bh6, f2-f3, g2-g4 standard attacking plan, we prefer an even more direct pawn move at this point:

**12.f4 Neg4**

12...b4 13.Nd5 is likely to transpose after 13...Neg4 14.Bd4 .

**13.Bd4**

Here it's definitely a good idea to preserve a potentially very important bishop.

**13...b4**

13...c5? might look tempting, but Black's position is too loose for it to work: 14.Bxf6! Qxf6 15.e5! . This closes the long diagonal and leaves Black in huge trouble after a queen retreat and Qxd6 or 15...dxe5 16.Qxd7 .

**14.Nd5**

Black has occupied the hole on g4, but his b-pawn is loose and it appears he is forced to go in for exchanges, leaving White slightly for choice:

**14...Nxd5 15.Bxg7 Kxg7 16.Qxd5**

16...Qe7 and not 16...Ne3?? , or 16...Qf6 17.Rd2! followed by g3 with an edge - or a winning attack if Black prefers 17...Qxf4?? 18.Rf1 . 17.Qd4+ A tricky check. 17...f6! 17...Kg8? 18.Rhe1 a5 19.Bc4 simply leaves White in complete control and all set to crash through with e4-e5, while 17...Qf6?? again forgets about the potential pin down the d-file: 18.e5! , and if 18...dxe5 19.Qxd7 Nf2 20.Rdf1 Nxh1 21.fxe5 , winning. 18.Bf3 White secures his centre. The bad news is that his knight will have to retreat to h3 (it can at least then journey on to f2) , but we still slightly favour his chances. Rhe1 will leave him nicely centralised and not only must Black be careful not to allow a powerful breakthrough with a timely e4-e5, but he must also keep watch over his slightly fragmented queenside.

### (78) Pirc A6: 5...h5 - A6: 5...h5 #2

**12.f4 Neg4**

**13.Bd4**

**13...b4**

**14.Nd5**

**14...a5 15.Nxf6+ Bxf6**

15...Nxf6 is likely the lesser evil, but pretty passive for Black: 16.Bf3 when Rhe1 and e4-e5 will follow.

**16.f5**

appears even stronger than 16.Bc4 . White offers a pawn to open the f-file and after

**16...gxf5 17.exf5 Bxd4**

17...Bxf5 18.Rhf1 Bxd4 19.Qxd4 transposes.

**18.Qxd4 Bxf5 19.Rhf1**

Black will do extremely well to survive, as we can see from 19...Qd7 20.Bxg4 Bxg4 21.Rf6

### (79) Pirc A6: 5...h5 - A6: 5...h5 #3

**13.Bd4**

**13...c5**

might look tempting, but Black's position is too loose for it to work:

**14.Bxf6 Qxf6 15.e5**

This closes the long diagonal and leaves Black in huge trouble after a queen retreat and Qxd6 or 15...dxe5 16.Qxd7

### (80) Pirc A6: 5...h5 - A6: 5...h5 #4 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 h5**

**6.Nf3**

**6...O-O**

**7.Ng5**

**7...Nc6**

**8.Be3**

**8...a6 9.Qd2**

introduces definite ideas of O-O-O and

**9...b5 10.f3**

was@an important way of maintaining control in (by transposition) Rakhmangulov-Balashov, Kolomna 2013. Rather than allow 10.O-O-O b4 , White creates a path for his queen's knight via d1 and f2. He may well now look to break and attack with g2-g4, while the game showcased one further idea:

**10...e5 11.d5**

Rather than our standard exchange.

**11...Nd4 12.Bf1**

Beg@nning to target Black's knight, not allow him plenty of counterplay with 12.Bxd4?! exd4 13.Qxd4 Nh7 ��StartFEN��r1bq1rk1/2p2pb1/p2p1np1/1p1Pp1Np/3nP2P/2N1BP2/PPPQ2P1/R3KB1R b KQ - 2 12��EndFEN�� 12...c5 12...c6! 13.dxc6 Nxc6 likely improves, not that Black should be equal after 14.O-O-O when not only might d6 drop off, but White can go route one with g2-g4, and if ...hxg4; h5, sacrificing to rip open kingside lines. 13.Nd1! Suddenly c2-c3 is quite some threat and 13...b4 14.c3 bxc3 15.bxc3 Nb5 16.a4 Nc7 17.Nb2 Headed for c4 with the knight and left White in control in the game. Note how even 17...Nfe8 18.Nc4 f6 19.Nh3 doesn't especially help Black, since the knight may return to g5 after ...f5 and 19...Bxh3 20.gxh3!? could well lead to significant pressure down the g-file.

### (81) Pirc A6: 5...h5 - A6: 5...h5 #5 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 h5**

**6.Nf3**

**6...O-O**

**7.Ng5**

**7...Nc6**

**8.Be3**

**8...Ng4**

isn't totally ridiculous, but does rid the black king of a potential defender. White should exchange then continue with his standard Qd2-based development scheme:

**9.Bxg4 Bxg4 10.f3 Bd7 11.Qd2**

followed by O-O-O or

**11...e5 12.d5 Nd4 13.Nd1**

when again Black's advanced knight finds itself a little low on squares, while White may limber up for a timely g2-g4.

### (82) Pirc A6: 5...h5 - A6: 5...h5 #6 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 h5**

**6.Nf3**

**6...O-O**

**7.Ng5**

**7...e5**

can be played immediately, but doing so allows White a pleasant choice of routes to an edge. Those who like to keep pieces on may wish to consider 8.d5!? c6 9.Be3 , and if 9...cxd5 10.Nxd5 . The less aggressive, but simple route is our typical exchange:

**8.dxe5 dxe5**

and@now White simply went 9.Be3 , but that allowed 9...Qe7 in Neelash-Warmerdam, Internet (blitz) 2020. We prefer to force matters

**9.Qxd8 Rxd8 10.Bc4**

Again, White makes good use of that fine advanced knight.

**10...Rd7**

10...Rf8? is the move of choice in the related Exchange King's Indian position, but here 11.Be3 or even 11.b3!? leaves Black a little red-faced. He is going to have to create a major weakness with ...c5: for example, 11...Nbd7 12.Ba3 c5 13.Nb5! is already superb for White, who threatens Nd6 and leaves Black majorly struggling to breathe after 13...Ne8 14.O-O-O Bh6 15.Kb1 followed by doubling rooks on the d-file, or if 15...a6 16.Nd6 Nxd6 17.Rxd6 and then Rxg6+, Rhd1 or even just Bd5.

**11.Be3 Nc6 12.Bb5**

This prevents ...Nd4, threatens Bxc6 bxc6; f3 followed by Na4-c5, and leaves White with a pleasant edge. Black might try 12...Rd6!? 13.Bc5 Rd8 when 14.Bxc6 bxc6 is totally clear with ...Nd7-b6 on the way, but here White can always change approach: 14.Bc4!? Rd7 15.Rd1 Nd4 16.Rd2 Now Ne2 and even f2-f4 are in the position and even giving up the dark-squared bishop is far from terrible for White, for instance: 16...b6 17.Bxd4 exd4 18.Ne2 hitting d4 and also intending to increase the pressure on the light squares after Nf4.

### (83) Pirc A6: 5...h5 - A6: 5...h5 #7 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 h5**

**6.Nf3**

**6...O-O**

**7.Ng5**

**7...c5**

is likewise likely premature due to a simple approach from White:

**8.dxc5 dxc5 9.Qxd8 Rxd8 10.Be3**

White's small lead in development already makes itself felt as he presses on c5, while also intending both a timely Bc4 and e4-e5:

**10...Nfd7**

10...b6? 11.e5 will leave Black badly regretting weakening himself on the long light-square diagonal, but 10...Nc6!? 11.Bxc5 b6 , borrowing an idea from the King's Indian Sämisch might be best when 12.Ba3 Bb7 13.O-O prevents ...Nb4 and should leave White slightly for choice whether or not Black tries to continue actively with 13...Nd4 14.Bd3 .

**11.Nd5**

Even stronger than the 11.f4 of Forcen Esteban-Lariño Nieto, Madrid 2012 .

**11...Nc6 12.O-O-O**

Now White is all set to edge forwards with c2-c3 and f2-f4 and how is Black supposed to free his cramped position? He does have 12...Nd4 13.Bf1 followed by c2-c3 or if 13...e6 14.Nc7 Rb8 15.c3 Nc6 when Nb5-d6 is one strong idea, f2-f4 another and there's even 16.Bb5!? Be5 17.Na6!

### (84) Pirc A6: 5...h5 - A6: 5...h5 #8 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 h5**

**6.Nf3**

**6...O-O**

**7.Ng5**

**7...c6**

is again Black's main alternative to trying to counter in the centre and, again, White doesn't have to allow ...b5:

**8.a4**

Once again, 8.O-O !? is also a decent option here and seen below in the pretty instructive encounter Neubauer-Lehner, Austrian League 2017.

**8...Ng4**

8..@e5? is also best avoided as Black due to a simple plan we've already seen on a few occasions: 9.dxe5! dxe5 10.Qxd8 Rxd8 11.Bc4 Rd7 11...Rf8 12.b3! will force Black to badly weaken with ...c5 after Ba3.12.f3 . White simply intends Be3 and Rd1, and it's far from easy for Black to shake off White's firm grip on the position: for example, 12...Nh7 13.Be3 Nxg5 14.hxg5 Re7 15.O-O-O Re8 16.Rd6! already left Black rather struggling to deal with the threat of Rxg6 in Marholev-Banos, Figueres 2007, in view of 16...Kf8 17.Bc5 . 8...Nbd7 was suggested by the strong Slovak GM and noted theoretician Igor Stohl and was tested in Drazic-Lupu, Bastia (rapid) 2000, where White simply went 9.Be3. That can hardly be bad and White might do even better going route one: 9.f4!? 9...e5 10.dxe5 dxe5 11.f5! with early and significant pressure on the kingside and light squares.

**9.f3 Nh6**

This was our introductory game Barua-Nikolic, Biel Interzonal 1993, where a pretty good case was made for 10.Be3 and already White might even have preferred

**10.g4**

This is blunt, but gxh5 is clearly a threat and White is happy to sacrifice:

**10...hxg4 11.h5**

Even 11.fxg4 e5 12.d5 is very promising, if arguably less fun.

**11...gxh5 12.Rxh5**

Now@12...-- 13.fxg4 may just happen or even 12...-- 13.Nh7!? . Black can try to save his knight, but even pushing the f-pawn fails to dent the notion that White is just doing very well: ��StartFEN��rnbq1rk1/pp2ppb1/2pp3n/6NR/P2PP1p1/2N2P2/1PP1B3/R1BQK3 b Q - 0 12��EndFEN�� 12...f6 Alternatively, 12...gxf3 13.Bxf3 keeps the knight stranded, 12...e5 13.Be3 maintains control while preparing Qd2 and O-O-O, and 12...Nd7 fails to, among others, 13.Ne6! fxe6 14.Bxh6 Bxh6 15.Rxh6 Rf6 16.Qd2 Qf8 17.Rh1! . 13.Nh7!? Qe8 13...Kxh7 14.Bxh6 Bxh6? 15.Qd2 regains the piece with a devastating attack. 14.fxg4 Kxh7 15.g5 fxg5 16.Bxg5 Yes, it is a whole piece, but Qd2 is next up and Black is also vulnerable down the b1-h7 diagonal, as shown most obviously by 16...Nd7 17.e5! when even after 17...Rh8 or 17...Rf5 18.Bxh6 18.Qd2 Kg8 19.O-O-O! 19.Bxh6 Qg6 instead would be better for Black! After long castles, however, White's attack should be winning, for instance: ��StartFEN��r1b1q1kr/pp1np1b1/2pp3n/4P1BR/P2P4/2N5/1PPQB3/2KR4 b - - 4 19��EndFEN�� 19...Nf5 20.Rxh8+ Bxh8 21.exd6 Nf8 21...exd6 22.Bc4+! d5 23.Nxd5! cxd5 24.Bxd5+ Kf8 25.Bh6+ is the end, and if 25...Nxh6 26.Qxh6+ Bg7 27.Rf1+ 22.dxe7 Nxe7 23.Rg1 Neg6 24.Bd3 followed by Bh6 or Ne4. The moral of the story: when attacking and the opponent has no counterplay what really matters is not just material, but can the defender successfully use their extra material to desperately plug lines? Here the answer would appear to be a resounding no. For the record, best play according to the silicon beast appears to be: 24...Be6 25.Ne4 threatening both Nf6+ and even Bf6 25...Qf7 26.Bh6 Bxd4 27.Rf1 Qh7 28.Kb1! followed by Qg5 or 28...Bd5 29.Bc4! Ne6 staying afloat for now on the two long diagonals towards the black king, but after 30.Bxd5 cxd5 31.Nf6+ Bxf6 32.Rxf6 Re8 33.Qg2 White will finally regain his piece and be left with an ongoing powerful initiative.

### (85) Pirc A6: 5...h5 - A6: 5...h5 #9 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 h5**

**6.Nf3**

**6...c5**

is, of course, very similar to Line A5. Again, White can advance or exchange, with the latter our preference

**7.dxc5 Qa5**

Here 8.Bd2 would be a little meek, especially when Black might play to occupy the g4-square after 8...Qxc5 , so White has tended to prefer 8.Ng5 Qxc5 9.Be3 . That's pretty logical, but we actually prefer an as-yet-untested approach. It may initially appear greedy, but is also pretty aggressive

**8.cxd6 Nxe4 9.dxe7**

This is clearly critical and is also quite liked by the engines. Moreover, Black is pretty much forced to exchange

**9...Nxc3**

9...Nc6? gives Black good play, but here White can castle and is doing pretty well: 10.O-O Nxc3 or 10...Bxc3 11.bxc3 Nxc3 12.Qe1 Nxe2+ 13.Qxe2 when Black's dark squares are a truly shocking sight. 11.bxc3 Bxc3? 11...Nxe7 is safer, but still leaves Black in serious danger 12.Bg5 when the threats include Qd6, Nd4-b5, Bc4 and Nd2-e4.12.Bg5! is very strong and leaves Black facing ruin thanks to that mighty pawn on e7.12...f6 12...Bxa1 13.Qxa1 Rg8 14.Rd1 leaves Black so tied up he may as well resign! 13.Rb1! This brutal sacrifice is even stronger than 13.Bf4 ; now Rb5 and Qd6 are on their way. 13...fxg5 14.Qd6 Nxe7 15.Bb5+ Kf8 15...Nc6 16.Ne5! is crushing. 16.Rfe1 leaves White with a crushing attack, as shown by 16...Rh7 or 16...Bxe1 17.Qf6+ Kg8 18.Rxe1 17.Nxg5 Rg7 18.Bc4 followed by Re3, with the threat of Rxc3!, or 18...Bxe1 19.Qf6+ Ke8 20.Qxg7

**10.bxc3 Bxc3+ 11.Bd2**

Tak@ng stock, we find White still a pawn to the good and, crucially, with much the safer king. Indeed, White is all set to castle, Black can't take the rook and neither is exchanging on c3 anything close to a panacea for him 11...Bxd2+ 12.Nxd2 Nc6 13.O-O Now Ne4 or Nc4 will follow and while Black doesn't have to recapture the pawn with his king, he will come under significant pressure in any case: 13...Kxe7 13...Nxe7 14.Nc4 comes with tempo, as will Nd6+ and then Bc4.14.Ne4 Qc7 15.Rb1!? This sneaky little move is by no means White's only good one - 15.Bc4 and 15.Re1 both spring more readily to mind -, but prepares to increase the pressure with Rb5 and Qa1, and also sets a little trap: ��StartFEN��r1b4r/ppq1kp2/2n3p1/7p/4N2P/8/P1P1BPP1/1R1Q1RK1 b - - 3 15��EndFEN�� 15...Bf5? 16.Rxb7! and if 16...Qxb7 17.Qd6+ Ke8 18.Nf6# Olé!

**6.Nf3**

**6...Nc6**

angles for ...e5, but White can beat Black to the central bounce

**7.d5 Ne5**

7..@Nb8 is untested, but feels like a safer try when you want be content to manoeuvre with, say, O-O, Nd4 and Be3 or Bg5, but our thematic knight advance is also possible: 8.Ng5 O-O 9.Be3 (Those of a really aggressive bent may also wish to consider 9.f3 c6 10.g4!? .) 9...c6 10.O-O . White is now ready to advance with f4-f5. Two other potentially important moves are Bd4 and a2-a4. The latter restricts Black's counterplay, as even does 10...b5?! 11.a3! again followed by f2-f4 or 11...cxd5 12.Nxd5! , which takes full advantage of some potential loose pieces in the black camp.

**8.Nxe5**

Damaging Black's structure and avoiding allowing him the counterplay that 8.Nd4 c6 would, and if 9.f4? Neg4

**8...dxe5 9.Bg5**

Whi@e finds a second piece able to make good use of the hole on g5 and we'll see how Black might develop in no less a game than Kasparov-Speelman, Paris (rapid) 1990.

### (87) Pirc A6: 5...h5 - A6: 5...h5 #11 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 h5**

**6.Nf3**

**6...Bg4**

is, of course, a possibility allowed by the decision to develop the knight to f3, not h3, but need not be feared. Rather than allow Black to exchange on f3 and strike on the dark squares, White should carry out the thematic leap:

**7.Ng5 Bxe2 8.Qxe2**

The most aggressive and logical follow-up, although Baadur Jobava no less has preferred 8.Nxe2 .

**8...Nc6**

Black should press on the more sensitive of White's central pawns so, whereas 8...Nbd7? merely encourages White's favourite central steamroller: 9.e5 dxe5 10.dxe5 Ng4 11.e6! and Black was already in huge trouble with White's queen or knight set to land on e6 in Garcia Fernandez-P. Garcia, Albacete 1992.

**9.Be3**

White prepares to give up the dark-squared bishop to maintain his strong centre. This is a big decision, but certainly gives Black less counterplay than 9.d5 Nd4 and 9.e5 Nh7!

**9...Ng4 10.O-O-O**

Keeping d4 secure and eyeing both central advances, as well as f2-f4.

**10...Nxe3**

Standard and 10...e6? 11.d5! merely saw White crashing through in Marholev-Sibilio, Roseto degli Abruzzi 2014:11...Nxe3 12.Qxe3 exd5 13.exd5+ Ne7 14.Rhe1 . This clearly prevented Black from castling and while 14...Kf8 15.f3 Nf5 16.Qf2 was possible, this is still very pleasantly better for White thanks to his dominant knight on g5. Now Nce4 and g4 might follow and an exchange on c3 need not be feared: 16...Bxc3 17.bxc3 Qf6 18.g4! . White seizes the initiative and actually has somewhat the safer king, despite the split queenside pawns. Exchanging on g4 would cost Black a piece due to the pin down the f-file and 18...Ng7 19.Qg3! maintains the initiative followed by Rd4-f4 or even Qf4:19...Qxc3? 20.Qf4 f5 21.Re3! Qa1+ 22.Kd2 Qf6 23.gxf5 . White will simply follow up with Rde1 and do just observe how hamstrung Black is due to that gaping weakness on e6.

**11.fxe3**

This creates some immediate threats, although a pretty decent case can also be made for 11.Qxe3 , as played by a young Gajewski, followed by f2-f4 or 11...e5 12.dxe5

**11...Qd7**

11...e5? 12.Rdf1! again sees White playing on the potential weakness of e6. Black clearly can't push the f-pawn, but Rxf7 is a big threat and even 12...Rf8 13.d5 Ne7 14.g4 leaves Black under huge pressure followed by picking off h5 or crashing through down the h-file: 14...hxg4 15.h5 and the rook will reach h7.11...O-O ? 12.g4 reveals why Black should have brought his queen to d7. He is simply quite lost here: 12...hxg4 13.h5! gxh5 14.Rxh5 and can you already spot the mate in four White is threatening?

**12.e5**

Very aggressive, but it makes good sense to seize the initiative with Black's king still in the centre and this appears even stronger than bringing a rook to f1. White now has ideas of not just Rhf1, but also e6 fxe6; Qd3.

**12...Qg4**

12...dxe5 13.dxe5 Qg4 was perhaps a better version of the same idea, if still very good for White after 14.e6! . Clearly going long as Black would drop the exchange and going short walks straight into two powerful pawn blows 12...O-O ? 13.e6! fxe6 14.g4 with an overwhelming attack - just observe how vulnerable Black is on the light squares.

**13.Qb5**

Naturally White retains the queens and now threatens Qxb7, as well as d4-d5.

**13...Rb8 14.Qb3 O-O 15.Rhf1**

Log@cally increasing the pressure. 15.e6? f6! was much less effective in Sherzer-Zaichik, Philadelphia (rapid) 1996.

**15...e6 16.Rf4**

The main point of White's last move. Now Black is pretty much forced to snaffle. 16...Qxg2 17.Rdf1! if 17...Nd8? then 18.Nce4 dxe5 19.Nf6+! followed by dxe5 and Nfh7 or 19...Bxf6 20.Rxf6 crashes through. Black's knight needs to stay on d8 to guard f7, but that leaves his rooks split. Meanwhile White threatens dxe5 and/or Qd3, i.e. 20...exd4 21.Qd3! threatening Rxg6+! and finally picking off f7 after 21...Kg7 22.Qxd4 Kg8 23.Qd7 17...dxe5 18.Rxf7 Rxf7 19.Rxf7 Nd8 20.Re7 Threatening Re8+. 20...Qf1+ 21.Nd1 Qf8 Black has done well to beat off the immediate threats and to get his queen back, but remains vulnerable on the light squares and worse after 22.Rxe6! Kh8 23.Rxg6 Qf5! 24.Qd3 Qxd3 25.cxd3 exd4 26.Kc2 when White is looking for Black to move his knight then go Ne6 or to suddenly increase the pressure with 26...dxe3? 27.Nxe3 and Nf5.

is the computer's clever attempt to deal with White's threats of e5-e6 and to f7, but with Black going backwards, White can go forwards:

**13.Nd5**

The idea is simple: Nf4 to increase the press on the e6 and g6 points and Black appears to be worse even after the best defense:

**13...Bh6 14.Ne4**

Threatening a certain check.

**14...Kf8 15.Rhf1 Kg7 16.Qf3**

Black has survived the worst, but remains tied down and under pressure, with Kb1, Nf2 and g2-g4 one way for White to look to increase it.

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 h5**

**6.Nf3**

**6...c6 7.Ng5**

is a fairly common position as it can arise via both Nf3 and Nh3 move orders. Again we see Black not rushing to commit his king, but having to be wary of a timely e4-e5-e6.

**7...b5**

By some margin Black's main reply and consistent, of course, with his last. Of the alternatives, you'll likely have a good inkling by now of how to punish 7...Nbd7? : 8.e5! . Yes, once again e5-e6 will simply leave Black in huge trouble: 8...dxe5 9.dxe5 Nh7 9...Nxe5 10.Qxd8+ Kxd8 11.f4 is the key tactical point which underpins White's play - all made possible by that huge knight on g5.10.e6 Ne5 11.Qxd8+ Kxd8 left White with a few tempting and strong options in V.Onischuk-Rozhko, European Rapid Championship, Tallinn 2016, of which arguably the strongest wastes no time returning an extra pawn to maintain a virulent initiative: 12.Nxf7+!? Nxf7 13.exf7 Be6 14.Bf4 Bxf7 15.O-O-O+ . Black's cause already looks problematic with both Rhe1 and Ne4 on their way; the latter rather keeps the black knight on h7 as ...Nf6 would be well met by Ng5.

**8.O-O**

This simple and fairly rare choice and accompanying exclaim may come as a small surprise, but there's no need to fear ...b4 and this is one position where, unfortunately, our standard method fails to impress: 8.e5 dxe5 9.dxe5 Qxd1+ 10.Bxd1 Nd5 isn't awful for White, but seems fine for Black largely because, perhaps ironically, White's knight is now away from the key central action on g5, leaving it unable to go to d4 in one move.

**8...O-O**

8...b4 9.Na4 is possible with e4 overprotected and White now has a simple plan: Bd2 and a2-a3 with queenside pressure: for example, 9...O-O 10.Bd2 a5 11.a3 bxa3 12.Rxa3 when White may seize further space with c2-c4 or even look to quickly expand with e4-e5, whether immediately or after a preliminary Bc3 or Bf4.8...Qc7 can be met by either 9.Bf4 e5 10.Bg3 , retaining both control and definite ideas of the pawn breaks a2-a4 and f2-f4, or even the direct 9.f4!? b4 9...Ng4!? may improve, taking advantage of the hole White has just created and preparing to meet 10.e5 with d5. Nevertheless, White does still have a powerful centre and after 10.Bf3 is ready to go both e4-e5 and Ne2, not to mention f4-f5. Perhaps the key line runs: 10...Qb6 11.Ne2 c5 12.e5 Nc6 13.Nc3!? , which does use up two tempi in a rather sharp scenario, but suddenly Nd5 is on its way, after which c2-c3 will bolster things unless Black exchanges, of course: 13...cxd4 14.Nd5 Qd8! Now 15.Nb4? Nxb4 16.Bxa8 Qb6 would leave Black with far too many squares and far too much play for the exchange, but 15.a4! is a timely challenge, and if 15...bxa4 16.Qd3! when the threats include Qc4, Nf6+ and even e5-e6.10.Na4 . Once again, we find White ready to fight back on the queenside, be it with a2-a3 or c2-c3 and 10...Nbd7? 11.e5 Nd5 12.e6! saw Black once again underestimating White's central play at his peril in Palmiotto-Toniutti, Rio Tercero 2012.

**9.Bf4**

White calmly continues to develop. Now Qd2, Rad1 and Rfe1 may follow and even e4-e5 dxe5; Bxe5 becomes an idea in some positions, such as if Black's queen's knight is developed via a6. The immediate threat, though, is e5 dxe5; dxe5, opening the position to favour White's superior development, after which Bf3 and/or a2-a4 may leave Black looking rather overextended. Moreover, it's easy for him to err here:

**9...Nbd7 10.e5**

Suddenly there just isn't a good move for Black with e5-e6 set to land with tempo, or if 10...b4 Angling for 11.Na4 Nd5 . 11.exf6 exf6 12.Nxf7! Rxf7 13.Ne4 when Black once again finds himself badly overextended. He can hold things together for now with 13...d5 14.Nd6 Re7 15.Qd2 a5 but after 16.Rfe1 the pressure will quickly begin to mount, be it with Bd3, a2-a3 or even c2-c4, laying siege to d5 and aiming to go after Black's weaknesses down the c-file

### (92) Pirc A6: 5...h5 - A6: 5...h5 #16 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 h5**

**6.Nf3**

**6...c6 7.Ng5**

**7...Qc7**

is a better way of preparing ...e5 for Black. White has a few options here, but we quite like simply restricting Black's play with

**8.a4**

Now O-O and f2-f4 may follow, as well as Bc4.

**8...e5**

was consistent, but arguably flawed from Black in Jobava-T.L.Petrosian, World Blitz Championship, Moscow 2019, as now White might again have exploited his strong knight to target Black's weakest point, f7:

**9.dxe5 dxe5 10.Bc4 O-O 11.Be3**

White might have lost a tempo with his light-squared bishop, but his pieces coordinate wonderfully. The immediate threat is Bc5 and again we find Black wishing that ...h6 was still legal, with, for example 11...Nbd7 12.Qe2 Ng4 13.Bd2 Nc5 14.f3 Nf6 15.Be3 maintaining control and an excellent version of a Classical Pirc for White who will be quick to increase the pressure, as with 15...Qe7 16.Qf2 b6 17.a5

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 h5**

**6.Nf3**

**6...c6 7.Ng5**

**7...Qa5 8.O-O**

quickly unpins and might be followed by a4, Bc4 or even f2-f4 and e4-e5: for instance,

**8...Na6**

8...b5? 9.e5! would again be most unwise for Black, and if 9...dxe5 10.dxe5 Ng4 11.e6 , thematically crashing through in the centre.

**9.Bc4 O-O**

as in Otero Acosta-Resende, Havana 2006, where

**10.Bb3**

would have prepared to meet

**10...b5 11.Ne2**

Note how again the knight on g5 does a great job, here of overprotecting e4 while pressing on f7. As such, White is all set to increase the pressure with Nf4 or if 11...e5?! 12.f4! thereby further increasing the pressure down the f-file and towards the black king.

### (94) Pirc A6: 5...h5 - A6: 5...h5 #18 

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 h5**

**6.Nf3**

**6...a6**

has been quite rare here, but

**7.Ng5 b5**

is far from ridiculous. This time after

**8.O-O O-O**

8...Bb7? 9.Bf3 menaces a rather nasty e5.

**9.Bf4**

9.e5 dxe5 10.dxe5 Ng4 is simply rather unclear, White can consider not only the centralizing and improving approach that is Qd2, Rad1 and Rfe1, but ideas of e5 and Bf3, while he is all the time waiting for

**9...Bb7**

9...b4!? 10.Nb1 might be critical, but again White has time for this and then Nbd2 and c3 thanks to that Trojan horse on g5.

**10.Bf3**

which is quite powerful now that e5 is coming and there's no ...Bg4 in response.
