**1.e4**

Hello and Welcome to the Quickstarter Guide for Keep it Simple: 1. e4 ! The Quickstarter Guide provides an overview of the most important lines and ideas of the suggested full repertoire. It features the most commonly played lines and therefore studying this guide gives you the opportunity to be ready to employ this repertoire before studying all the dedicated chapters move-by-move. It is the ideal way to start your journey into the world of 1. e4, but it will also be useful at a later stage to give you a condensed overview of the material. Let's get started with some chess moves !</skip>

**1...c5**

The Sicilian Defence is popular on all levels and Black's most respected reply to 1. e4, on par with the classical 1... e5. The nonsymmetrical nature of the position is often leading to a tense, complicated game.The most principled way to fight the Sicilian is to play the Open Sicilian, basically going 2. Nf3 and 3. d4, almost regardless of Black's second move. The main practical issue with this approach is: Black has a very wide range of subvariations that you need to prepare for and most of them require very precise move-by-move knowledge.One key idea of the 'Keep It Simple' approach is that it should be possible for you to find good moves over the board in case you have forgotten your concrete lines. In the Open Sicilian however there are many lines that almost impossible to figure out over the board. It can easily happen that one inaccurate move leads to severe trouble.This is the reason why the Open Sicilian is not featured in this book. Instead I decided to suggest an anti-Sicilian repertoire, based on Bb5 (+) and a delayed c3 (Alapin) , depending on Black's 2nd move choice.One practical advantage of this repertoire is that it starts with 2. Nf3. That means that once you have mastered the lines presented here you can easily, at a later stage, expand your repertoire with an Open Sicilian against a particular Black 2nd move, while still not needing to learn all possible Black systems. For example you may decide at some point to play 3. d4 against 2... e6. That is an open Sicilian, but Black cannot play lines like the Najdorf, Dragon or Sveshnikov anymore. Most likely you would get a Taimanov, Kan, or Scheveningen. That's far more managable than playing the Open Sicilian all the time. This way the suggested repertoire is easily modifyable you may use all of it or replace a particular line with something else later if you so desire.</skip>

**2.Nf3 e6**

This is Black's third most popular move, right after 2... d6 and 2... Nc6. In recent years, the lines connected with it, in particular the Taimanov after 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6, have become very popular. The Taimanov is a good system for Black, but an additional factor in favor of it is that you can avoid any Bb5 lines with this move order. Our repertoire features Bb5 against ...d6 and ...Nc6, but against 2... e6 we need a different approach.</skip>

**3.c3**

My recommendation is to go 3. c3 in style of the Alapin Sicilian. Compared to c3 on move 2 Black is committed to an early ...e6. This of course is not a huge issue for Black, but it greatly reduces Black's choice of lines. This makes it rather easy for White to learn this system.</skip>

**3...Nc6**

A natural developing move that will very often transpose to lines examined via 3...d5.</skip>

**4.d4 cxd4**

This is the only independent option and regarded as imprecise, as White should benefit from the trade. The c3-square is now available to White's Knight.</skip>

**5.cxd4 d5 6.e5**

This is the theoretical argument against Black's move order. We get to an advance French with an early trade on d4 that benefits White, as he is able to play Nc3 early on. However, it needs to be said that it is not a situation where White is clearly better and just needs to learn some moves to prove it. In fact, I am unsure if White has anything better than in a regular French if Black is precise. If you feel uncomfortable in this structure, after 6. e5, you also have the option to simply take on d5 which is playing for a tempo edge in a symmetrical position, or go 6.Nc3 , which very likely gets to an IQP after Black takes on e4. I don't want to examine all this in detail as this move order, for Black, is quite rarely seen. If you want to keep it very simple, 6.exd5 is the way to play.</skip>

**6...Qb6 7.Nc3**

This is possible now compared to the French advance where there are still pawns on c5 and c3.</skip>

**7...Bd7 8.a3 Nge7 9.Na4 Qc7 10.Bd3**

And White enjoys a nice space advantage.</skip>

### (2) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #48 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5**

Now we will quite often reach an IQP position. After 4...exd5 Black often goes for the IQP, while after 4...Qxd5 we will play with the isolated pawn in many cases.</skip>

**4...Qxd5**

Black avoids the IQP with this move and in fact White could be the one with a (favorable) IQP soon. Most of time however we play with an early Na3, intending to harrass the Queen with Nb5, leading to an open centre without an isolated pawn.</skip>

**5.d4 cxd4**

This is a quite clear concession, giving White the good c3 square for the Knight. White will easily get a comfortable IQP position.</skip>

**6.cxd4**

The IQP structure has been discussed a lot in chess literature or media so I only want to give a quick summary of what is most important. The side with the IQP enjoys fluent piece development and does not have any problem pieces. With many pieces on the board the weakness of the isolated pawn is not that pronounced as it is difficult to attack it multiple times. This is not the case after trading minor pieces, when the Rooks and Queen may focus on attacking the pawn. Following this logic the IQP side should keep minor pieces on, and if there are no active opportunities for the Rooks, allow them to be traded. The square in front of the pawn is very important as it may serve as an outpost for the opponent. If the IQP side manages to push the pawn forward and break this potential blockade it is often favorable as piece activity persists, while the weakness gets removed. This is just a brief intro to the IQP, please see some classical examples or books on strategy for more information.</skip>

**6...Nf6 7.Nc3 Qd8**

This is probably the wisest decision. Other squares offer additional tempo gaining possibilities, for White.</skip>

**8.Bd3 Be7 9.O-O O-O 10.Re1 Nc6 11.a3**

This is a rather favorable IQP position, but it is useful for your general chess knowledge to study these structures to understand it better. I will give a typical move sequence to illustrate the dangers for Black, but further study of classical games is very beneficial, here.</skip>

**11...b6 12.Bc2 Bb7 13.Qd3 Rc8**

This normal looking move already puts Black in grave danger.</skip>

**14.d5 exd5**

14... Na5 is the most resilient, but still very bad for Black. After 14... exd5 it's just over immediately.</skip>

**15.Bg5 g6 16.Rxe7 Qxe7 17.Nxd5**

And Black loses decisive material.</skip>

### (3) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #49 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5**

**4...Qxd5**

**5.d4 Nf6**

This is the main line by a mile. This follows the logic that this Knight will be best on f6 with almost 100% certainty, while the optimal position of the other Knight is not as obvious and Bishop moves makes little sense at the moment.</skip>

**6.Na3 Nc6**

With this move Black keeps the Queen on d5 as long as possible.</skip>

**7.Be3**

Very natural play, but it is important to note that instead 7.Nb5 Qd8 8.dxc5 is less promising than it looks due to 8...Bxc5 9.Qxd8+ Kxd8 , and this endgame does not lead to much. It is, of course, an option if you like a quiet game, but I think 7. Be3 is objectively more promising.</skip>

**7...cxd4 8.Nb5 Qd8 9.Nbxd4 Nxd4**

White retains a good game with simple moves.</skip>

**10.Bxd4 Be7 11.Bd3 O-O 12.Qc2**

And White is better both with O-O or O-O-O next. Choose according to taste.</skip>

### (4) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #50 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5**

**4...Qxd5**

**5.d4 Nf6**

**6.Na3 Qd8 7.Nc2**

The Knight on c2 will recapture on d4 if Black takes this pawn. Here both 7.Nc4 and 7.Bf4 are very decent alternatives if you like to vary your play. I went for 7. Nc2 as the next moves are simple to play and yet still good for a comfortable game. We have the general development plan to go for: Bd3, O-O, Qe2, Bf4 or g5 and then centralize the Rooks. This will work pretty much regardless of what Black does.</skip>

**7...Nc6 8.Bd3 Be7 9.O-O**

Very natural, but White does not always need to commit his King early on. I'd also like to refer you to the game Godena-Ter Sahakyan, Plovdiv 2013. In this game White delayed castling in a very similar position and managed to reach a promising position.</skip>

**9...O-O 10.Qe2 b6**

This is seen most often, but Black has tried some other moves. I don't think we needs to examine them all, as White will go Bg5 and Rad1 anyway and be a bit better.</skip>

**11.Bg5**

As mentioned before, this standard setup is always possible. Note that 11.dxc5 is also fine and should be slightly better for White as well.</skip>

**11...Bb7 12.Rad1 cxd4 13.Ncxd4 Nxd4 14.Nxd4 Qd5**

This is Black's most active setup.</skip>

**15.f4**

With an interesting game. White has some attacking chances on the Kingside, but Black is quite solid.</skip>

### (5) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #51 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5**

**4...exd5 5.d4**

Now Black has a wide range of moves to check.</skip>

**5...Nf6 6.Bb5+**

White does not mind trading this Bishop against his c8-counterpart or pinning the Knight on c6 if Black avoids the trade. Playing against the IQP by trading minor pieces is a fine approach.</skip>

**6...Bd7 7.Bxd7+ Nbxd7 8.O-O Be7**

Black quickly closes the e-file before it is too late.</skip>

**9.dxc5 Nxc5 10.Be3 O-O 11.Nbd2**

This position is roughly equal, but is easy to play with the white pieces. You go Qc2, centralize Rooks and maybe go for Bd4 and Nf1-e3, to put pressure on the IQP. Black has active pieces of course, so we cannot count on any substantial edge.</skip>

### (6) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #52 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5**

**4...exd5 5.d4**

**5...Nc6**

This is the most popular move, placing the Knight on the most logical square, looking at the crucial d4-square in front of the future IQP.</skip>

**6.Bb5 Bd6**

Black needs to get his Kingside developed in order to get castled quickly. With Bd6 he usually intends quickly to play Nge7 to avoid the issues that we discuss following 6...Nf6.</skip>

**7.dxc5 Bxc5 8.O-O Nge7 9.Nbd2 O-O 10.Nb3 Bd6 11.Bd3**

This retreat is in fact the most active move. It prevents Bg4 due to Bxh7+ and prepares the battery with Bc2/Qd3 to provoke weaknesses.</skip>

**11...h6**

In order to play Bg4 black avoids Bxh7+.</skip>

**12.h3**

No pin please, an important move.</skip>

**12...Nf5**

A good move that prevents Be3.</skip>

**13.Bc2 Re8 14.Qd3**

Quite inconvenient for Black to meet.</skip>

**14...g6 15.Bd2 Be6**

15... Qf6 is better here, transposing to 14... Qf6.</skip>

**16.Nbd4**

This is strong, inducing multiple trades on d4.</skip>

**16...Ncxd4 17.Nxd4 Nxd4 18.Qxd4**

An excellent scenario for White. Without Knights the position becomes very static and the IQP weakness becomes more pronounced.</skip>

### (7) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #53 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5**

**4...exd5 5.d4**

**5...Nc6**

**6.Bb5 Bd6**

**7.dxc5 Bxc5 8.O-O Nge7 9.Nbd2 O-O 10.Nb3 Bb6**

This and Bd6 are of roughly equal value. Bb6 looks more principled, though, as it still connects with the d4-square. In any case White would like to trade this Bishop. This follows the general rule to trade minor pieces when playing against the IQP and gets rid of Black's better Bishop.</skip>

**11.Re1**

Be3 is a key idea to trade the Bishop, making Re1 a very natural choice.</skip>

**11...Nf5**

Directed against Be3.</skip>

**12.Bd3**

Against Nf5 setups the battery with Bc2/Qd3 is usually a good idea.</skip>

**12...h6 13.Bc2 Be6 14.Qd3 Qf6 15.Be3**

An important point. The f5-Knight is basically pinned, so Be3 is possible now. Note that 15.g4 is answered by 15...Qg6 ! and White gets nothing out of this weakening pawn push.</skip>

**15...Bxe3 16.Rxe3 g6 17.Re2**

This is no fun for Black. He is quite passive and has no dynamic chances to compensate for the IQP weaknesses.</skip>

### (8) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #54 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...Nf6**

This is best in my opinion. Of course, 3... d5 is very respectable as well but I feel that White has more chances for an edge against this move. After 3... Nf6 there is no path to a White advantage, according to modern theory.</skip>

**4.e5 Nd5 5.g3**

White's big main line is 5.d4 of course, but it is rather complicated and Black gets to choose the course of play at important junctions. My choice, 5. g3, is a rather modest move but it is easy to play and learn. If you want to sharpen up your repertoire, 5. d4 is the way to go.</skip>

**5...Nc6**

Black quickly tries to put pressure on the e5-pawn.</skip>

**6.Bg2 Qc7 7.O-O**

Offering the e5-pawn for excellent compensation. Black should probably decline, but we need to check the capture, of course.</skip>

**7...Nxe5**

This is extremely risky, giving White a great initiative. Instead 7...d6 leads to similar positions as after 5... d6, the main line.</skip>

**8.Nxe5 Qxe5 9.Re1 Qd6**

Instead ...Qf5 would leave the Queen even more exposed.</skip>

**10.Na3**

Instead, 10.d4 is fine as well. Just open it up as White is so much ahead in development.</skip>

**10...Be7 11.Qb3 Nf6**

Essentially forced as Bxd5/Nb5 was in the air.</skip>

**12.d4**

With excellent compensation for the pawn.</skip>

### (9) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #55 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...Nf6**

**4.e5 Nd5 5.g3**

**5...d6 6.exd6 Bxd6 7.Bg2 Nc6 8.O-O O-O 9.d4**

White's idea, in this line, is to use the better Bishop position on g2 - better, that is, than his counterpart on c8. We will also try to make use of the Queenside pawn majority, which is often nicely supported by the g2-Bishop.</skip>

**9...cxd4 10.Nxd4 Nxd4 11.Qxd4**

White recaptures with pieces on d4 in order to avoid the IQP. After 11.cxd4 Black easily develops with Bd7-c6 and blockades the pawn.</skip>

**11...Qc7 12.c4**

This is a rare move, but I like it more than the more popular 12.Nd2 , which is, of course, not bad either. I simply feel that I would rather have the Knight on c3 in this position.</skip>

**12...Nf6 13.Nc3 Bd7 14.Rd1 Bc5 15.Qd3 Bc6 16.Qe2 Rfd8 17.Bf4**

This is an equal position. White will try to exploit his majority on the Queenside in the endgame.</skip>

### (10) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 26 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

This is Black's third most popular move, right after ...d6 and ...Nc6. In recent years, the lines connected with it, in particular the Taimanov after 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nc6 , have become very popular. The Taimanov is a good system for Black, but an additional factor in favor of it is that you can avoid any Bb5 lines with this move order. Our repertoire features Bb5 against ...d6 and ...Nc6 , but against e6 we need a different approach. My recommendation is to go 3.c3 in style of the Alapin Sicilian. Compared to c3 on move 2 Black is committed to an early ...e6. This of course is not a huge issue for Black, but it greatly reduces Black's choice of lines. This makes it rather easy for White to learn this system. Other interesting choices here, besides the Open Sicilian of course, are 3.b3 Or 3.g3. These are worth considering if you want to expand the repertoire. I didn't choose them as my main lines because I felt they did not fit into the general concept of this repertoire as well as 3 c3.</skip>

**3.c3**

With Black committed to ...e6 he will usually play ...d5 on move 3 or 4. The only other very serious alternative is Nf6, attacking the pawn and unbalancing the pawn structure, as White needs to advance the e-pawn.</skip>

**3...Nf6**

This is best in my opinion. Of course, d5 is very respectable as well but I feel that White has more chances for an edge against this move. After Nf6 there is no path to a White advantage, according to modern theory.</skip>

**4.e5 Nd5 5.g3**

White's big main line is 5.d4 of course, but it is rather complicated and Black gets to choose the course of play at important junctions. My choice, 5 g3, is a rather modest move but it is easy to play and learn. If you want to sharpen up your repertoire, 5 d4 is the way to go.</skip>

**5...Nc6**

Black quickly tries to put pressure on the e5 pawn.</skip>

**6.Bg2 Qc7 7.O-O**

Offering the e5 pawn for excellent compensation. Black should probably decline, but we need to check the capture, of course.</skip>

**7...Nxe5**

This is extremely risky, giving White a great initiative.</skip>

**8.Nxe5 Qxe5 9.Re1 Qd6**

**10.Na3**

**10...Be7 11.Qb3 Nf6**

**12.d4**

### (11) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 27 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...Nf6**

**4.e5 Nd5 5.g3**

**5...Nc6**

**6.Bg2 Qc7 7.O-O**

**7...d6**

Not very principled, but probably better than taking. We now get a somewhat different version of ... d6 lines as the Black Queen is not necessarily well placed on c7.</skip>

**8.exd6 Bxd6 9.d4 O-O 10.Na3**

Highlighting the issue with the early Qc7.</skip>

**10...a6 11.Nc4 Be7 12.dxc5 Bxc5 13.Qe2**

Black is OK here, but White still has some ideas to try, for example after...</skip>

**13...b5 14.Ne3 Nce7 15.Nxd5 Nxd5 16.a4**

Black still has some questions to answer.</skip>

### (12) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 28 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

This is Black's third most popular move, right after ...d6 and ...Nc6. In recent years, the lines connected with it, in particular the Taimanov after 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nc6 , have become very popular. The Taimanov is a good system for Black, but an additional factor in favor of it is that you can avoid any Bb5 lines with this move order. Our repertoire features Bb5 against ...d6 and ...Nc6, but against e6 we need a different approach. My recommendation is to go 3.c3 in style of the Alapin Sicilian. Compared to c3 on move 2 Black is committed to an early ...e6. This of course is not a huge issue for Black, but it greatly reduces Black's choice of lines. This makes it rather easy for White to learn this system. Other interesting choices here, besides the Open Sicilian of course, are 3.b3 Or 3.g3. These are worth considering if you want to expand the repertoire. I didn't choose them as my main lines because I felt they did not fit into the general concept of this repertoire as well as 3 c3.</skip>

**3.c3**

**3...Nf6**

**4.e5 Nd5 5.g3**

**5...d6 6.exd6 Bxd6 7.Bg2 Nc6 8.O-O O-O 9.d4**

White's idea, in this line, is to use the better Bishop position on g2, better, that is, than his counterpart on c8. We will also try to make use of the queenside pawn majority, which is often nicely supported by the g2 Bishop.</skip>

**9...Bd7**

Black may keep the tension with this move or something like ...h6. Against this, capturing on c5 is a simple and good choice.</skip>

**10.dxc5 Bxc5 11.Qe2**

Intending to play Rd1 and expand on the Queenside.</skip>

### (13) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 29 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...Nf6**

**4.e5 Nd5 5.g3**

**5...d6 6.exd6 Bxd6 7.Bg2 Nc6 8.O-O O-O 9.d4**

**9...cxd4 10.Nxd4 Nxd4 11.Qxd4**

White recaptures with pieces on d4 in order to avoid the IQP. After 11.cxd4 Black easily develops with 11...Bd7 and ...Bc6 and blockades the pawn.</skip>

**11...Qc7 12.c4**

**12...Nf6 13.Nc3 e5**

This is questionable as it weakens d5 permanently.</skip>

**14.Qd3 a6 15.Bg5**

And Black is already in serious trouble.</skip>

### (14) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 30 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...Nf6**

**4.e5 Nd5 5.g3**

**5...d6 6.exd6 Bxd6 7.Bg2 Nc6 8.O-O O-O 9.d4**

**9...cxd4 10.Nxd4 Nxd4 11.Qxd4**

**11...Qc7 12.c4**

**12...Nf6 13.Nc3 Bd7 14.Rd1 Be5 15.Bf4**

An interesting try. Of course, you may also just retreat with Qe3, leading to equal play.</skip>

**15...Bxd4 16.Bxc7 Bxc3 17.bxc3 Rac8 18.Bd6 Rfe8 19.Bxb7 Rxc4 20.Bb4**

And White has an edge with the bishop pair.</skip>

### (15) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 31 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...Nf6**

**4.e5 Nd5 5.g3**

**5...d6 6.exd6 Bxd6 7.Bg2 Nc6 8.O-O O-O 9.d4**

**9...cxd4 10.Nxd4 Nxd4 11.Qxd4**

**11...Qc7 12.c4**

**12...Nf6 13.Nc3 Bd7 14.Rd1 Be5 15.Bf4**

**15...Bxf4 16.Qxf4 Qxf4 17.gxf4**

This is equal, but there is still some play left. The doubled pawn are not exploitable while White has the more active pieces and some pressure.</skip>

### (16) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 32 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...Nf6**

**4.e5 Nd5 5.g3**

**5...d6 6.exd6 Bxd6 7.Bg2 Nc6 8.O-O O-O 9.d4**

**9...cxd4 10.Nxd4 Nxd4 11.Qxd4**

**11...Qc7 12.c4**

**12...Nf6 13.Nc3 Bd7 14.Rd1 Bc5 15.Qd3 Bc6 16.Qe2 Rfd8 17.Bf4**

This is an equal position. White will try to exploit his majority on the queenside in the endgame.</skip>

### (17) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 33 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...Nc6**

A natural developing move that will very often transpose to lines examined via d5</skip>

**4.d4 cxd4**

This is the only independent option and regarded as imprecise, as White should benefit from the trade. The c3 square is now available to White's Knight.</skip>

**5.cxd4 Nf6 6.Nc3**

rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3 Instead 6 e5 transposes to 3...Nf6 4.e5 Nd5 5.d4 , which is not part of our repertoire. 6 Nc3 avoids this transposition and is objectively stronger as well.</skip>

**6...d5 7.e5 Ne4 8.Bd3 Bb4 9.Qc2**

is fine for White, as well.</skip>

### (18) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 34 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...Nc6**

**4.d4 cxd4**

**5.cxd4 Nf6 6.Nc3**

**6...d5 7.e5 Ne4 8.Bd3 Nxc3 9.bxc3 Be7 10.h4**

And White has a promising position on the Kingside. Black must avoid castling now.</skip>

**10...O-O 11.Bxh7+**

and this classic sacrifice wins for White.</skip>

### (19) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 35 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...Nc6**

**4.d4 cxd4**

**5.cxd4 d5 6.e5**

This is the theoretical argument against Black's move order. We get to an advance French with an early trade on d4 that benefits White, as he is able to play Nc3 early on. However, it needs to be said that it is not a situation where White is clearly better and just needs to learn some moves to prove it. In fact, I am unsure if White has anything significant at all if Black is precise. If you feel uncomfortable in this structure, after 6 e5, you also have the option to simply take on d5 which is playing for a tempo edge in a symmetrical position. Or, go 6.Nc3 , which very likely gets to an IQP after Black takes on e4. I don't want to examine all this in detail as this move order, for black, is quite rarely seen. If you want to keep it very simple, 6.exd5 is the way to play.</skip>

**6...Qb6 7.Nc3**

**7...Bd7 8.a3 Nge7 9.Na4 Qc7 10.Bd3**

### (20) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 36 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...Nc6**

**4.d4 cxd4**

**5.cxd4 d5 6.e5**

**6...Bd7 7.Nc3 Nge7 8.Bd3**

is a worse version of Nge7</skip>

### (21) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 37 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...Nc6**

**4.d4 cxd4**

**5.cxd4 d5 6.e5**

**6...Nge7**

This seems to be best choice for Black, immediately aiming for f5 with the Knight.</skip>

**7.Nc3 Nf5 8.a3**

This is useful in order to have Na4 available after a possible Qb6. Without a3 Black may respond with Qa5+/Bb4+ ideas.</skip>

**8...Bd7 9.h4**

The intended follow up is g4, which blocks the annoying response, Nh4. This position is probably slightly better for White, but you see that it is not at all that obvious. You have various options at move 6, so there are other position types available if you like to avoid this French advance structure.</skip>

### (22) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 38 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...Nc6**

**4.d4 d5 5.exd5**

And we will transpose to d5 after either recapture.</skip>

### (23) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 39 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...a6 4.d4 d5 5.exd5**

Again transposes to d5</skip>

### (24) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 40 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...b6**

This is an independent option that is comfortable for White. Black does not fight for the centre and White develops easily.</skip>

**4.d4 Bb7 5.Bd3 Nf6 6.e5**

And this position we examine via a completely different move order, starting with b6, the Owen Defence. I was not sure where to place it (Owen's or c3-Sicilian) , but at the end decided it probably fits more to the 1...b6 move order - so please check this Chapter for more information.</skip>

### (25) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 41 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 exd5 5.d4 Nf6 6.Bb5+**

White does not mind trading this Bishop against his c8 counterpart or pinning the Knight on c6 if Black avoids the trade. Playing against the IQP by trading minor pieces is a fine approach.</skip>

**6...Nc6**

This we check via the 5... Nc6 6 Bb5 move order.</skip>

### (26) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 42 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 exd5 5.d4 Nf6 6.Bb5+**

**6...Bd7 7.Bxd7+ Qxd7**

This is somewhat questionable as now there is no Knight on d7 that is able to recapture on c5 comfortably.</skip>

**8.O-O Nc6 9.Re1+ Be7 10.dxc5 O-O 11.Bg5**

This is very bad for Black already, being a pawn down or allowing Bxf6 destroying the pawn structure.</skip>

### (27) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 43 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 exd5 5.d4 Nf6 6.Bb5+**

**6...Bd7 7.Bxd7+ Qxd7**

**8.O-O Nc6 9.Re1+ Ne4 10.Bf4 Be7 11.Nbd2 Nxd2 12.Qxd2**

White is very comfortable here, being better developed and coordinated.</skip>

**12...O-O 13.dxc5 Bxc5 14.Rad1 Rad8 15.Bg5 f6 16.Be3**

And White managed to get a good anti-IQP game.</skip>

### (28) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 44 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 exd5 5.d4 Nf6 6.Bb5+**

**6...Bd7 7.Bxd7+ Nbxd7 8.O-O Be7**

**9.dxc5 Nxc5 10.Be3 O-O 11.Nbd2**

This position is roughly equal, but White is easy to play. You go Qc2, centralize rooks and maybe go for Bd4 and Nf1-e3, to put pressure on the IQP. Black has got active pieces of course, so we cannot count on any substantial edge.</skip>

### (29) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 45 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 exd5 5.d4 c4**

This is not well-timed at this particular moment.</skip>

**6.b3 b5 7.a4**

And Black will lose the queenside.</skip>

### (30) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 46 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 exd5 5.d4 c4**

**6.b3 cxb3**

This is forced.</skip>

**7.axb3 Bd6 8.Bd3 Ne7 9.O-O O-O 10.Na3**

White is also better after other moves, but this is a nice move, intending Nb5 or just Nc2-e3 to move the pieces to the Kingside. White is better in the centre and has nice chances after the natural...</skip>

**10...Nbc6 11.Nh4**

This controls f5 and prepares f2-f4 to attack.</skip>

### (31) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 47 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 exd5 5.d4 a6**

This move avoids an early Bb5 (+) and is often quite useful later on. This position also arises frequently after a6, the O'Kelly variation.</skip>

**6.Bd3**

A natural move. But other normal development moves would be fine as well, for instance 6.Be2 Or 6.Be3.</skip>

**6...Nc6 7.O-O cxd4 8.Re1+ Be7 9.Nxd4 Nf6 10.Be3 O-O 11.h3**

A quite typical position has been reached. White is very slightly better.</skip>

### (32) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 48 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**6.Bd3**

**6...Nc6 7.O-O cxd4 8.Re1+ Be7 9.Nxd4 Nxd4 10.cxd4**

White has an annoying pull here.</skip>

**10...Nf6 11.Nc3 O-O 12.Bg5 Be6 13.Bc2**

Intending Qd3 and Bb3 ideas. Black is doomed to a passive defence.</skip>

### (33) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 49 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 exd5 5.d4 a6**

**6.Bd3**

**6...c4**

The most ambitious move, which is quite in line with the early ...a6.</skip>

**7.Bc2 Bd6 8.b3**

The normal reaction to c5-c4.</skip>

**8...b5 9.a4**

Is fine for White. He opens up the queenside while being better developed.</skip>

### (34) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 50 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**6.Bd3**

**6...c4**

**7.Bc2 Bd6 8.b3**

**8...cxb3 9.axb3 Ne7 10.O-O O-O 11.Ba3**

Black is close to being equal now, but we still have the slightly better structure and easy moves like Re1 will follow.</skip>

### (35) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 51 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 exd5 5.d4 Nc6**

This is the most popular move, placing the Knight on the most logical square, looking at the crucial d4 spot in front of the future IQP.</skip>

**6.Bb5 Nf6**

This is the move that Black ideally wants to play. The Knight has its most active post on f6, but it allows a pin by Bg5 and does not block the e-file, like Nge7 in the main line does.</skip>

**7.O-O Be7 8.dxc5 Bxc5 9.Bg5 Be6 10.Nbd2 O-O 11.Nb3 Bb6 12.Nbd4**

White retains a slight edge here as the IQP is safely blockaded and the pin on the f6 Knight is quite unpleasant for Black to handle.</skip>

### (36) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 52 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 exd5 5.d4 Nc6**

**6.Bb5 Bd6**

Black needs to get his Kingside developed in order to get castled quickly. With Bd6 he usually intends quickly to play Nge7 to avoid the issues that we discuss following Nf6.</skip>

**7.dxc5 Bxc5 8.O-O Nf6 9.Bg5**

This we examine via the Nf6 move order.</skip>

### (37) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 53 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 exd5 5.d4 Nc6**

**6.Bb5 Bd6**

**7.dxc5 Bxc5 8.O-O Nge7 9.Nbd2 O-O 10.Nb3 Bd6 11.Bd3**

**11...h6**

**12.h3**

**12...Bc7**

Black aims to set up a battery himself.</skip>

**13.Re1 Qd6 14.Be3 b6 15.Nbd4 a6**

After instead 15...Nxd4 16.Bxd4 White keeps firm control over the d4-square.</skip>

**16.Bc2**

And White is in excellent shape. He is very well coordinated and has no weaknesses, while Black has multiple problems with the pawn structure.</skip>

### (38) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 54 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 exd5 5.d4 Nc6**

**6.Bb5 Bd6**

**7.dxc5 Bxc5 8.O-O Nge7 9.Nbd2 O-O 10.Nb3 Bd6 11.Bd3**

**11...h6**

**12.h3**

**12...Nf5**

**13.Bc2 Re8 14.Qd3**

**14...Qf6 15.Bd2**

Grabbing the pawn on d5 does not lose immediately but gives Black strong compensation. We should rather focus on development. Note that 15.g4 Nh4 leads to absolutely nothing as we only have a harmless check on h7. The battery, here, is a constant worry for Black, but we need to be cautious how we actually execute the 'threat', especially if we have to weaken our position like 15 g4 does here.</skip>

**15...Be6 16.Rfe1 g6 17.Re2**

I prefer White here but Black is not in terrible shape either. His pieces are active and the weaknesses are not an immediate problem.</skip>

### (39) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 55 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**6.Bb5 Bd6**

**7.dxc5 Bxc5 8.O-O Nge7 9.Nbd2 O-O 10.Nb3 Bd6 11.Bd3**

**11...h6**

**12.h3**

**12...Nf5**

**13.Bc2 Re8 14.Qd3**

**14...g6 15.Bd2 Be6**

15...Qf6 is better here, transposing to 14...Qf6</skip>

**16.Nbd4**

**16...Ncxd4 17.Nxd4 Nxd4 18.Qxd4**

### (40) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 56 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 exd5 5.d4 Nc6**

**6.Bb5 Bd6**

**7.dxc5 Bxc5 8.O-O Nge7 9.Nbd2 O-O 10.Nb3 Bb6**

This and Bd6 are of roughly equal value. Bb6 looks more principled, though, as it still connects with the d4 square. In any case White would like to trade this bishop - it follows the general rule to trade minor pieces vs the IQP and gets rid of Black's better bishop.</skip>

**11.Re1**

Be3 is a key idea to trade the bishop, making Re1 a very natural choice.</skip>

**11...Nf5**

**12.Bd3**

**12...h6 13.Bc2 Be6 14.Qd3 Qf6 15.Be3**

An important point. The Nf5 is basically pinned, so Be3 is possible now. Note that 15.g4 is answered by 15...Qg6 ! and White gets nothing out of this weakening pawn push.</skip>

**15...Bxe3 16.Rxe3 g6 17.Re2**

### (41) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 57 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 exd5 5.d4 Nc6**

**6.Bb5 Bd6**

**7.dxc5 Bxc5 8.O-O Nge7 9.Nbd2 O-O 10.Nb3 Bb6**

**11.Re1**

**11...Nf5**

**12.Bd3**

**12...h6 13.Bc2 Be6 14.Qd3 Re8 15.Bd2 Rc8 16.Nfd4**

This is an idea if Black avoids ...g6.</skip>

**16...Ncxd4 17.Nxd4 Bxd4 18.cxd4 Qf6 19.Bc3**

This is slightly better for White due to the bishops, but Black is quite solid, obviously.</skip>

### (42) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 58 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 exd5 5.d4 Nc6**

**6.Bb5 Bd6**

**7.dxc5 Bxc5 8.O-O Nge7 9.Nbd2 O-O 10.Nb3 Bb6**

**11.Re1**

**11...Bg4 12.h3 Bh5 13.Be3**

And White is comfortable again, being able to trade the Bishops on e3 or pushing Black's Bishop back to c7.</skip>

### (43) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 59 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 Qxd5**

After this recapture White will get an IQP almost all of the time, while after exd5, roles are reversed quite often - Black usually allows his d-pawn to be isolated. The IQP structure has been discussed a lot in chess literature or media so I only want to give a quick summary of what is most important. The side with the IQP enjoys fluent piece development and does not have any problem pieces. With many pieces on the board the weakness of the isolated pawn is not that pronounced as it is difficult to attack it multiple times. This is not the case after trading minor pieces, when the rooks and Queen may focus on attacking the pawn. Following this logic the IQP side should keep minor pieces on, and if there are no active opportunities for the rooks, allow them to be traded. The square in front of the pawn is very important as it may serve as an outpost for the opponent. If the IQP side manages to push the pawn forward and break this potential blockade it is often favorable as piece activity persists, while the weakness gets removed. This is just a brief intro to the IQP, please see some classical examples or books on strategy for more information.</skip>

**5.d4 Nc6**

This has little independent value as ...Nf6 will be the next move most of the time.</skip>

**6.Na3 a6**

This addresses Nb5, but the cure is worse than the disease.</skip>

**7.Nc4**

b6 is a glaring weakness.</skip>

**7...Qd8 8.Be3**

White's developmental advantage is reaching alarming proportions.</skip>

**8...b5 9.Nce5 Nxe5 10.Nxe5 cxd4 11.Bxd4 Nf6 12.a4 b4 13.a5**

And Black will probably only last for a few more moves, facing Qa4+ and Be2-f3.</skip>

### (44) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 60 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 Qxd5**

**5.d4 Nc6**

This has little independent value as Nf6 will be the next move most of the time.</skip>

**6.Na3 cxd4**

This is ill-timed.</skip>

**7.Nb5 Qd8 8.Bf4**

and it's 'game over'.</skip>

### (45) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 61 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 Qxd5**

**5.d4 Nc6**

**6.Na3 cxd4**

**7.Nb5 Bd6**

The only move already.</skip>

**8.Bc4 Qe4+ 9.Be3 Bb8 10.Nbxd4**

And White is a lot better with excellent mobilization.</skip>

### (46) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 62 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 Qxd5**

**5.d4 Nc6**

**6.Na3 Qd8 7.Nc2 Nf6**

This leads to the main line starting with Nf6.</skip>

### (47) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 63 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 Qxd5**

**5.d4 Nc6**

**6.Na3 Nf6 7.Be3**

And we have transposed to the main line that usually starts with Nf6.</skip>

### (48) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 64 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 Qxd5**

**5.d4 cxd4**

**6.cxd4 Nf6 7.Nc3 Qd8**

This is probably the wisest decision. Other squares offer additional tempo gaining possibilities, for White.</skip>

**8.Bd3 Be7 9.O-O O-O 10.Re1 Nc6 11.a3**

**11...b6 12.Bc2 Bb7 13.Qd3 Rc8**

**14.d5 exd5**

14...Na5 is the most resilient, but still very bad for Black. After ...exd5 it's just over immediately.</skip>

**15.Bg5 g6 16.Rxe7 Qxe7 17.Nxd5**

### (49) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 65 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 Qxd5**

**5.d4 a6**

This is quite rare in this particular position, but the position sometimes arises from 2... a6 3 c3, which is also part of our repertoire.</skip>

**6.Bd3**

Other developing moves are also fine, of course.</skip>

**6...Nf6 7.O-O Be7 8.dxc5**

This capture is a bit more promising for White here compared to other, similar positions due to the weakness on b6. White should be slightly better with other sensible moves as well.</skip>

**8...Qxc5 9.Bf4 O-O 10.Nbd2**

White is slightly better here. He is well developed and Black still has no great option for his Bishop on c8. White's next moves will likely be Qe2, a4, Nc4 to increase pressure on the Queenside.</skip>

### (50) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 66 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 Qxd5**

**5.d4 Nf6**

**6.Na3 Nc6**

**7.Be3**

Very natural play. But it is important to note that instead 7.Nb5 Qd8 8.dxc5 is less promising than it looks due to 8...Bxc5 9.Qxd8+ Kxd8 , and this endgame does not lead to much. It is, of course, an option if you like a quiet game, but I think 7 Be3 is objectively more promising.</skip>

**7...cxd4 8.Nb5 Qd8 9.Nbxd4 Nxd4**

This is too accommodating. White retains a good game with simple moves.</skip>

**10.Bxd4 Be7 11.Bd3 O-O 12.Qc2**

And White is better both with O-O or O-O-O next. Choose according to taste - for a nice example of the O-O-O see the game So-Akobian, St. Louis 2016.</skip>

### (51) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 67 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 Qxd5**

**5.d4 Nf6**

**6.Na3 Nc6**

**7.Be3**

**7...cxd4 8.Nb5 Qd8 9.Nbxd4 Nd5 10.Nxc6 bxc6 11.Bd2**

11.Bd4 is also interesting, but plans involving ...f6 are a bit murky. Our move is simple, but also good for a slight pull.</skip>

**11...Bc5 12.Bd3 O-O 13.O-O**

With a nice structural edge for White.</skip>

### (52) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 68 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 Qxd5**

**5.d4 Nf6**

**6.Na3 Nc6**

**7.Be3**

**7...cxd4 8.Nb5 Qd8 9.Nbxd4 Nd5 10.Nxc6 bxc6 11.Bd2**

**11...Qb6**

Black may also develop the Bishop f8, of course, but this move is the only one that requires a concrete reaction.</skip>

**12.Bd3**

We happily offer the b2 pawn as we are much better developed.</skip>

**12...Qxb2 13.O-O**

With excellent attacking chances for White.</skip>

### (53) 6. Sicilian & Others 1.e4 c5 2 - 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and others 69 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6**

**3.c3**

**3...d5 4.exd5 Qxd5**

**5.d4 Nf6**

**6.Na3 Qd8 7.Nc2**

The Knight on c2 will recapture on d4 if Black takes this pawn. Here both 7.Nc4 And 7.Bf4 are very decent alternatives if you like to vary your play. I went for 7 Nc2 as the next moves are simple to play and yet still good for a comfortable game. We have the general development plan to go for: Bd3, O-O, Qe2, Bf4 or g5 and then centralize the rooks. This will work pretty much regardless what Black does.</skip>

**7...Nbd7**

Black opts for a setup with the Knight on d7. He could have started this setup with Be7 and 8...O-O as well, of course. Our setup is the standard one mentioned earlier.</skip>

White is slightly better here. We will play Rfe1 and Ne5, next, and see how Black reacts. Our good centralized pieces give us some options, from piece based Kingside play to playing on the Queenside with ideas like Ne5-c4-d6.</skip>

The more active pieces again give White a small advantage. Simple moves, like Qc2/Be5, and centralization of the rooks will follow.</skip>

The Knight on c2 will recapture on d4 if Black takes this pawn. Here both 7 Nc4 and 7 Bf4 are very decent alternatives if you like to vary your play. I went for 7 Nc2 as the next moves are simple to play and yet still good for a comfortable game. We have the general development plan to go for: Bd3, O-O, Qe2, Bf4 or g5 and then centralize the rooks. This will work pretty much regardless what Black does.</skip>
