## Fianchetto with Nc3 - 9.Bg5

**1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 c5**

This is the starting position of the Tarrasch Defense.

**4.cxd5 exd5 5.g3**

The fianchetto variation has always stood out as the critical method of combating the Tarrasch. The main reason is that from g2, the bishop will be able to exert great pressure on d5. In addition, the castled king will be highly secure.

**5...Nf6**

Playing ...Nf6 before ...Nc6 is important. This idea has only recently become known and is quickly gaining in popularity, avoiding dull and tedious endgames and spicing stuff up.

**6.Bg2 Nc6 7.O-O Be7 8.Nc3 O-O 9.Bg5**

We have reached what could be considered the main line of the Tarrasch.

**9...c4**

This closing of the center, and thus precluding White's chance of giving us an isolani is an idea we use frequently in the Tarrasch Defense.

Having created a majority on the queenside, our play will often revolve around utilizing it through ...b7-b5. White, on the other hand, will often attempt to break our structure through b2-b3 or create a central play using e2-e4 and/or f2-f4.

**10.Ne5**

This is by far the main move. The knight occupies an active post in the center of the board, and at the same time vacates the long diagonal, so the bishop pressurizes d5.

**10...Be6**

Developing the bishop and even more importantly, overprotecting d5. In their fight for the opening advantage, White has tried everything under the sun, yet hits a brick wall every time.

It might help us to know that even though White has several options at their disposal, we often play a quick ...h6, immediately challenging the bishop.

**11.Rc1**

This has been played by several strong players, among them 14th World Champion Vladimir Kramnik. Yet, I fail to see the point.

**11...h6**

This typical move works well here, even better than in most variations.

**12.Bxf6 Bxf6 13.f4**

This was Kramnik's choice in his game against a top player, Chessable author, and countrymate of mine, Anish Giri.

**13...Bxe5!**

Giri played 13...Ne7, which is perfectly fine as well. However, I think 13...Bxe5 is a bit better.

**14.fxe5**

14.dxe5 would lose a pawn after 14...Qb6+.

**14...b5!**

Setting our majority in motion, with a fantastic position.

## Fianchetto with Nc3 - 9.dxc5

**9.dxc5**

This is the second most played move after 9.Bg5. By releasing the tension in the center, the opponent gives us the isolani immediately.

Play will now revolve around the question of whether the pawn on d5 is a liability or a strength. While White will try to either block or attack it, we can use our active pieces and space advantage, granted by the isolated pawn, to disturb the opponent's plans.

**9...Bxc5**

There is an option of gambitting the pawn entirely through 9...d4, but practice has shown that it is best to restore material balance instead. White is at crossroads here, having several ways of completing development.

As for our ideal piece configuration, it is quite straightforward. For the rooks, the ideal positions are generally e8 and c8 or d8, standing useful on the (semi-)open files. The real question remains for our light-squared bishop, as it might stand well on either e6, f5 or g4 depending on the situation.

As usual, when playing with the isolani we should always be on the lookout for opportunities of pushing it forward at an opportune moment, as the further it advances the more of a menace it becomes to the opponent.

**10.a3**

White is not hiding any intentions with this move. The plan is to push b2-b4 and force our bishop away from c5.

**10...a5**

After some deliberation, I have decided to recommend this simple prophylaxis against the b2-b4 idea. While it is true that we have given up on the b5-square now, this doesn't seem to be a great deal of worry to us.

Instead, Black can sacrifice a pawn with 10...Ne4!?, but this generally results in an endgame that is a bit too dry for my taste.

The text keeps all the pieces on the board. Moreover, it is not a common move at all, so you are quite likely to surprise your opponent here.

**11.Bg5**

As mentioned, you will be by far the most likely to face this move. Although there are some subtle differences, play will be extremely similar to 10.Bg5.

**11...d4 12.Bxf6 Qxf6**

Now both 13.Nd5 and 13.Ne4 are playable for White.

**13.Nd5 Qd8 14.Ne1**

As usual, White can go for the classical knight maneuver Ne1-d3.

**14...Re8 15.Nd3 Bf8**

Tucking away the bishop to where it's safe and sound.

**16.Rc1 a4**

I quite like this option of paralyzing the white queenside, and creating an idea of ...Ra5 as well. Of course, we can also just develop the light-squared bishop and have a reasonable position.

Examine the Fianchetto variations thoroughly in the main course.

## Fianchetto without Nc3 - 8.dxc5 Bxc5 9.a3

**8.dxc5 Bxc5 9.a3**

A highly topical variation that is also popular within the Chessable community, as both Sielecki and Naryanan recommend it in their courses. White's intentions are crystal clear - they wish to play b2-b4 and fianchetto the other bishop as well.

Interestingly, the little pawn move on the edge of the board is the best scoring move in the database. The combination of being easy to play yet very challenging creates the recipe for an attractive variation. It is therefore no wonder that the move is so popular and obtained the stamp of approval from the likes of Smyslov and Kramnik.

**9...Ne4!**

The sweet words about White's previous move should not leave us second-guessing our choice of opening, as the versatility of the Tarrasch Defense is of great magnitude! The dynamic potential and active piece play will always allow us to have resources available.

This energetic jump by our knight is a prime example. Since White has not developed their knight to c3 yet, we use the opportunity to occupy a strong central square. Moreover, the f6-square is vacated for our bishop, from where it can contest White's reign over the a1-h8 diagonal.

Note that this line should not be confused with the 9.Nc3 O-O 10.a3 variation, in which I recommend going 10...a5.

In the current position, 9...a5 would be dubious after 10.Bg5 O-O 11.Qc2!, followed by 12.Rad1.<addx start="12.Rad1"/>

**10.b4**

By far the most logical move. White continues the plan that they put in motion on their previous move.

**10...Be7!**

Not a common retreat, but one that highlights another advantage of having played 9...Ne4. The bishop can reroute itself to f6, fighting for the long diagonal.

**11.Bb2**

The bishop occupies the long diagonal, perhaps hoping to live a long and happy life...

**11...Bf6**

Immediately opposing White's bishop is the right strategy. Remarkably, from the 31 games that reached this position, White's best move was only played in two correspondence games. This is a clear indication that White is facing a tough decision here.

**12.Qc1**

This might be White's best bet at fighting for an advantage. The queen stands reasonably safe here, it protects the bishop on b2 and vacates d1 for the rook.

**12...O-O**

Simply castling is our best bet, asking our opponent how they would like to proceed and adapting our plans accordingly.

**13.Rd1**

A logical continuation of the previous move. The rook stands well on the half-open file.

**13...Re8**

We follow suit - our rook stands just as well on the half-open file.

**14.Nbd2**

A relevant point of our previous move is demonstrated by the fact that 14.Nc3 Nxc3 15.Bxc3 Rxe2 works well for us. Consequently, White is forced to develop their knight to d2.

**14...Nd6!**

Avoiding the trade of knights is a common idea in this line, and it is an improvement over the correspondence games, that continued with 14...Bxb2.

Backward knight moves are the toughest moves to spot, so definitely familiarize yourselves with this idea. The rook now hits the pawn on e2 and we can proceed by developing our light-squared bishop and eventually the other rook to c8 with a satisfactory position.

There are a lot of options, and you can learn more about it in the main course.

## 5.Bg5 #1

**5.Bg5**

A vicious variation that should be treated seriously. As I have not been able to find a name for this variation yet, I would name it the Korchnoi Variation as he was one of the first to employ it regularly at a high level.

**5...Nf6**

This is our choice at all times.

5...Be7 is the most popular option but the exchange of bishops leads to somewhat worse and passive positions for us, with no hope for more than a draw.

**6.Nc3 Be6**

This position signifies a major component in our repertoire. White is at crossroads and it is our task to carefully examine their options. To clarify things, White has about 3 ways to approach the position:

1. They can either prepare for a quick assault going e2-e4, creating a sharp mess in the process.

2. Most people give preference to playing a slower game through e2-e3, intending to simply develop the bishop and castle.

3. Last, but certainly, not least is the ever-existing option of a fianchetto by going g2-g3. There are a few other sidelines, but they are no reason for concern.

**7.Bxf6**

I consider this to be one of the most dangerous lines in the entire course. Generally, the exchange of bishop for knight would be good for us, but in this specific case, White has a very concrete idea in mind of opening the position through e2-e4. By first sidetracking our queen this idea gains in strength. However, while being a serious attempt at gaining the advantage, I believe that we will be well-armed to fight it.

**7...Qxf6**

There is no real choice as recapturing with the pawn would ruin our pawn structure.

**8.e4**

White continues with the aforementioned idea.

**8...dxe4**

Again there is not much choice as we cannot allow White to take on d5 with the pawn. Now, White can either recapture on e4 immediately or interpose a check on b5 first.

In my view, 9.Nxe4 is the most testing of both as it retains some more flexibility in White's options. In general, however, both moves likely lead to the same position.

**9.Nxe4 Qf4!**

Our queen finds a nice home here, as it cannot easily be attacked and it attacks the white knight at the same time.

**10.Nxc5**

This is not in the spirit of the position, as there is no good reason to give up the active knight for our undeveloped bishop.

**10...Bxc5 11.dxc5 Nc6**

The position is excellent for us.

## 5.Bg5 #2

**7.g3**

As in any other variation of the Tarrasch Defense, the fianchetto makes a lot of sense here, adding pressure on d5. Would we put the bishops on g5 and e6 back on their original squares we would have the precise main line on the board. The inclusion of these moves makes things a little weird, however.

Our usual development scheme of ...Be7 and ...O-O is less good now, as Bg5 would be more useful than our ...Be6. For that reason, we must change our plans and be creative.

**7...Nc6**

This cannot be wrong, we must bring the knight out.

**8.Bg2 h6!**

The one disadvantage of deploying the bishop out early on is that it can be attacked. Taking full advantage of that fact we force White to make a tough decision, as to what to do with the bishop.

**9.Bxf6!**

The correct decision. Preserving the bishop with 9.Bf4 would be an admission of failure and give us a very comfortable version of the regular fianchetto lines by going 9...c4 in reply.

**9...Qxf6 10.dxc5**

There is no reason to lose any sleep over this capture as we are doing well in several ways.

**10...Rd8**

I prefer this move, but if you are in for some fun, 10...O-O-O is definitely an option worth exploring.

Now if we get to capture on c5, we will have an excellent position.

**11.Na4**

The only way to defend c5, but it certainly looks clumsy.

**11...g5!**

I like such play very much. The bishop may be developed to g7 and plans such as ...h5-h4 with an attack are on the table.

**12.O-O h5**

The lost pawn is not felt at all, and our plan of attack is simple and good.

This is not all! If you want to learn more about this opening, go ahead and study the 5.Bg5 chapter in the main course.

## 5th Move Sidelines

**1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3**

With 3.Nc3, White could intend to play 3...c5 4.cxd5 or 3...c5 4.dxc5. However, reaching the fianchetto main lines (with Nc3) is still the most likely scenario.

**3...c5 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Bf4**

This move was featured in the very first game Von Bardeleben-Tarrasch, 1888(!). It does not put all that much pressure on the center and therefore gives us a reasonably smooth game.

As kids, we learned that it's generally better to develop knights before bishops and that holds very much true here, as 5.Nf3 is by far the most testing move.

**5...Nc6 6.Nf3 Nf6**

Simple play works best. Now, White has a choice to make on how to bring out the kingside pieces.

**7.e3**

This is by far the most popular move and to the human eye, it makes a lot of sense because White has already brought the bishop outside the pawn chain to f4 instead of leaving it obstructed and looking at its pawns on c1.

**7...c4!**

A key concept in many variations and one of which students of the Tarrasch should familiarize themselves with. By releasing the tension in the center, Black creates a majority on the queenside which he will often aim to expand further by preparing ...b5-b4.

In addition to that, the black bishop suddenly finds a great square on b4. From there it pressures the white knight, really hindering them from pushing e3-e4 any time soon.

**8.Be2 Bb4! 9.O-O O-O**

According to my database, 9...Bxc3 is played more frequently, but I fail to understand why. Even though ...Bxc3 followed by ...Ne4 is often an idea in these positions, it is wiser to castle first.

**10.Ne5**

The most popular move, but after one more strong move, Black is already on the better side of equality.

**10...Ne7**

I very much like this move, avoiding the trade of knights. Black has several plans available and the idea of trading on c3 followed by ...Ne4 is very much in the air.

Once our knight sits prettily on e4, we can consider moves such as ...f6, forcing the white knight back. Another idea would be to go ...Ne8, once again with the same idea of playing ...f6. The idea of going ...a6+...b5 is always very much an option too.

## 4th Move Sidelines

**1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 c5 4.e3**

Although the text move has been around for ages, it?s generally considered an innocuous move. However, in the day and age where there are so many lines of computer analysis and the workload is just enormous, people have started to aim for positions where the advantage will be minimal, but the game will remain complex.

White avoids the heavy theory that arises after 4.cxd5, but instead aims for a calmer setup, while still retaining all the pieces on the board.

**4...Nf6**

I believe there is not much difference between this and 4...Nc6, but somehow bringing out the g8-knight first feels more natural to me.

**5.cxd5**

Releasing the tension in the center early on contains a point that becomes apparent soon.

**5...exd5**

Capturing back with the pawn should be a no-brainer.

**6.Be2**

This move feels very soft. Naturally, it doesn't put us under a lot of pressure.

**6...Nc6 7.O-O cxd4**

Before developing the kingside it is accurate to include this move, so we shouldn't have to move the bishop twice in case of dxc5 by White.

**8.Nxd4 Bd6 9.b3**

Besides just wanting to play Bb2, this move entails another idea which is good to be aware of.

**9...Qe7!**

If we play 9...O-O, White gets the extra option of playing 10.Ba3!?, exchanging the bishops. Although by no means a disaster, it is preferable to avoid this exchange. Since we have the isolani, we would like to maximize the number of minor pieces on the board, as piece activity will compensate for the structural deficit.

**10.Bb2 Qe5**

Another bonus of our last move is that we can take this opportunity to threaten mate in one.

**11.g3**

Preventing mate in one, but it has left some weak light squares around the king.

**11...O-O 12.Nd2 Qe7**

The queen has done its duty and now it's time to return to safety. Although the white monarch is in no immediate danger, the weakened light squares will be a permanent source of counterplay for us.

If your opponent loves to deviate quickly, don't worry. This is only the Short & Sweet. Be sure to study the main course, where you will learn to play against all systems

## London 2.Bf4

**1.d4 d5 2.Bf4**

I never considered the London as a serious opening until Carlsen started having great success with it back in 2015. I even picked it up myself and scored some nice wins with it in the process. Nowadays, the London is considered a mainstream opening, and it is popular at all levels.

**2...c5!**

The most aggressive way of tackling the London system, and also nicely in the spirit of the Tarrasch Defense. This early combative approach may take London players aback, as they usually strive for a slower game.

**3.e3 Nc6 4.Nf3 cxd4**

With this exchange we're heading for a Carlsbad structure.

**5.exd4 Bf5**

So, we have reached the typical Carlsbad structure, where White has the c- and d-pawns against our e- and d-pawns. Typically, we should use the minority attack later on with ...b7-b5-b4. While that way of playing is certainly decent, I tried to find a new way of approaching the position and casting some surprise value upon the opponent.

**6.c3 e6 7.Nbd2**

White simply develops in rudimentary London fashion.

**7...h5N**

If this doesn't surprise your opponent, I do not know what will. Besides the shock effect, the idea behind the move is to gain some space on the kingside, usually by following it up with ...f6 and ...g5 and therefore discourage the opponent from castling.

A similar version of this idea is 7...f6, which has been seen in some games, but in that case, 8.Nh4 is slightly awkward to meet.

**8.Bb5**

The most active square for the bishop, intending to play Ne5.

**8...f6**

Covering the e5-square, and at the same time preparing to push forward with ...g5!.

**9.h4**

The only way to stop our advances, but now the white kingside is weakened.

**9...Bd6 10.Bxd6 Qxd6**

We'll continue with ...Nge7 and our king will stand very well on f7.

The London is very popular at all levels, be sure to study the main course, where you will learn how to play against the 2.Bf4 System and the Jobava London.

## Jobava London 2.Nc3

**1.d4 d5 2.Nc3**

The Jobava London has become increasingly popular recently. Besides the creative genius of Baadur Jobava, both Simon Williams and Hans Niemann have created successful Chessable courses on the opening that have boosted the popularity even further.

Conventional wisdom holds that one should not place the knight on c3 before pushing the c-pawn to c4, but proponents of this variation have found ways to justify this way of playing. White will often aim to play for an early e2-e4, or start expanding on the kingside through f2-f3 and g2-g4.

**2...c5!**

2...Nf6 is the main move, but besides the Jobava London with 3.Bf4, there also exists the possibility of playing the Veresov Attack with 3.Bg5.

As I have stressed, our idea is to meet virtually every line except for 2.c4 with 2...c5. This is no exception. By immediately striking in the center, we severely limit White in their options.

**3.e4**

The only principled way of playing. White must strike back in the center.

**3...dxe4**

The pawn must be captured! At the same time, the d4-pawn is now hanging, so White must continue energetically.

**4.d5**

The only way to keep the game complicated. The advanced pawn takes control over a number of important squares.

**4...Nf6**

Sometimes, chess speaks for itself.

**5.Bf4**

An interesting option offered by Simon Williams in his course on the Jobava London. Simon is known for offering dangerous and creative opening ideas so we better have a close look at his suggestion.

**5...g6**

We have to develop the dark-squared bishop somehow, and this is the best way to do so. Although it allows some sharp play, there is no reason to fear as we are doing quite well in the complications.

**6.Nb5**

In his course, Simon offers this move, which indeed seems tempting. After a couple of accurate moves, White quickly runs out of tricks, though.

**6...Na6 7.d6**

White keeps going forward, which certainly is in the spirit of the opening. However, White lacks the development to sustain this kind of play.

**7...Be6**

Developing the light-squared bishop and creating the idea of ...Nd5. It is unclear how White can create any further threats and the engines already give Black a close-to-winning advantage of -1.20.

## 2.Nf3

**1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 c5!**

One of the great benefits of playing the Tarrasch is that virtually any other move than 2.c4 can be met by 2...c5. Especially after 2.Nf3, this is a great shortcut, avoiding loads of sidelines.

For example, many London players may wish to play 2.Nf3 and then 3.Bf4, but now they no longer have such an option.<addx start="3.Bf4"/>

Objectively, White's best move is 3.c4, but after 3...e6 we transpose back to the main body of the course. I recently was able to use this in my own practice when facing GM Tabatabaei from Iran in the 2022 Olympiad.

**3.e3**

A typical choice for those who like to play the Colle system.

**3...Nf6 4.c3**

We are now playing a reversed Slav Defense.

**4...e6**

There are many ways of developing. I quite like the plan of playing ...Nbd7, ...b6 and ...Be7, just getting a comfortable and equal game.

**5.Bd3 Nbd7 6.Nbd2 b6**

It is clever to develop the bishop to b7 as early as possible, dealing with any e3-e4 shenanigans.

**7.O-O Bb7 8.Qe2**

Still trying to get e3-e4 in.

**8...Ne4!?**

A way of keeping things spicy, not allowing the opponent to play e3-e4 at all. We will follow up by completing our kingside development, while it is not obvious for White to find a new plan.
