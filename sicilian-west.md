### (19) 2. Quickstarter - Westerinen Attack #1 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.b3**

Going for The Westerinen Attack! Usually you don't see the Bishop going to the a1-h8 diagonal in the Sicilian Defense when playing the White pieces, but against 2...e6 I think that 3.b3 is a nice line to play because Black can't challenge the Bishop. The reason why you are not seeing b3 lines against the Sicilian that often, is because Black can block the diagonal most of the times and kill your b2 Bishop, as for example let's say you are trying to do the same set-up against 2...d6 by going 3.b3 and in some cases it might transpose to our line, but the main issue is that Black gets the extra option to block the diagonal with 3...e5! The same reasoning applies against 2...Nc6, if you try 3.b3 Black has the strong 3...e5 blocking the b2 Bishop. Now that you understand what is the problem of the Queen-side Fianchetto against the other second moves, you can notice easier that the Bishop on b2 is having a good time against the 2...e6 Sicilian because Black is lacking a good way to block that strong piece.</skip>

**3...d6**

The point of this move is to prepare Nf6 without allowing White to get e5 with tempo. The drawback of d6 is that we are going to play e5 anyway and the support the e5 Knight with f4! Then White has an easy plan of developing the light squared Bishop to d3, and the bring the Knight over to c4 via a3. If Black really wants to avoid that, he must go for 4...e5, trying to block our b2 Bishop, but White end up on top after 5. Bb5+ with the simple and straightforward plan of going short castle, and c3-d4 to break the center.</skip>

**4.Bb2**

Developing the Bishop.</skip>

**4...Nc6**

This is also a very popular line for Black! The point is to play Nf6 next and prevent us from getting e5 and then to support the Knight with f4. It is a smart way for Black to avoid our e5 attacking line, but we have a surprisingly strong continuation here! We can just go for 5.d4! here, going for an Open Sicilian position with the simple and straightforward plan of going Nc3-Qd2-O-O-O and push the King-side pawns!</skip>

**5.d4**

We are entering a favorable variation of the Open Sicilian. This is resembling the modern system with 2.Nc3 and Qxd4-Qd2 and b3-Bb2, O-O-O, that is now very popular against the Najdorf.</skip>

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.b3**

**4...Nf6**

The main move for this move order. Black simply wants to play Be7 and castle short.</skip>

The point of this line! We are not going to allow Black to get away with it.</skip>

**5...dxe5 6.Nxe5**

Recapturing the pawn.</skip>

**6...Nbd7 7.f4**

The big point of the line, not allowing Black to simply trade our strong Knight and then finish his development easily. If Black really wants to get rid of our Knight now, he has to bring our pawn to the e5 square, taking away the f6 square of the Knight, and give us attacking chances on the King-side. If Black does not take the e5 Knight, we are going to develop our light squared Bishop on d3, bring the Knight to c4 via a3, and depending on the exact situation, O-O with the famous Rook lift Rf3-Rh3 should give us strong attack.</skip>

**7...Be7 8.Bd3**

White's Bishops are ready to hunt the King-side.</skip>

### (21) 2. Quickstarter - Westerinen Attack #3 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.b3**

**3...d5**

It is a very principled approach by Black to play in the center because our previous move is a little bit slow. Nevertheless, we are happy to see this move on the board because we are going to have an Isolated Queen's Pawn type of position, where we get to trade the light-squared Bishops with 5.Bb5+! Trading the light-squared Bishops is helping White a lot because the isolated pawn on d5 will be much weaker without Black having a Bishop on e6 to defend it. Black can try to avoid this scenario by going 5...Nc6, and not trade the Bishops, but then he is running into concrete problems after the annoying check 6.Qe2+! You have to be careful with the move orders as White, but I think the reward is good enough if you do it.</skip>

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.b3**

**3...b6**

Is what the stronger players are doing. I doubt that you will encounter this line if your opponent is under 2000 level. The point of this move is to play Bb7 next, making it awkward for White to defend the e4 pawn. This is a subtle move, and is going to be played only by a well-prepared opponent. The big advantage is that even strong Grandmasters are not always going for what I consider to be Black's best chance! Okay, now what if Black goes for it? I recommend you to open up the position with 4.d4 on the next move, and after 4...cxd4 5.Nxd4 Bb7 I managed to come up with a new way of handling this line: 6.Nd2!?</skip>

**4.d4**

Opening up the position. The point is to have Nd2 when Black plays Bb7.</skip>

**4...cxd4 5.Nxd4**

Recapturing the pawn.</skip>

**5...Bb7**

By far the most natural, and the most played move in this position.</skip>

**6.Nd2**

My fresh approach of the position! Everyone used to play 6.Bd3 in this position, but that would have allowed Black to go for the line with 6...Bc5 7. Bb2 and now Black has the strong 7...Qf6! forcing White to play the awkward move 8.c3 to defend the Knight. So what is the difference between 6.Bd3 and 6. Nd2 you may be asking yourself? The ideas behind 6.Nd2 are pretty similar to 6. Bd3 if Black plays normal developing moves, White gets a comfortable game with moves such as: Bb2-Bd3-O-O-f4, and maybe even c4 is nice sometimes to set-up the ''Hedgehog structure''. As a rule of thumb whenever Black plays Nc6 we are replying with Nxc6 to open up the diagonal of the b2 Bishop. Now the big difference is that none of this would be possible as i mentioned earlier, because Black can go for 7...Qf6! and kill the 6.Bd3 line. If Black tries to to the same against 6.Nd2, let's say 6...Bc5, we defend the Knight with 7.Bb2 and if Black tries to go for the same 7...Qf6, this is no longer effective because White has the extra option of going 8.Nc4! with initiative.</skip>

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.b3**

Goi@g for The Westerinen Attack! Usually you don't see the Bishop going to the a1-h8 diagonal in the Sicilian Defense when playing the White pieces, but against 2...e6. I think that 3.b3 is a nice line to play because Black can't challenge the Bishop. The reason why you are not seeing b3 lines against the Sicilian that often, is because Black can block the diagonal most of the times and kill your b2 Bishop. As for example, let's say you are trying to do the same set-up against rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 by going 3.b3 . In some cases, it might transpose to our line, but the main issue is that Black gets the extra option to block the diagonal with 3...e5! The same reasoning applies against rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 , if you try 3.b3 Black has the strong 3...e5 blocking the b2 Bishop. Now that you understand what is the problem of the Queen-side fianchetto against the other second moves, you can notice easier that the Bishop on b2 is having a good time against the 2...e6 Sicilian because Black is lacking a good way to block that strong piece.</skip>

So what is the difference between 6.Bd3 and 6.Nd2 you may be asking yourself? The ideas behind 6.Nd2 are pretty similar to 6.Bd3 if Black plays normal developing moves, White gets a comfortable game with moves such as Bb2-Bd3-O-O-f4, and maybe even c4 is nice sometimes to set-up the ''Hedgehog structure''. As a rule of thumb whenever Black plays Nc6 we are replying with Nxc6 to open up the diagonal of the b2 Bishop. Now the big difference is that none of this would be possible as I mentioned earlier, because Black can go for 7...Qf6! and kill the 6.Bd3 line. If Black tries to the same against 6.Nd2, let's say 6...Bc5, we defend the Knight with 7.Bb2 and if Black tries to go for the same 7...Qf6, this is no longer effective because White has the extra option of going 8.Nc4! with initiative.</skip>

Whi@e will castle long next, and Black's Queen is in trouble. 0-1 (67) Bochkarev,A (2361)-Voicu Jagodzinsky,C (2205) Bucharest 2001</skip>

**10...Qh6**

Is Black's best reply. This is a new position though, so I expect to see more games with this line in the future. Black's position is not that bad with engine precision, but playing this way unprepared can lead to very bad things very quickly.</skip>

**11.Qe2**

Developing the Queen, defending the e4 pawn.</skip>

**11...O-O 12.f4**

Gaining some space, preparing O-O-O.</skip>

Sidestepping the attack of the Bishop.</skip>

Sidestepping the attack of the Knight.</skip>

**16...Nb4 17.Ne5**

Preparing to recapture on d3 with the Knight.</skip>

**17...Nxd3+ 18.Nxd3**

Recapturing the piece, preparing long castle.</skip>

**18...Be4 19.O-O-O**

Black's Queen is misplaced, and White has easier play with the strong Bishop on b2.</skip>

White is better because the enemy Queen is misplaced, and White has attacking potential on the King-side once he starts pushing the pawns.</skip>

**6.Nd2**

**6...Bc5**

**7.Bb2**

**7...Nh6**

The@funny story about this line is that I knew it's a thing because the engine likes it, but I thought I should not introduce it in the course since it's a weird engine move and there are no games with it, however a little bit later the Taimanov course for Black by Harikrishna Pentala came up (which I definitely encourage you to have a look on) and his suggestion against the Westerinen Attack is this exact line with 7...Nh6, but the general idea is that our set-up must be pretty decent if Black has to come up with such sophisticated moves in order to get a decent position.</skip>

**8.Qe2**

Is not given by Pentala, but I think it's in the spirit of the Westerinen Attack! We are going to castle long and I think that overall the h6 Knight might not be everyone's cup of tea.</skip>

**8...e5**

Comes to mind because it's natural for Black to get rid of White's strong Knight from d4.</skip>

**9.Nf5**

White had a variety of options here, but I came to the conclusion that this is the most practical move! This does not seem very logical because we are trading Black's Knight from h6, but on the other hand we are forcing some complications that should turn out well for us.</skip>

**9...Nxf5 10.exf5 O-O**

Black is offering a poisoned pawn, but we are not interested to take it before castling!</skip>

**11.O-O-O**

Now we are threatening to take e5 for real, so Black has to defend it.</skip>

**11...f6**

The logical way to defend the pawn, restricting White's Bishop on b2.</skip>

**12.f4**

Of course! We are challenging Black's blockade immediately! Black has two options here:</skip>

**12...exf4**

Is creating an isolated pawn for Black.</skip>

**13.Qc4+ d5 14.Qxf4 Nc6**

Would allow White:</skip>

**15.Ne4**

White is threatening to take on d5!</skip>

**13.Qc4+ d5 14.Qxf4 Na6**

Black has to be careful with his development!</skip>

**15.Ne4 Qc7**

Black has to bail out with this endgame:</skip>

**16.Qxc7 Nxc7**

Would be very inaccurate because:</skip>

**17.Nxc5 bxc5 18.Ba3**

White wins the c5 pawn.</skip>

**12.f4**

**12...exf4**

**13.Qc4+ d5 14.Qxf4 Na6**

**15.Ne4 Qc7**

Black has to bail out and try to hold this endgame:</skip>

**16.Qxc7 Be3+**

An important resource for Black!</skip>

**17.Kb1 Nxc7 18.Ng3 Rfe8 19.Be2 Bc5 20.Bf3**

White has pressure on the isolani.</skip>

**9...Nxf5 10.exf5 O-O**

**11.O-O-O**

**11...f6**

**12.f4**

**12...Nc6**

This should be Black's best line objectively, but I think White gets very interesting play with the following exchange sacrifice:</skip>

**13.Ne4**

I think this is the best practical chance, forcing Black to play Nd4 otherwise his position becomes critical.</skip>

**13...exf4**

Gives White a big edge already:</skip>

**14.Nxc5 bxc5 15.Qb5 Rb8 16.Qxc5**

The Bishop Pair and the weak pawn on d7 are securing a solid edge for White.</skip>

### (660) 13. Westerinen-Attack Part I - 6.Nd2 Bc5 7.Bb2 Nh6 #5

**13.Ne4**

**13...exf4**

**14.Nxc5 bxc5 15.Qb5 Qb6 16.Rxd7**

White has the Bishop Pair and is very active.</skip>

### (661) 13. Westerinen-Attack Part I - 7.Bb2 Nh6 Sacrifice the exchan

**11.O-O-O**

**11...f6**

**12.f4**

**12...Nc6**

**13.Ne4**

**13...Nd4**

At first, this looks very problematic for us, but I found a very good practical chance:</skip>

**14.Bxd4 Bxd4**

The Bishop on d4 looks very scary but White has the following strong sequence of moves:</skip>

**15.Nd6 Qb8**

This is an improved version of Qc7, but White has the same exchange sacrifice available:</skip>

**16.Rxd4 exd4 17.Qc4+ Kh8 18.Qxd4**

White has the simple plan of Rg1-g4-g5, while it's not clear what is Black going to do with the extra exchange.</skip>

### (662) 13. Westerinen-Attack Part I - 7.Bb2 Nh6 Sacrifice the exchan

**12...Nc6**

**13.Ne4**

**13...Nd4**

**14.Bxd4 Bxd4**

Would be an easy way to lose the game on the spot:</skip>

**16.Qc4+**

White wins a piece.</skip>

### (663) 13. Westerinen-Attack Part I - 7.Bb2 Nh6 Sacrifice the exchan

**12...Nc6**

**13.Ne4**

**13...Nd4**

**14.Bxd4 Bxd4**

**15.Nd6 Bc6 16.Rxd4**

This exchange sacrifice is giving White very interesting play:</skip>

**16...exd4 17.Qc4+ Kh8 18.Qxd4**

White has the simple and strong plan of going Rg1-g4-g5, while Black can't use his extra exchange because the Knight is controlling both entry squares on to the open files!</skip>

### (664) 13. Westerinen-Attack Part I - 14. Bxd4 exd4

**11...f6**

**12.f4**

**12...Nc6**

**13.Ne4**

**13...Nd4**

**14.Bxd4 exd4**

Would allow White to win material:</skip>

**15.Nxc5 bxc5 16.Qc4+**

White is picking up two pawns with a winning position.</skip>

### (665) 13. Westerinen-Attack Part I - Transposition 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.b3**

**3...b6**

**4...cxd4 5.Nxd4 Bb7**

**6.Nd2**

**6...Bc5**

**7.Bb2**

**7...Nh6**

**8.Qe2**

**8...O-O 9.O-O-O e5**

Will be a transposition:</skip>

**10.Nf5 Nxf5 11.exf5 f6 12.f4**

Is transposing to8...e5.</skip>

### (666) 13. Westerinen-Attack Part I - 9.O-O-O Nc6 #1

**6.Nd2**

**6...Bc5**

**7.Bb2**

**7...Nh6**

**8.Qe2**

**8...O-O 9.O-O-O Nc6**

I'm guessing that this could be played more often by Black because it's simpler and not a lot of people would enter the complications without being sure that it's safe.</skip>

**10.Nxc6**

As usual, against the b6 line we take on c6 whenever we can.</skip>

**10...Bxc6 11.Nf3**

The Knight is going to d4.</skip>

**11...a5**

Black can get the initiative if we allow a4, so we are going to reply with:</skip>

**12.a4 Qe7 13.Nd4 Ba3 14.f3**

A very useful move, keeping a solid center, and potentially following up with some English Attack type of play with a King-side storm.</skip>

**14...f6 15.Kb1 Bxb2 16.Kxb2 Nf7 17.Rd2**

Preparing to double our Rook on the d file.</skip>

**17...Qc5 18.Qf2 Nd6 19.Nb5**

Forcing a pleasant endgame for White:</skip>

**19...Qxf2 20.Rxf2 Bxb5 21.Bxb5 Nxb5 22.axb5**

White has pressure on the d7 pawn and also the b6 pawn could be a target.</skip>

Preparing to meet d5 with:</skip>

**11...Qe7 12.Nd4 Rad8 13.g3**

Simply developing the Bishop.</skip>

**13...Ba3 14.Bg2 e5**

Black has to block the center to not allow us to expand.</skip>

**15.Nxc6 dxc6 16.Bh3**

We have a symmetrical position with the Bishop better than the Knight.</skip>

**11...Qe7 12.Nd4 Ba3 13.Kb1 Bxb2 14.Kxb2 Rac8 15.g4**

I simply find it tough for Black to play with such a Knight on the rim.</skip>

**15...f6 16.h4 Nf7 17.Nxc6 Rxc6 18.Rh3**

White is using the fact that he has extra space:</skip>

**18...Rfc8 19.c3**

Pushing f4-g5 next, White has a pleasant position.</skip>

### (671) 13. Westerinen-Attack Part I - 6.Nd2 Nf6 #1

White has more space, and is pressing on d7.</skip>

**16...Qd7 17.Rfd1**

White will attack on the King-side because the e5 pawn is helping us to attack because there is no Knight on f6.</skip>

My fresh approach of the position! Everyone used to play 6.Bd3 in this position, but that would have allowed Black to go for the line with 6...Bc5 7.Bb2 and now Black has the strong 7...Qf6! forcing White to play the awkward move 8.c3 to defend the Knight.So what is the difference between 6.Bd3 and 6.Nd2 you may be asking yourself? The ideas behind 6.Nd2 are pretty similar to 6.Bd3 if Black plays normal developing moves, White gets a comfortable game with moves such as: Bb2-Bd3-O-O-f4, and maybe even c4 is nice sometimes to set-up the ''Hedgehog structure''. As a rule of thumb whenever Black plays Nc6 we are replying with Nxc6 to open up the diagonal of the b2 Bishop.Now the big difference is that none of this would be possible as i mentioned earlier, because Black can go for 7...Qf6! and kill the 6.Bd3 line.If Black tries to to the same against 6.Nd2, let's say 6...Bc5, we defend the Knight with 7.Bb2 and if Black tries to go for the same 7...Qf6, this is no longer effective because White has the extra option of going 8.Nc4! with initiative.</skip>

Going for The Westerinen Attack! Usually you don't see the Bishop going to the a1-h8 diagonal in the Sicilian Defense when playing the White pieces, but against 2...e6 I think that 3.b3 is a nice line to play because Black can't challenge the Bishop. The reason why you are not seeing b3 lines against the Sicilian that often, is because Black can block the diagonal most of the times and kill your b2 Bishop, for example, let's say you are trying to do the same set-up against 2...d6 by going 3.b3 and in some cases it might transpose to our line, but the main issue is that Black gets the extra option to block the diagonal with 3...e5! The same reasoning applies against 2...Nc6, if you try 3.b3 Black has the strong 3...e5 blocking the b2 Bishop. Now that you understand what is the problem of the Queen-side fianchetto against the other second moves, you can notice easier that the Bishop on b2 is having a good time against the 2...e6 Sicilian because Black is lacking a good way to block that strong piece.</skip>

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.b3**

**3...Nc6**

The@point of this move is to get an improved version of 3...d5 because now White has to play 4.Bb2 and then the point of Black is to go 4...d5!? If we compare this with the lines starting with 3...d5, to gain an advantage, White was postponing Bb2 for a while, and the main problem for Black was 4.exd5 exd5 5.Bb5+ threatening to trade the light squared Bishops, and if Black goes 5...Nc6 White had the strong 6.Qe2+, creating a mess in Black's camp.It is very important to understand those aspect to not confuse the positions with one another.The good new is that White has a very dangerous pawn sacrifice at his disposal!The problem for Black in this line is that White will play 4.Bb2 and now against 4...d5 (trying to trick us with the move-order) White has the option of going for 5. Bb5! offering the e4 pawn in exchange of Ne5 ideas, exploiting the pin!</skip>

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.b3**

**3...a6**

The@standard Paulsen move, not really influencing the situation in the center, but a small useful move, taking away the b5 square. The independent value comes if Black decides to enter the Isolated Queen's Pawn (IQP) positions by going for 4...d5. I think those lines are objectively good for Black, but quite risky strategically speaking because the Isolated Pawn can become weak if not played properly. If Black goes for 4...Nc6, we have the important 5.Qe2! stopping Black from going d5, and the next step for White is to finish his development by going g3-Bg2 and castle short. As a game plan, White should be always looking to open up the position because the Fianchetto Bishops will become very active and controlling a lot of squares.</skip>

**4.Bb2 d5**

Is leading to IQP positions that are fine for Black on the engine, but strategically dangerous in long term.Also the Paulsen players love to have a flexible pawn structure, so going for this, would not really suit the majority of the Paulsen guys out there.</skip>

The idea is to stop Black from playing d5! Compare this to3...Nc6 4.Bb2 d5, now White has the strong 5.Bb5! , note that in our case Black has a6 on the board, so Bb5 is not an option anymore, so we have to come up with a way to discourage Black from pushing d5.</skip>

### (712) 14. Westerinen-Attack Part II - 4.Bb2 Nc6 #1 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.b3**

**3...d6**

The point of this move is to prepare Nf6 without allowing White to get e5 with tempo. The drawback of d6 is that we are going to play e5 anyway and the support the e5 Knight with f4! Then White has an easy plan of developing the light-squared Bishop to d3, and the bring the Knight over to c4 via a3. If Black really wants to avoid that, he must go for 4...e5 , trying to block our b2 Bishop, but White end up on top after 5.Bb5+ with the simple and straightforward plan of going short castle, and c3-d4 to break the center.</skip>

**4.Bb2**

**4...Nc6**

This is also a very popular line for Black! The point is to play Nf6 next and prevent us from getting e5 and then to support the Knight with f4. It is a smart way for Black to avoid our e5 attacking line, but we have a surprisingly strong continuation here! We can just go for 5.d4! here, going for an Open Sicilian position with the simple and straightforward plan of going Nc3-Qd2-O-O-O and pushing the King-side pawns!</skip>

**5.d4**

Recapturing the Knight.</skip>

**9...Qa5 10.Be2**

I like this move because we are preparing O-O-O, without allowing any Ng4 ideas, and the Bishop is also supporting a future attack with g2-g4.</skip>

**10...Bd7 11.O-O-O**

The King is very safe on the Queen-side with that Bishop on b2.</skip>

**11...Rc8 12.Kb1**

Always play Kb1!</skip>

**12...Qc5 13.Qd3**

We are keeping the Queens on the board because we are trying to play for a mating attack.</skip>

Would be exactly what we are looking for because we have:</skip>

Suddenly Black's King is very exposed!</skip>

A very nice positional move, sidestepping from the a8-h1 diagonal, and also defending the c2 pawn just in case. Now the Rook is useful in the attack but also in defending the Queen-side. I think it's fair to say that this Rook is the guardian of the position.</skip>

White is going to win back the pawn, with a better position:</skip>

Attacking the d6 pawn, and pinning the e5 one.</skip>

**14...Rad8 15.Bxc6 bxc6 16.Nxe5**

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.b3**

The main move for this move order.Black simply wants to play Be7 and castle short.</skip>

**5.e5**

**5...dxe5 6.Nxe5**

I don't think this move really helps Black since White is doing the same: f4, Bd3, Na3-c4, O-O, Qe2.</skip>

**3...d6**

**4.Bb2**

**4...Nf6**

**5.e5**

**5...dxe5 6.Nxe5**

**6...Nbd7 7.f4**

The big point of the line, not allowing Black to simply trade our strong Knight and then finish his development easily. If Black really wants to get rid of our Knight now, he has to bring our pawn to the e5 square, taking away the f6 square of the Knight, and giving us attacking chances on the King-side. If Black does not take the e5 Knight, we are going to develop our light-squared Bishop to d3, bring the Knight to c4 via a3, and depending on the exact situation, O-O with the famous Rook lift Rf3-Rh3 should give us strong attack.</skip>

Some of the Black players might try to hunt the d3 Bishop.</skip>

**11.Na3**

Developing the Knight, acting like nothing strange will happen if Black goes Nb4 next.</skip>

**11...Nb4**

But now we can play:</skip>

**12.Bxh7+**

Sacrificing the Bishop to bring the Queen to the King-side with tempo.</skip>

White's attack is virtually unstoppable.</skip>

Taking away the h5 square.</skip>

Forcing the King to g8.</skip>

**14...Kg8 15.Qe1**

Threatening to play Qh4.</skip>

**15...Nh7 16.Qe2**

Threatening Qh5, winning a square little by little.</skip>

**17...Nh7 18.Qf3**

Threatening Qh5.</skip>

**18...Nf6 19.Qg3**

Threatening Qh4.</skip>

**19...Nh7**

Now after the Queen dance, we can go no further, but notice that now the Queen is watching the g7 square!</skip>

**20.Nb5**

So after whatever square Black will choose for the Queen we will move away the e5 Knight, attacking the enemy Queen, and threatening to mate on g7.</skip>

White is going to play Qh4 and bring the Knight to the King-side via e3-g4.</skip>

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.b3**

**3...d5**

Is a very principled approach by Black to play in the center because our previous move is a little bit slow. Nevertheless we are happy to see this move on the board because we are going to have an Isolated Queen's Pawn type of positions, where we get to trade the light squared Bishops with 5.Bb5+! Trading the light squared Bishops is helping White a lot, because the isolated pawn on d5 will be much weaker without Black having a Bishop on e6 to defend it.Black can try to avoid this scenario by going 5...Nc6, and not trade the Bishops, but then he is running into concrete problems after the annoying check 6.Qe2+! You have to be careful with the move orders as White, but i think the reward is good enough if you do it.</skip>

White has two Rooks and a pawn for the Queen. I think White is quite happy here because of the healthy pawn structure and the material balance that is in his favor.</skip>

Attacking the weak e6 pawn.</skip>

Whi@e has the Bishop Pair, and a safer King. The French structure (d5-e6) is also not impressive, since White will try to get the Knight to e5 via f3.</skip>

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.b3**

**3...Nf6**

Is occasionally played, Black's point is to attack the e4 pawn as early as possible, and not to allow White any early tricks.The line is solid for Black, in a way that he will develop his pieces without much trouble, but White should be better with the extra space.Now White is forced to go for 4.e5 - Grabbing space and attcking the Knight, because there is no other good way to defend the e4 pawn.After Black goes 4...Nd5 we are finishing the Queen-side Fianchetto by playing 5.Bb2 and now on the most natural move 5...Nc6 you need to remember that the best place for the light squared Bishop is on the h1-a8 diagonal, so White should play 6.g3! preparing the King-side Fianchetto with a nice control over the center assured by the double Fianchetto.</skip>
