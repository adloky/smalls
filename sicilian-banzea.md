### (4) 2. Quickstarter - Hungarian Variation #1 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

The most popular reply to 2.Nf3 , Black is setting up a bunch of strong Sicilians such as: The Najdorf Sicilian, The Dragon Sicilian and the Classical Sicilian. I decided to tackle these bulls with the Hungarian Variation that is arising after 3.d4 cxd4 and now the Queen recapture 4.Qxd4!? .<addz start="3.d4"/>

**3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4**

Going for the Hungarian Variation! This used to be played from time to time by very strong Grandmasters, but mostly used as a surprise weapon. The traditional way of playing this line is to pin the Knight with Bb5. In the late part of 2018, the second best Indian player Pentala Harikrishna started to implement the original idea with 5.Qe3 that is our main focus of the repertoire. It might seem odd at first, but White's play is fairly simple and straightforward looking to rush Be2, O-O, h3 and Rd1 threatening to play e5.<addz start="5.Qe3"/>

**4...Nc6**

The principled move, attacking the early developed Queen.

**5.Qe3**

The Harikrishna Variation! The second best rated Indian player after the former World Champion Vishy Anand, not only introduced this line back in the second half of 2018 in his game from the third round of the Batumi Olympiad against the young Canadian Grand Master Razvan Preotu, but he repeated the line no less than 8 times! The point of Qe3 is to stay flexible and rush Be2, short castle, h3 and Rd1. After that we will see how Black is going to react and choose our plan accordingly.

**5...Nf6 6.Be2 e6 7.O-O Be7 8.Rd1**

Keeping an eye on the slightly weak d6 pawn.

**8...O-O 9.c4**

Entering the Hedgehog is always pleasant for White, since it will be really tough for Black to ever deliver any pawn breaks.

**9...Qc7 10.Nc3 a6 11.b3 b6 12.Ba3**

Increasing the pressure on the backward d6 pawn.

**12...Bb7 13.Rac1**

Threatening to jump with the Knight on d5!

**13...Rfe8 14.Nd5**

Would show White's idea:

**14...exd5 15.cxd5**

White is going to win back the piece with a better position.

### (5) 2. Quickstarter - Hungarian Variation #2 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4**

**4...Nc6**

**5.Qe3**

**5...Nf6 6.Be2 e6 7.O-O Be7 8.Rd1**

**8...O-O 9.c4**

**9...Qc7 10.Nc3 a6 11.b3 b6 12.Ba3**

**12...Bb7 13.Rac1**

**13...Nb8**

had to be played in order to not run into Nd5.

**14.e5**

Perfect timing to open up the position since Black is under developed and White has all the pieces ready to jump in to the action!

**14...dxe5 15.Bxe7 Qxe7 16.Nxe5**

Makes it really tough for Black to finish his development.

### (6) 2. Quickstarter - Hungarian Variation #3 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4**

**4...Nc6**

**5.Qe3**

**5...Nf6 6.Be2 g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.h3**

Stopping any Bg4/Ng4 ideas.

**8...O-O 9.Rd1 Nd7 10.Nc3 Qb6**

Is not really stopping our plan:

**11.Qf4**

Preparing to swing the Queen to h4.

**11...Nde5 12.Nd5 Qd8 13.Nxe5 Nxe5 14.Qh4**

White is better here because Bishop to g5 is the next move, forcing Black to weaken himself by playing f6, after which White can simply retreat the Bishop to e3, and have a much easier game with the locked Black Bishop on g7.

### (7) 2. Quickstarter - Hungarian Variation #4 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4**

**4...Nc6**

**5.Qe3**

**5...Nf6 6.Be2 g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.h3**

**8...O-O 9.Rd1 Nd7 10.Nc3 b6**

Trying to develop the Queen-side.

**11.b3**

This move has been played successfully by Anton Demchenko against one of the biggest experts of the Sicilian from the Black side, Alexei Sarana. The point is to develop the Bishop to b2, and after defending it with the move Rb1, White can jump on d5 with the Knight, putting annoying pressure on Black's position.

**11...Bb7 12.Bb2 Rc8 13.a3**

Stopping any Nb4 ideas.

**13...a6 14.Rab1**

Protects the Bishop while getting ready to jump with the Knight to d5.

**14...b5 15.Nd5**

Activating the Knight and trading the very active Bishop from g7. After trading that Bishop White's potential of an attack is increasing a lot. I like White's Queen here because from e3 it can either go to the King-side, but is also keeping an eye on the enemy Queen-side.

**15...Bxb2 16.Rxb2**

White has attacking potential on the King-side.

### (8) 2. Quickstarter - Accelerated Dragon #1 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

Going for the Accelerated Dragon! From my experience, the Black players are one-trick pony of this opening and they know it very well. Thinking about the fact that you are going to face this opening less often than 2...Nc6 and 2...d6 it makes sense to recommend a line that is easy to play for White as you don't rely on move-by-move stuff that much. This is the most common move order for the Accelerated Dragon. Black can start by going 2...Nc6 and only after 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 to go for the King-side fianchetto with 4...g6 . This move order has the plus that it avoid the line that I am going to suggest for White but the drawback that it allows the Rossolimo (3.Bb5). So it doesn't really matter what move order Black plays, you will be prepared against both.

**3.d4 Bg7**

This move is an interesting sideline, but is mostly played as a surprise weapon. White has more than one way to gain a pleasant position, that is why a lot of players don't bother with it that much, but I found a really nice idea that questions Black's whole set-up!

**4.dxc5**

If Black wants to recapture the pawn, White will gain a lot of tempi attacking the Queen. In my opinion this move is the best objectively speaking and if Black is not careful, White can gain a huge attack right away.

**4...Qa5+**

Is the most common move, trying to recapture the pawn.

**5.c3 Qxc5 6.Na3**

They tell you never put your Knight on the rim (a good general rule), but here we see how modern chess works. We don't think about it this way here, we are thinking one step ahead and we see that the Knight is going to b5, from where it is creating a lot of pressure on the Queen-side and it can harm Black's development!

**6...Nf6 7.Nb5 b6**

Black is making room for the Queen to hide on b7.

**8.b4**

The move order is important, since if you go e5 first, Black will have the option of going Ng4 threatening to mate you on f2!

**8...Qc6 9.e5 Ne4 10.Nfd4**

Notice how White is taking advantage of the early Queen development by Black! White is gaining a lot of tempi, and grabs the initiative while developing his pieces attacking Black's Queen.

**10...Qb7 11.Bd3**

Another move with tempo since White is threatening Qe2. Notice how the ''well placed central Knight'' is actually a weakness in Black's position!

**11...d5 12.f3 a6 13.fxe4 dxe4 14.Bc2**

Notice that White is not worried about b5 pawn, and decides to focus on the weak e4 pawn!

**14...axb5 15.O-O**

White has a lead in development.

### (9) 2. Quickstarter - Accelerated Dragon #2 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

Going for the Accelerated Dragon! From my experience, the Black players are one trick-pony of this opening and they know it very well. Thinking about the fact that you are going to face this opening less often than 2...Nc6 and 2...d6 it makes sense to recommend a line that is easy to play for White and you don't rely on move by move stuff that much. This is the most common move order for the Accelerated Dragon. Black can start by going 2...Nc6 and only after 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 to go for the King-side fianchetto with 4...g6 . This move order has the plus that it avoid the line that i am going to suggest for White but the drawback that it allows the Rossolimo (3. Bb5). So it doesn't really matter what move order Black plays, you will be prepared against both.

**3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4**

This line was known to be harmless for Black after 4...Nf6 5.e5, Black has enough counterplay after the move 5...Nc6, White can try to continue with 6.Qa4 Nd5 7.Qe4 but Black has been doing more than okay after the move 7...Nb6. This used to be the old main line, but nowadays White found out that the move 5.Nc3, staying flexible is leading to a positional game when White usually grabs the Bishop Pair, or if Black wants to avoid the positional squeeze he is supposed to sacrifice a pawn with 8...Bg7!? but this does not guarantee him an equal game.<skip start="8...Bg7"/>

**4...Nf6 5.Nc3**

The modern approach, picked up by a lot of strong Grand Masters. Now White is threatening to play e5 and then if Nc6 happens, White can safely go for Qa4, and there will be no Nd5 available for Black now since we already developed our Knight to c3!

**5...Nc6 6.Qa4**

This is the key move! White is threatening to play e5 next, so to stop that, Black has to play 6...d6 (the other moves are just inferior) and we can take advantage of the pinned Knight by going 7.e5!

**6...d6**

Is the best way to play against White's threat of going e5.

**7.e5**

Taking advantage of the pin!

**7...dxe5**

The main move by far, I never really faced the alternatives, but I did analyze them in case you might face any.

**8.Nxe5**

Increasing the pressure on the pinned Knight.

**8...Bg7**

This is a pawn sacrifice, but Black has to be very precise in order to keep realistic compensation for the pawn! The toughest test for Black is the move 9.Bb5, taking the pawn with the Bishop. Then Black's best defense is to force the light-squared Bishops off with the move 11...Bd7! This is what the biggest expert of the line, Gadir Guseinov played as Black and managed to hold. It is important for Black to trade the light-squared Bishops because he can later use the light squares from the Queen-side to generate counterplay, especially the c4 square. Notice that if Black does not go for 11...Bd7 and plays 11...Rb8 instead, we are avoiding the Bishop trade! Nevertheless, I think White still keeps a small edge even in that case with precise play!<skip start="11...Bd7"/><skip start="11...Bd7"/><skip start="11...Rb8"/>

**9.Bb5**

It's better to develop first, and take on c6 with the Bishop!

**9...O-O 10.Nxc6 bxc6 11.Bxc6 Bd7**

Has been played by the biggest expert in this line, Gadir Guseinov because it's in Black's favor to force the trade of the light-squared Bishops.

**12.O-O Rc8 13.Bxd7 Qxd7 14.Qa6**

This move seems to give Black some headaches, it is not that simple for him if you keep the Queens on the board.

**14...Rb8 15.Rd1 Qf5 16.Qxa7 Qxc2 17.Qd4 Rfc8 18.a4**

White is better with the outside passer.

### (10) 2. Quickstarter - Accelerated Dragon #3 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

Going for the Accelerated Dragon! From my experience, the Black players are one-trick pony of this opening and they know it very well. Thinking about the fact that you are going to face this opening less often than 2...Nc6 and 2...d6 it makes sense to recommend a line that is easy to play for White and you don't rely on move by move stuff that much. This is the most common move order for the Accelerated Dragon. Black can start by going 2...Nc6 and only after 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 to go for the King-side fianchetto with 4...g6. This move order has the plus that it avoids the line that I am going to suggest for White, but the drawback that it allows the Rossolimo (3.Bb5). So it doesn't really matter what move order Black plays, you will be prepared against both.

**3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4**

This line was known to be harmless for Black after 4...Nf6 5.e5, Black has enough counterplay after the move 5...Nc6, White can try to continue with 6.Qa4 Nd5 7.Qe4 but Black has been doing more than okay after the move 7...Nb6. This used to be the old main line, but nowadays White found out that the move 5.Nc3, staying flexible is leading to a positional game when White usually grabs the Bishop Pair, or if Black wants to avoid the positional squeeze he is supposed to sacrifice a pawn with 8...Bg7!? but this does not guarantee him an equal game.<skip start="8...Bg7"/>

**4...Nf6 5.Nc3**

**5...Nc6 6.Qa4**

This is the key move! White is threatening to play e5 next, so to stop that, Black has to play 6...d6(the other moves are just inferior) and we can take advantage of the pinned Knight by going 7.e5!

**6...d6**

**7.e5**

**7...dxe5**

**8.Nxe5**

**8...Bd7**

The most played move in this position, but it gives White a pretty pleasant position with the Bishop Pair. Since the center is opened, the Bishops are a significant asset here because they can easily operate on both flanks while the Knight will be struggling.

**9.Nxd7**

Taking the Bishop Pair, and starting the positional grind!

**9...Qxd7 10.Be3**

The best square for the Bishop, and preparing to bring Rd1 with tempo.

**10...Bg7 11.Rd1 Qc8**

Seems to be the best square for the Queen. The point here is that 12.g3 is no longer effective because Black will castle short 12...O-O and after 13.Bg2 , Black has the strong reply 13...Ng4! attacking our Bishop, and creating a mess in our camp. So for this reason now we are playing with Be2, avoiding any Ng4 jumps.

**12.Be2 O-O 13.O-O a6 14.Qb3**

A prophylactic move, now that Black played a6, he might go for b5, so we are preparing to take advantage of an over extended Queen-side by going a4! If Black does not go for b5, then it's tough to find something to play for, and as White you can simply stay flexible and the Bishop Pair does the job for you.

**14...b5 15.a4**

Attacking the over-extended Queen-side.

### (118) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 7.b3 Be7 # 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

The most popular reply to 2.Nf3, Black is setting up a bunch of strong Sicilians such as: the Najdorf Sicilian, the Dragon Sicilian and the Classical Sicilian. I decided to tackle these bulls with the Hungarian Variation that is arising after 3.d4 cxd4 and now the Queen recapture 4.Qxd4!?<addz start="3.d4"/>

**3.d4 Nf6**

Black can go for this move order, although it's not played that often as the main move, it's still very playable forcing White to go Nc3. This usually does not change much, but especially against our Hungarian, it takes away some options: for example, now it doesn't make any sense to analyze any c4 ideas in the Main Line and set up the Maroczy Bind if Black can avoid it by playing the smart move order with 3...Nf6. This move order is avoiding the c4 ideas, but we can go for the main plan that I am recommending with Nc3 and most likely transpose to the Main Line.

**4.Nc3 cxd4 5.Qxd4**

Entering the Hungarian Variation, but with an early Nc3. By looking at the main lines, you can notice that we prefer to postpone this Nc3 move, and rush Be2-h3-O-O and Rd1 with the threat of going e5, and only after that we develop the Knight on c3. This might not be very relevant since there are big odds of just transposing to the Main Line, but I want you to pay attention because Black has a few extra options here.

**5...Nc6**

Black could have also gone 5...a6 or 5...Bd7 .The point of those moves is to play Nc6 without allowing White to pin the Knight with Bb5. I haven't included them here since it's not bothering us, for we are going for our plan with Be2, Qe3, O-O, h3, Rd1 and you can see that these moves are not particularly threatening us.

**6.Qe3**

Trying to play Be2, h3 and O-O with Rd1, transposing to the Main Line. Most often Black goes for 6...g6 here which is going to transpose to the Main Line, but let's see what happens if he tries to avoid it by playing 6...e6 or if he tries the early break in the center with 6...d5:

**6...e6 7.b3**

I like this move because it reminds me of theWesterinen Attack! White wants to castle Queen-side and then play Rg1 with the idea of g4, throwing those pawns on to the enemy King.

**7...Be7 8.Bb2 O-O 9.O-O-O a6 10.Rg1**

Preparing g4

**10...Ng4**

Black is trying to be annoying.

**11.Qe1 b5 12.h3 Nge5 13.Nxe5 Nxe5 14.f4 Qb6 15.fxe5**

Sacrificing the exchange, for positional domination!

**15...Qxg1 16.exd6 Bg5+ 17.Kb1**

White gets a very dangerous passer for the exchange and nice control over the position.

**17...Qe3 18.Qxe3**

We don't really mind the endgame, but you can avoid it by playing Be2 if you want.

**18...Bxe3 19.e5 Bb7 20.a4 b4 21.Ne2**

Black always has to worry about the d6-pawn, while White can slowly chip away his Queen-side.

### (119) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 7.b3 Be7 # 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**3.d4 Nf6**

**4.Nc3 cxd4 5.Qxd4**

**5...Nc6**

Black could have also gone 5...a6 or 5...Bd7. The point of those moves is to play Nc6 without allowing White to pin the Knight with Bb5. I haven't included them here since it's not bothering us because we are going for our plan with Be2, Qe3, O-O, h3, Rd1 and you can see that this moves are not particularly threatening us.

**6.Qe3**

**6...e6 7.b3**

**7...Be7 8.Bb2 O-O 9.O-O-O a6 10.Rg1**

**10...b5 11.g4 Nd7 12.g5 Qb6**

Black's only chance to avoid the mating attack is to trade Queens.

**13.Qxb6**

I think the endgames are nice for White though.

**13...Nxb6 14.h4 b4 15.Ne2 a5 16.Nh2**

White keeps the initiative on the King-side even without the Queens on the board!

### (120) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 7.b3 Be7 # 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**3.d4 Nf6**

**4.Nc3 cxd4 5.Qxd4**

**7...Be7 8.Bb2 O-O 9.O-O-O a6 10.Rg1**

**10...b5 11.g4 Nd7 12.g5 Qb6**

**13.Qxb6**

**13...Nxb6 14.h4 b4 15.Ne2 e5**

Trying to block the b2 Bishop.

**16.Ng3 Bg4 17.Be2**

Threatening to take on e5.

**17...f5**

Protects the Bishop on g4, and tries to make counterplay.

**18.Nxf5 Bxf5 19.exf5 Rxf5 20.Rge1**

The Rooks are watching the hanging pawns d6 and e5.

**20...Raf8 21.Nd2 d5 22.Bxa6**

Black's pawns are feeling very shaky here. The Bishop Pair is very strong in this scenario because a pawn race is likely to appear.

### (121) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 7.b3 d5 #1 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**3.d4 Nf6**

**4.Nc3 cxd4 5.Qxd4**

**5...Nc6**

**6.Qe3**

**6...e6 7.b3**

**7...d5**

Looks very tempting to at least try to exploit the e1-a5 diagonal! The problem for Black is that he is not developed enough for this and White will end up on top.

**8.exd5 Bb4**

Looked scary at first, but Black has no follow up after Bd2.

**9.Bd2 Bxc3 10.Qxc3**

Notice that Black can't take with the Knight on d5 because g7 will be hanging, and also taking with the Queen will allow White to develop with tempo, so he has to do the sad recapture:

**10...exd5 11.Bg5**

It might seem that Black can go for tricks, but we have to go a little bit deeper:

**11...O-O 12.Bxf6 Re8+**

Trying to take advantage of the King that is still in the center of the board.

**13.Be2 gxf6 14.Qd2**

Defending the Bishop, preparing to castle.

**14...Qe7**

This could have compensated for the ugly pawn structure if White didn't have:

**15.O-O**

Inviting Black to take on e2 because the Rook is unprotected on e8!

**15...Qxe2**

Would lose on the spot to:

**16.Rae1**

White will pick up the Rook with check.

### (122) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 7.b3 d5 #2 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**3.d4 Nf6**

**5...Nc6**

**6.Qe3**

**6...e6 7.b3**

**7...d5**

**8.exd5 Nxd5**

is more solid

**9.Nxd5 Qxd5 10.Bc4**

Developing with tempo.

**10...Qa5+ 11.Bd2 Bb4 12.c3**

Gaining some time by advancing our Queen-side majority.

**12...Be7 13.O-O O-O 14.b4 Qc7 15.Qe4**

White is better developed, with a possible plan being to go Ng5, trying to create some weaknesses, after which we could simply play Bb3 followed by Rad1 improving the position, and later we can start pushing our pawn majority on the Queen-side.

### (123) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 7.b3 d5 #3 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**3.d4 Nf6**

**7...d5**

**8.exd5 Nxd5**

**9.Nxd5 Qxd5 10.Bc4**

**10...Qc5 11.Qe4**

We can try to keep the Queens on the board here because we will win a few tempis by attacking Black's Queen.

**11...Qa5+ 12.Bd2 Bb4 13.Rd1**

We don't mind the a2 pawn!

**13...Bxd2+ 14.Rxd2 Qxa2 15.O-O Qa5 16.Rfd1**

White has huge compensation for the pawn, because Black can't really develop the Bishop, White is dominating the d-file, and can start playing on the King-side with moves such as Bd3, and h4.

### (124) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 6.Qe3 d5 # 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**3.d4 Nf6**

**4.Nc3 cxd4 5.Qxd4**

**5...Nc6**

**6.Qe3**

**6...d5**

Feels too early.

**7.exd5 Nxd5 8.Nxd5 Qxd5 9.Qb3**

This is the key move! Proposing a pleasant endgame for White.

**9...Qd8 10.Bg5**

Looks to be very tough to even develop here with Black.

### (125) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 6.Qe3 d5 #

**5...Nc6**

**6.Qe3**

**6...d5**

**7.exd5 Nxd5 8.Nxd5 Qxd5 9.Qb3**

**9...Qxb3**

I think it's even worse for Black if he avoid the trade:

**10.axb3**

Maybe it is not everyone's cup of tea to trade Queens this early, but the endgame is very nice!

**10...e5 11.c3**

Preparing b4, with an initiative on the Queen-side.

**11...f6 12.b4**

Taking space on the Queen-side.

**12...Be6 13.Nd2**

A strong maneuver to improve the Horsie. The Knight is heading to c4.

**13...Be7 14.b5 Nd8 15.Nc4 Bxc4**

Is a horrible strategical decision, Black will just have no control on the light squares whatsoever.

**16.Bxc4**

Is a strategical disaster, the Bishop will land on d5, the other Bishop goes to e3 and the Knight is just getting dominated with no counterplay.

### (126) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 6.Qe3 d5 # 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**11...f6 12.b4**

**12...Be6 13.Nd2**

**13...Be7 14.b5 Nd8 15.Nc4 Nf7 16.Nb6**

With a surprisingly fast attack on the Queen-side!

**16...Rb8 17.Rxa7 Nd6 18.Be3**

White is a pawn up and will try to finish development as fast as possible, and then push the Queen-side pawns.

### (127) 5. The Harikrishna System - Black avoids the Bb5 lines 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4**

Going for the Hungarian Variation! This used to be played from time to time by very strong Grand Masters, but mostly used as a surprise weapon. The traditional way of playing this line is to pin the Knight with Bb5, but only in the late part of 2018, the second best Indian player Harikrishna Pentala started to implement the original idea with 5.Qe3, which is our main focus of the repertoire. It might seem odd at first, but White's play is fairly simple and straightforward looking to rush Be2, O-O, h3 and Rd1 threatening to play e5.<addz start="5.Qe3"/>

**4...Nf6**

The point of this line is to delay the move Nc6 to avoid the Bb5 lines, but it doesn't affect us since we can carry on with our plan.

**5.Be2**

We are going to castle short, play h3 followed by Rd1 with a transposition most likely.

### (128) 5. The Harikrishna System - White can still transpose 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4**

**4...a6**

Is played to avoid the Bb5 system.

**5.Be2**

But we are going to castle short, play h3 followed by Rd1 with a transposition most likely.

### (129) 5. The Harikrishna System - 4...Bd7 is another way to avoi 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4**

**4...Bd7**

Preparing Nc6 without allowing us to go for the Bb5 lines.

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4**

**4...e5**

Is a way for Black to attack the Queen without allowing White to pin the Knight with Bb5, but it is not really effective against us since we were going for Qe3 anyway. The problem for Black is that we are going to set-up the Maroczy bind with c4 and Black will have little to no counterplay.

**5.Qe3 Nf6 6.Be2 Be7 7.O-O O-O 8.c4**

Fixing the backward pawn on d6.

**8...Nc6 9.Nc3 Be6 10.b3 Qb8 11.Qd3 Nd7 12.Ng5**

Going for the Bishop Pair.

**12...Nc5 13.Qg3 Nd4 14.Nxe6 fxe6 15.Bg4**

Targeting the weakness from e6.

**15...Qe8 16.b4 Na6 17.Nb5**

Getting rid of the strong Knight that is defending the e6 pawn.

**17...Nxb4 18.Nxd4 exd4 19.Bxe6+ Kh8 20.Bd2 Na6 21.Bd5**

White had a dominant Bishop on d5 and went on to win in the game.

### (131) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 6.Be2 Bg4 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4**

**4...Nc6**

**5.Qe3**

The Harikrishna Variation! The second best rated Indian player after the former World Champion Vishy Anand, not only introduced this line back in the second half of 2018 in his game from the third round of the Batumi Olympiad against young Canadian Grand Master Razvan Preotu, but he repeated the line no less than 8 times! The point of Qe3 is to stay flexible and rush Be2, O-O, h3 and Rd1. After that we will see how Black is going to react and choose our plan accordingly.

**5...Nf6 6.Be2 Bg4**

Black tries to trade off the Bishop because if White gets to play h3, the c8 Bishop always gets a little akward since White has a space advantage.The downside of this is that White will get the Bishop Pair and keep a small but stable edge.

**7.O-O e6**

Going for the Hedgehog, as a general rule for White you have to watch out for Blacks pawn breaks: b5 and d5. If you can keep that under control, you will always be better as White, since Black has a weak pawn on d6.

**8.Rd1**

Is always a good move, keeping an eye on d6.

**8...Qb8 9.c4**

Setting up the Hedgehog structure!

**9...Be7 10.Nc3 O-O 11.b3**

Defending the c4 pawn, and keeping options available for the c1 Bishop.

**11...Bd8 12.Qd3 Bb6**

Black is offering a poisoned pawn on d6, but we are ignoring it with:

**13.Bg5**

Threatening to ruin Black's structure on the King-side.

**13...Qd8 14.Qxd6**

Now we can capture the pawn because there are no tricks!

**14...Qxd6 15.Rxd6 Ba5 16.Bxf6 gxf6 17.Na4**

White is up a pawn.

### (132) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 6.Be2 Bg4

**4...Nc6**

**5.Qe3**

**5...Nf6 6.Be2 Bg4**

**7.O-O e6**

**8.Rd1**

**8...Be7 9.c4**

Setting up the Hedehog structure, making sure d6 will always be a target from now on.

**9...Qc7 10.Nc3 a6 11.b3**

Setting up the Queen-side fianchetto while also protecting c4.

**11...O-O 12.Bb2**

The Bishop feels really good on the long diagonal, always having ideas to switch on the weak d6 pawn by playing Ba3.

**12...Ne5 13.Rac1 Bxf3 14.Bxf3 Qc5 15.Qe2**

Trading on c5 would have removed Black's weakness from d6, so we are trying to avoid that!

**15...Rac8 16.g3**

Intending to go Bg2 if we can.

**16...Nxf3+**

Of course, Black will capture that Bishop. Black wants to play against the light squares around our King.

**17.Qxf3 Qc6 18.Qe2**

Keeping an eye on the b5 square, if Black ever tries to break.

**18...Rfe8 19.Rd2**

Doubling up on the d file, to put pressure on the d6 pawn.

**19...h5 20.Rcd1**

White is slightly better because there are no weaknesses, and has much easier play since Black has no pawn breaks and has to deal with the weak d6 pawn for the rest of the game.

**3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4**

**4...Nc6**

**5.Qe3**

**5...Nf6 6.Be2 Bg4**

**7.O-O g6 8.Rd1**

The standard Rook move, threatening to play e5.

**8...Nd7 9.h3**

Making a luft and taking the Bishop Pair.

**9...Bxf3 10.Bxf3 Bg7 11.c3**

Limiting the power of the enemy Bishop!

**11...O-O 12.Na3**

White is expecting b5-b4 to come at some point, so that is why the Knight is heading to c2, in order to keep an eye on that plan.

**12...a6 13.Nc2 Qc7 14.g3 b5 15.Bg2 Rab8 16.Qe2**

making room for the c1 Bishop to enter the game

**16...b4 17.cxb4**

i think this is better than c4 because White will be able to attack on the Queen-side later

**17...Nxb4 18.Nxb4 Rxb4 19.Rb1**

Protecting the b2 pawn, so the c1 Bishop can finally move.

**19...Qc4 20.Qxc4 Rxc4 21.Bg5**

I like White in these scenarios because the Bishop Pair has huge potential in the long run, White can create a passer on the Queen-side with the pawn majority, making all the endgames really tough for Black that can only sit and wait playing a defensive game, whether Black can hold this or not, White will be the one enjoying it.

**16...Nbd7 17.Nxd7 Nxd7 18.Nd5**

Was much better for White with a huge development lead, and Black being unable to bring the rest of the pieces into the game. White can play for the weak b6 pawn, and push the Queen-side majority in the game.

**4...Nc6**

**5.Qe3**

**5...Nf6 6.Be2 g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.h3**

**8...Qb6 9.Qxb6**

The endgames with doubled pawns on the b-file are good for White since the pawns are weak. Generally we like to keep Queens on the board and play for a King-side attack with Qf4-Qh4, but here we go for the endgame because we can ruin the enemy pawn structure on the Queen-side.

**9...axb6 10.Nc3 Be6 11.a3 O-O 12.Rb1**

A nice move to protect the b2 pawn, preparing to develop with Be3 attacking the b6 pawn, then playing Rd1 and jumping with the Knight to d5.

**12...Rfc8 13.Be3 Nd7 14.Nd5**

The centralized Knight is too strong, probably Black will take the Knight and then we are going to place the pawn over there, stopping the e7 pawn.

**14...Bxd5 15.exd5 Nce5 16.Nxe5 Nxe5 17.c3**

Black is losing a pawn.

Limiting the g7 Bishop.

**14...f5 15.Bb5 Ra5 16.a4**

A strong move! White is defending the Bishop and the Rook on a5 is almost trapped.

**16...fxe4 17.Nxe4 d5 18.Ng5**

The Knight is heading to f3, from where it's going to be controlling the e5 square.

**18...h6 19.Nf3 Ra8 20.Re1**

Threatening to take on d5.

**20...Kf7 21.Ng4**

White is controlling the e5 square and can build up pressure by doubling the Rooks on the e-file.

**5...Nf6 6.Be2 g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.h3**

**8...O-O 9.Rd1 Qc7 10.Nc3 a6 11.Qf4**

Setting up a trap if Black goes Nb4. I already caught a lot of players in my blitz games with the following idea:

**11...Nb4**

Black goes for the logical move Nb4 because now it would have been awkward for us to defend the c2 pawn, but we have the counter strike:

**12.e5**

Picking up one of the Knights.

### (139) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 9.Rd1 Qc7

Forcing Black to take the annoying d5 Knight and give us a small space advantage.

**12...Nxd5 13.exd5 Ne5 14.c3**

**14...Rb8 15.Nxe5 Bxe5 16.Qh4**

Keeping an eye on the e7 pawn.

**16...Re8 17.a3**

Preparing to meet b4.

**17...a5 18.Bf4**

Is always a nice trade if Black allows it. The Black King becomes way more vulnerable without the fianchetto Bishop!

**18...Bg7 19.Rac1**

Again a little bit of prophylaxis against b4.

**19...Bd7 20.Bf1**

White has a more pleasant position here with a small space advantage and potential pressure on the backward e7 pawn. A good strategical idea is Be3-Bd4 to trade that strong Bishop and later start attacking the enemy King.

**11...Ne5 12.Nxe5**

Creating doubled pawns for Black on the e file and limiting the Fianchetto Bishop.

**12...dxe5 13.Qh4 b5 14.Be3**

Minding our own business, no need to worry about the c2 pawn.

**14...Bb7 15.f3**

A solid move, defending the e4 pawn and limiting the b7 Bishop!

**15...b4 16.Nb1**

We don't mind the c2 pawn, the Knight is heading to c4!

**16...Qxc2 17.Nd2 Qxb2 18.Bf1**

Black is risking his Queen for two pawns! We are threatening to play Rdc1 and Nc4.

**14...Bb7 15.f3**

**16...a5 17.Nd2**

Once the Knight lands on c4, White has an easy game.

**17...Ba6 18.Qe1 Bxe2 19.Qxe2 Qxc2 20.b3**

Controlling the c4 square!

**20...Qc6 21.Rac1 Qe6 22.Qc4**

Offering the endgame:

**22...Qxc4 23.Nxc4**

White has a lot of pressure on the Queen-side pawns and the doubled pawns on the e-file are an obstacle for their Bishop.

**14...b4 15.Nd5**

Forcing Black to take the d5 Knight.

**15...Nxd5 16.exd5 Qxc2 17.Bd3 Qxb2 18.Qxe7**

White's d pawn is very strong.

**14...b4 15.Nd5**

**15...Nxd5 16.exd5 a5 17.c4 bxc3 18.bxc3**

White is better because the c-pawn will be advanced to c5 and the Rook will have a nice outpost on the b6 square, causing Black a lot of headaches.

### (144) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 9.Rd1 Qc7

**8...O-O 9.Rd1 Qc7 10.Nc3 a6 11.Qf4**

**11...h6**

An interesting idea, trying to meet Qh4 with g5.

**12.Nd5**

But we can go for the same structure once again!

**12...Nxd5 13.exd5 Ne5 14.c3**

Always a nice move to make, when the enemy Bishop is unchallenged on the long diagonal.

**14...Bd7 15.Be3 Nxf3+ 16.Bxf3 Rac8 17.Bd4**

Is very pleasant for White because the simple but effective plan is to double on the e-file, press on e7, and look for a Rook lift at the right moment to rotate the play onto the King-side, not to mention that h4-h5 is always a viable plan on top of that.

**12.Nd5**

**12...Nxd5 13.exd5 Ne5 14.c3**

**14...Bd7 15.Be3 Bb5**

Trades off the bad Bishop, but weakens the pawn structure.

**16.Bxb5**

Ruining the enemy structure.

**16...axb5 17.Nxe5 Bxe5 18.Qxh6**

Important to not go greedy here because:

**18...b4**

Black gets a lot of compensation.

### (146) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 9.Rd1 Qc7

**14...Bd7 15.Be3 Bb5**

**16.Bxb5**

**16...axb5 17.Nxe5 Bxe5 18.Qb4**

White is much better here because Black has a permanent weakness on b5, plus White can also press on the backward e7 pawn, and then rotate the attack onto the King-side.

**10.Nc3**

Renewing the threat of e5!

**10...Qa5 11.Ng5**

Going after the Bishop!

**11...Bd7 12.Bd2 Qc7 13.Rac1**

Prophylaxis, defending the c2 pawn and getting ready to play Nd5 in the future.

**13...h6 14.Nf3 Be6 15.Bf1 Rac8 16.Be1**

White is going to play Nd5 and push with c4.

Maneuvering the Knight to d4, or preparing to bring the Bishop to c3.

**15...Nc5 16.Bd2 Qb5 17.Bc3 Bxc3 18.Nxc3**

White has a better pawn structure.

**10.Nc3**

**10...Nd7 11.Nd5**

Placing the Knight on a very annoying square for Black! Next up, we can go Rb1 and try to develop the c1 Bishop on b2.

**11...Rc8**

Is threatening to take on d5 and play Nb4.

**12.c3**

We can prevent that and switch to the other plan of going Qf4-Qh4.

**12...a6 13.Qf4 Nde5 14.Qh4 Nxf3+ 15.Bxf3 Bd7 16.Bg5**

Forcing Black to play the awkward looking move f6.

**16...Re8 17.Bg4**

Is strong, threatening to take on d7 and play Nb6.

**17...Bxg4 18.hxg4**

White is much better and has the idea to Rook lift via d3-h3.

Eliminating the annoying Knight.

**19...Rxc4 20.f3**

White has such an easy position with no weaknesses while if Black wants to get rid of the d5 Knight he has to play e6, creating more weaknesses.

Playing for b4 here since it comes with a tempo!

**12...a5**

Trying to slow down White's plan a little bit, while intending to play Nb4.

**13.a3**

Simply stopping Nb4 and preparing to fianchetto the Bishop with b3-Bb2.

**13...Bd7 14.b3 f5 15.exf5 Bxf5 16.Bb2**

We want to trade Bishops in order to create a weakness over the dark squares.

**16...Bxc2**

Would fail to:

**17.Bxg7 Kxg7 18.Qc3+**

Winning the Bishop.

**11...Nc5 12.Rb1**

Could be very weak in the long run.

**14.Bb5**

Keeping an eye on the weak pawn on a4 and preparing to develop the c1 Bishop with Qe2.

**14...Bd7 15.Qe2 Rc8 16.Be3**

White is developing using the fact that Nxe4 is running into Bb6!

**16...Nb8 17.Bd4**

Trading the Fianchetto Bishop always makes the enemy King vulnerable!

**17...Bxd4 18.Nxd4 Bc6 19.Nc3**

White is much better because the a4 pawn is very likely to fall.

Taking this way so we can attack the e7 pawn.

**15...Nce5 16.Nxe5 Nxe5 17.c5**

White is better with the extra space on the Queen-side and the Bishop Pair.

Covering the b4 square before transferring the Queen onto the King-side.

**11...Na5**

Black was annoyed of Nd5 ideas, so he tried to go for piece play on the Queen-side.

**12.Qg5**

The simple and effective Queen transfer!

**12...Bc4 13.Bd3**

A fine move, inviting Black to trade in our terms and winning White a tempo.

**13...Bxd3 14.Rxd3 Nc4 15.Qh4 Rac8 16.b3**

Important to kick the Knight.

**16...Ne5 17.Nxe5**

Creating doubled pawns for Black on the e file.

**17...dxe5 18.Be3 Rfd8 19.Nd5 Nxd5 20.Rxd5**

White has a better pawn structure.

**11...h6 12.Rb1**

The plan with Qf4-Qh4 was no longer effective here so White is preparing to play b3-Bb2-Nd5.

**12...Rfd8**

Threatening to play d5.

**13.Nd5**

The perfect timing, stopping Black's pawn break!

**13...Bxd5 14.exd5 Nb8 15.c4**

Taking space on the Queen-side, while preparing Nd4, so the d5 pawn is protected.

**15...Nbd7 16.Nd4 a5 17.b3**

The right place for the Bishop, White only had other things to do first, but now it's time to return to the initial plan of going b3-Bb2!

**17...Rdc8 18.Bb2**

White was much better having the weak b5 square for the Knight, extra space, the weak pawn on e7, and on top of that the Bishop Pair.

Was a poor move by Black, but it shows how difficult the position is:

**18.e5**

White goes for the most energetic continuation:

**18...Nfd7 19.e6**

Immediately seizing the initiative!

**19...fxe6 20.Ng5**

Wins for White because Black will lose e6.

**16...b4 17.Nd5 Bxd5 18.exd5 a5 19.Rac1**

White is better with the Bishop Pair and is going to play c4 next.

Preparing to develop the Queen-side with b4 and Bb2, eventually jumping with the Knight on d5.

**12...a6 13.b4**

grabbing some space and preparing to go Bb2 and then jump with the Knight

**13...Qc7 14.Bb2 b5 15.Nd5**

Forcing Black to make an awkward decision:

**15...Nxd5 16.exd5**

Taking this way, targeting the e7 pawn.

**16...Ne5 17.Nxe5 Bxe5 18.Bxe5 dxe5 19.Rbc1**

Threatening to play c4.

**19...Qb8 20.c4 bxc4 21.Bxc4**

White is much better since it feels like a pawn up on the Queen-side because Black has the doubled pawns. Notice that White is ready to jump with the Rook on c5 at some point, taking advantage of the outpost.

But White has this way to enter Black's position. White is better because Black has to deal with the weak Queen-side.

**11...a6 12.Qf4 Qc7 13.Qh4 Ne5**

Playable but slightly inferior:

**14.Nxe5 dxe5 15.Be3**

Developing the Bishop on the natural square, preparing Nd5, or simply f3-Qf2.

**15...Be6 16.Rac1**

Defending c2, getting ready to play c4, after we jump with the Knight on d5.

**16...Rfd8 17.Rxd8+**

We have a surprising way to make progress on the Queen-side:

**17...Qxd8 18.f3**

White is better with the 3 against 2 majority on the Queen-side.

**15...Be6 16.Rac1**

**16...Rfd8 17.Rxd8+**

**17...Rxd8 18.Na4**

Threatening to play Bb6 and to push c4, after which it's going to feel like a pawn up for White on the Queen-side.

**18...Qc6 19.Nc5 Bc8 20.c4**

White is simply better here with a 3 against 2 majority on the Queen-side, that will start to tell after White will push the pawns:

**20...b6 21.Nd3**

The pawn is untouchable:

**21...Nxe4 22.Qxe7 Re8 23.Qa7**

The Queen-side is falling apart.

### (167) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 9.Rd1 Bd7

**15...Be6 16.Rac1**

**16...b5 17.a4**

Attacking the Queen-side!

**17...b4**

Looks aggressive at first, but it's just weakening the Queen-side:

**18.Nd5 Bxd5 19.exd5**

White is better here because of the Bishop Pair, mainly due to Black's weakened Queen-side, and on top of that the potential of a passed pawn on the c-file.

### (168) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 9.Rd1 Bd7

**17...Bc4 18.axb5 Bxe2 19.Nxe2 axb5 20.f3**

The engines are not impressed here with White's position, but from a human point of view it's pretty clear that White is up a pawn on the Queen-side!

Trading the Fianchetto Bishop.

**14...Ne5 15.Nxe5 dxe5 16.Be3**

We are keeping the Bishops on the board here, because the g7 Bishop is blocked by the e5 pawn!

**16...Be6 17.f3**

The engines are not worried here, but the endgames would be very tough for Black because White has the Queen-side majority and will create a passed pawn on the c file.

### (170) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 9.Rd1 Bd7 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4**

**11...a6 12.Qf4 Qc7 13.Qh4 b5 14.Bh6**

**14...Rfe8 15.Nd5**

Going for this structure is always pleasant for White, because the pawn on e7 can be weak.

**15...Nxd5 16.exd5 Ne5 17.Bxg7 Kxg7 18.c3**

We are not interested in taking on e5 because Black gets counterplay with f5, so instead we keep it simple, Nd4 and f4 can be annoying for Black.

**18...Nxf3+ 19.Bxf3**

White is slightly better here because the e7 pawn is vulnerable, if Black tries to get rid of it by playing e6, it will make things even worse – the d6 pawn will become weak after dxe6 and Black's King will be more vulnerable to h4-h5 ideas. Notice that White has no weaknesses, and the White King is safer.

### (171) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 9.Rd1 Nd7

**8...O-O 9.Rd1 Nd7 10.Nc3 a6 11.a3**

Preparing to transfer the Queen to h4.

**11...b5 12.Qf4 Nde5 13.Nxe5 Nxe5 14.a4**

Asking Black some serious questions on the Queen-side. Note that you always want to take advantage of an overextended structure. Only because we played a3 earlier, it doesn't mean that we are not ready to be aggressive on the Queen-side if needed.

**14...b4 15.Nd5 a5 16.Qh4**

Notice how we are combining Queen-side play with King-side play! vNow Black is forced to defend e7 in an awkward way.

**16...Re8 17.c3**

Now you see why we forced b4, so we can attack it and open up the Queen-side in our favor:

**17...bxc3 18.bxc3 Ba6 19.Bb5**

The problem with Black's position is that White is coming up with constant threats and now Black has to decide whether he wants to give White a passed pawn on b5 or to retreat with his most active piece, the Knight from e5.

### (172) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 9.Rd1 Nd7 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**11...b5 12.Qf4 Nde5 13.Nxe5 Bxe5 14.Qh4**

Preparing to annoy Black with Bg5.

**14...Nd4 15.Bd3**

Forced, to protect the c2 pawn.

**15...e6 16.Bg5**

Forcing Black to weaken himself.

**16...f6 17.Be3**

Now that Black played the ugly move f6 we can go to the normal e3 square.

**17...f5**

Has to be played so the Bishop on e5 does not get trapped.

**18.Qxd8 Rxd8 19.exf5 gxf5 20.f4**

Fixing the structure.

**20...Bf6 21.Be4**

A small tactic to get a positional edge.

**21...Ne2+ 22.Nxe2 fxe4 23.c3**

White has a better endgame here because Black has the doubled pawns, a bad light-squared Bishop, and White can trade off the dark-squared Bishops at some point with Bd4 bringing the King to the center via f2-e3.

### (173) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 9.Rd1 Nd7 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4**

**14...Nd4 15.Bd3**

**15...e6 16.Bg5**

**16...f6 17.Be3**

**17...f5**

**18.Qxd8 Rxd8 19.exf5 Nxf5 20.Bb6**

White has a pleasant endgame here because Black has got the hanging pawns that White can play against, also note that Bxf5 is a constant threat with ideas of Bc7.

### (174) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 9.Rd1 Nd7 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4**

**5...Nf6 6.Be2 g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.h3**

**11.Qf4**

**11...Nde5 12.Nd5 Qd8 13.Nxe5 Nxe5 14.Qh4**

White is better here because Bishop to g5 is the next move, forcing Black to weaken himself by playing f6, after which White can simply retreat the Bishop to e3 and have a much easier game with the locked Black Bishop on g7.

### (175) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 9.Rd1 Nd7 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4**

**4...Nc6**

**5.Qe3**

**5...Nf6 6.Be2 g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.h3**

**8...O-O 9.Rd1 Nd7 10.Nc3 b6**

**11.b3**

This move has been played succesfuly by Anton Demchenko against one of the biggest experts of the Sicilian from the Black side, Alexei Sarana. The point is to develop the Bishop to b2, and after defending it with the move Rb1, White can jump on d5 with the Knight, putting annoying pressure on Black's position.

**11...Bb7 12.Bb2 Nc5 13.a3**

Small profilaxis, avoiding Nb4 ideas, and maybe even considering to play b4 ourselves.

**13...Qc8 14.Rab1**

Defending the Bishop and preparing to jump with the Knight to d5.

**14...Ne5 15.Nd5 Nxf3+ 16.Bxf3 Bxd5 17.Bxg7**

An important small detail to bring Black's King on g7 so you can either check on d4 or Rook lift Rd4-Rh4 with a tempo.

**17...Kxg7 18.exd5**

Capturing this way to fix the weakness on e7 and prepare the Rook lift via-d4.

**18...Re8 19.Rd4**

White is much better here since you can press on the e7 pawn and switch to the King-side with Rh4 whenever you feel like it's the good time. As an aditional idea you could consider advancing your pawn to h5 trying to weaken Black's Queen-side even more. Note that Black's only pawn break is e5 but that will always increase your Bishop's strength and create aditional weaknesses.

Keeping as many pieces on the board as possible because White has a small space advantage.

Creating a weakness on e6.

**18...fxe6 19.Bg4**

Targeting the weak pawn on e6.

**19...e5 20.fxe5 Bxe5 21.Na4**

Targeting now the b6 square, working together with the Bishop from g4!

**21...Bxb2 22.Rxb2**

White is about to win the b6 pawn.

Centralizing the Queen, preparing King-side play with f4, or Queen-side play with a4.

**18...Nd7 19.c4**

Creating a weak pawn on a6!

**19...bxc4 20.Bxc4 Bxd5 21.exd5**

This move is very important since it gives White a nice positional advantage by fixing the weakness on e7. White can rotate the Rooks by doubling on the e-file, while he can also include King-side play connected with h4-h5 and then a Rook lift via e3.

Inviting Black to take it!

**17...Nxb4**

Is already a concession:

**18.axb4 Qe7 19.c4**

White is better here because the pawn on d6 is weak, and potentially the a6 pawn could be weak. On top of that White could rotate to the King-side with ideas such as Qh6 and Ng5.

### (180) 5. The Harikrishna System - Hungarian variation 9.Rd1 Nd7 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

**3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4**

**4...Nc6**

**5.Qe3**

**5...Nf6 6.Be2 g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.h3**

**8...O-O 9.Rd1 Nd7 10.Nc3 b6**

**11.b3**

**11...Bb7 12.Bb2 Rc8 13.a3**

**13...a6 14.Rab1**

**14...b5 15.Nd5**

**15...Bxb2 16.Rxb2 e6 17.Nb4**

**17...Qc7 18.Nxc6 Bxc6**

Not defending a6, but has a tactical point:

**19.c4 bxc4 20.Bxc4 Bxe4**

Was Black's idea.

**21.Qxe4 d5 22.Qe3**

Getting ready to hunt the Black King.

**22...dxc4 23.bxc4 Nc5 24.Rbd2**

White is better because the d-file belongs to him, and Black's King is potentially vulnerable due to the lack of a Fianchetto Bishop.

### (181) 5. The Harikrishna System - Mainline 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6**

The most popular reply to 2.Nf3, Black is setting up a bunch of strong Sicilians such as the Najdorf Sicilian, the Dragon Sicilian and the Classical Sicilian. I decided to tackle these bulls with the Hungarian Variation that is arising after 3.d4 cxd4 and now the Queen recapture 4.Qxd4!?<addz start="3.d4"/>

**3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4**

Going for the Hungarian Variation! This used to be played from time to time by very strong Grand Masters, but mostly used as a surprise weapon. The traditional way of playing this line is to pin the Knight with Bb5, but only in the late part of 2018, the second-best Indian player Harikrishna Pentala started to implement the original idea with 5.Qe3 that is our main focus of the repertoire. It might seem odd at first, but White's play is fairly simple and straightforward looking to rush Be2, O-O, h3 and Rd1 threatening to play e5.<addz start="5.Qe3"/>

**4...Nc6**

**5.Qe3**

**5...Nf6 6.Be2 g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.h3**

**8...O-O 9.Rd1 Nd7 10.Nc3 b6**

**11.b3**

**11...Bb7 12.Bb2 Rc8 13.a3**

**13...a6 14.Rab1**

**14...b5 15.Nd5**

**15...Bxb2 16.Rxb2 e6 17.Nb4**

**17...Qc7 18.Nxc6 Qxc6 19.c4**

The main idea to put Black's Queen-side under pressure!

**19...bxc4 20.Bxc4**

Notice how White already has a long term target on a6.

**20...Qxe4 21.Qxe4 Bxe4 22.Rxd6**

I like White in this scenarios because of the more active Rook and the pawn majority on the Queen-side can later on create a decisive passer.

### (182) 6. Accelerated Dragon - Accelerated Dragon 5...Qa5+ 6. 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

Going for the Accelerated Dragon! From my experience, the Black players are one-trick-pony of this opening and they know it very well. Thinking about the fact that you are going to face this opening less often than 2...Nc6 and 2...d6 it makes sense to recommend a line that is easy to play for White and you don't rely on move by move stuff that much. This is the most common move order for the Accelerated Dragon. Black can start by going 2...Nc6 and only after 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 to go for the King-side fianchetto with 4...g6 . This move order has the plus that it avoid the line that I am going to suggest for White but the drawback that it allows theRossolimo ( r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3.Bb5 ). So it doesn't really matter what move order Black plays, you will be prepared against both.

**3.d4 Bg7**

This move is an interesting sideline, but is mostly played as a surprise weapon.White has more than one way to gain a pleasant position, that is why a lot of players don't bother with it that much, but i found a really nice idea that questions Black's whole set-up!

**4.dxc5**

If Black wants to recapture the pawn, White will gain a lot of tempis attacking the Queen. In my opinion this move is the best obejctively speaking and if Black is not careful, White can gain a huge attack right away.

**4...Na6**

Sometimes is a good idea, but it simply doesn't work here.

**5.Bxa6 Qa5+ 6.Nc3 bxa6 7.O-O**

Looks to be the simplest.

**7...Qxc5 8.Be3 Qa5 9.Bd4**

The extra tempis will start to tell pretty soon.

### (183) 6. Accelerated Dragon - Accelerated Dragon 5...Qa5+ 6. 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

**3.d4 Bg7**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Na6**

**5.Bxa6 bxa6 6.Qd5**

White is a pawn up and develops with tempo!

**6...Rb8 7.Ne5**

Forcing Black to create some extra weaknesses.

**7...e6 8.Qd6 Bb7 9.Nc3**

White is a pawn up and has dominant position.

### (184) 6. Accelerated Dragon - Transposing into the Benoni 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

**3.d4 Bg7**

This move is an interesting sideline, but is mostly played as a surprise weapon. White has more than one way to gain a pleasant position, that is why a lot of players don't bother with it that much, but i found a really nice idea that questions Black's whole set-up!

**4.d5**

The Benoni is perfectly playable of course, but I see no reason why should we enter this as 1. e4 players.

### (185) 6. Accelerated Dragon - Accelerated Dragon 5...Qa5+ 6. 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

**3.d4 Bg7**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Nf6**

Black can try to develop this way, but we can take advantage of this and gain a few tempis by attacking the Knight.

**5.Nc3 Qa5 6.e5**

Is always important to question your opponent dubious play otherwise it might just transform into good play if you don't take appropriate measures at the right time!

**6...Ne4 7.Qd4 Nxc3 8.Bd2**

Notice how White develops while Black is moving the same piece more than once.

**8...b6 9.Bxc3 Qxc5 10.Qxc5 bxc5 11.O-O-O**

White has a very pleasant position with extra space, passive Black Bishop on g7, and the weak pawn on c5.

### (186) 6. Accelerated Dragon - Accelerated Dragon 5...Qa5+ 6. 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

**3.d4 Bg7**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Qa5+**

**5.c3 Qxc5 6.Na3**

They tell you never put your Knight on the rim, (a good general rule) but here we see how modern chess works.We don't think about it this way here, we are thinking one step ahead and we see that the Knight is going to b5, from where is creating a lot of pressure on the Queen-side and it can harm Black's development!

**6...d6**

This is the right idea to develop, but Black will always be a tempo short! If Black could get Nf6 and O-O, his position will be playable but we are not going to allow that!

**7.Be3**

Always try to develop with tempo.

**7...Qc7 8.e5**

Again huge credits to this move, not allowing Black to finish development!

**8...dxe5 9.Nb5 Qd8 10.Qxd8+ Kxd8 11.Bxa7**

White is much better with a huge development advantage and the Queen-side pawn-majority can start rolling at some point.

### (187) 6. Accelerated Dragon - Accelerated Dragon 5...Qa5+ 6. 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

**3.d4 Bg7**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Qa5+**

**5.c3 Qxc5 6.Na3**

**6...d6**

**7.Be3**

**7...Qa5 8.e5**

The star idea in this position, not allowing Black to develop easily!

**8...Nc6 9.Nc4 Qd8 10.exd6**

White is just up a pawn with good position.

### (188) 6. Accelerated Dragon - Accelerated Dragon 5...Qa5+ 6. 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

**3.d4 Bg7**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Qa5+**

**5.c3 Qxc5 6.Na3**

**6...d6**

**7.Be3**

**7...Qa5 8.e5**

**8...Bxe5 9.Nxe5**

Whenever White manages to trade the fianchetto Bishop for a Knight and keep the dark squared Bishop on the board this will be worth at least a pawn!

**9...Qxe5 10.Nb5 Na6 11.Be2**

White simply has long term compensation because of the weak dark squares on the King-side and Black will never have a safe King.

### (189) 6. Accelerated Dragon - Accelerated Dragon 5...Qa5+ 6. 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

**3.d4 Bg7**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Qa5+**

**5.c3 Qxc5 6.Na3**

**6...Bxc3+**

Looks scary at first, but it is very risky to grab material like that and ignore your development!

**7.bxc3 Qxc3+ 8.Qd2**

We are baiting Black to take the Rook and place the Queen in the corner!

**8...Qxa1 9.Nb5**

The first signal that Black has got some issues of his own!

**9...Na6 10.Nc3**

Making sure that the Queen stays in the corner for a little while.

**10...Nc5 11.Bc4**

White wants to castle as fast as possible, with the idea to trap the Black Queen with Bb2.

**11...b5**

Blacks only chance is to try to interrupt White but it is still not enough.

**12.O-O**

This move is very instructive because is highlighting the goods of development in the early stage of the game.

**12...bxc4 13.Ba3 Nxe4**

Black's only move to keep the Queen alive.

**14.Nxe4 Qg7 15.Nd6+**

Now we can see that even though Black is up an exchange and 3 pawns, White is the one pressing because of the active pieces, while Black has only developed his Queen in 15 moves!

**15...exd6 16.Qxd6**

Black is simply getting mated with Re1 to follow and then Bb4-Ba5. I want you to notice that Black is up a Rook and 2 pawns but in reality White is up a piece because the h8-Rook and the g8-Knight are not participating into the game.

### (190) 6. Accelerated Dragon - Accelerated Dragon 5...Qa5+ 6. 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

**3.d4 Bg7**

**12...bxc4 13.Ba3 Nxe4**

**14.Nxe4 Qg7 15.Nd6+**

**15...Kf8 16.Qd5 Rb8 17.Qa5**

The funny thing is that Black has back-rank issues with almost all the pieces on the board!

**17...Ba6 18.Ne5**

White will either mate Black or collect the b8-Rook and the a6-Bishop leading to an easily winning position.

### (191) 6. Accelerated Dragon - Accelerated Dragon 5...Qa5+ 6. 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

**3.d4 Bg7**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Qa5+**

**5.c3 Qxc5 6.Na3**

**6...b6**

Good idea but bad timing!

**7.Be3 Qc6 8.Bc4 Bb7 9.O-O**

The e4 pawn is intact because of Bxf7 ideas, and White has a huge development advantage.

### (192) 6. Accelerated Dragon - Accelerated Dragon 5...Qa5+ 6. 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

**3.d4 Bg7**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Qa5+**

**5.c3 Qxc5 6.Na3**

**6...b6**

**7.Be3 Qc7 8.Nb5 Qd8 9.Qd5**

White is simply too fast here.

**9...Nc6 10.Bc4**

White is close to winning here because Black can't find a good way to develop the rest of his pieces. Looks like e6 is forced on the next move after which White will take full advantage of the weakened dark squares.

### (193) 6. Accelerated Dragon - Accelerated Dragon 5...Qa5+ 6. 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

**3.d4 Bg7**

**4...Qa5+**

**5.c3 Qxc5 6.Na3**

**6...b6**

**7.Be3 Qc7 8.Nb5 Qc6 9.Qb3 a6 10.Bc4**

Creating a threat of Bd5 while also attacking on f7 and finishing development in the same time.

**10...e6 11.Nfd4**

Forcing Black to give up the fianchetto Bishop to avoid huge material losses.

**11...Bxd4 12.Nxd4 Qxe4 13.Be2**

Black is up a pawn at the moment, but White has a huge initiative being fully developed and the Queen-side is ready to fall at any moment.

### (194) 6. Accelerated Dragon - Accelerated Dragon 5...Qa5+ 6. 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

**3.d4 Bg7**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Qa5+**

**5.c3 Qxc5 6.Na3**

**6...a6**

Stopping White's main idea to go to b5 but it weakens the b6 square.

**7.Nc4 Qc7 8.Be3**

White is winning here because the Knight will arrive on b6 next move, winning material.

### (195) 6. Accelerated Dragon - Accelerated Dragon 5...Qa5+ 6. 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

**3.d4 Bg7**

White is up an exchange.

### (196) 6. Accelerated Dragon - Accelerated Dragon 5...Qa5+ 6. 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

**3.d4 Bg7**

**4.dxc5**

**5.c3 Qxc5 6.Na3**

**6...Nf6 7.Nb5 b6**

**8.b4**

**8...Qc6 9.e5 Nd5 10.Qxd5**

Notice how such a ''normal'' looking move, is failing drastically to a basic tactic.

**10...Qxd5 11.Nc7+ Kd8 12.Nxd5**

White is simply up a Knight.

### (197) 6. Accelerated Dragon - Accelerated Dragon 5...Qa5+ 6. 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

**3.d4 Bg7**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Qa5+**

**5.c3 Qxc5 6.Na3**

**6...Nf6 7.Nb5 b6**

**8.b4**

**8...Qc6 9.e5 Ne4 10.Nfd4**

Notice how White is taking advantage of the early Queen development by Black!White is gaining a lot of tempis, and grabs the initiative while developing his pieces attacking Black's Queen.

**10...Qb7 11.Bd3**

Another move with tempo since White is threatening Qe2.Notice how the ''well placed central Knight'' is actually a weakness in Black's position!

**11...Bxe5 12.Qe2**

It is clear that opening up the position could only benefit White since it is the better developed side.

**12...d5 13.f3**

Forcing Black to give up his key Bishop because otherwise he will loose a lot of material.

**13...Bxd4 14.cxd4**

Important to keep alive the Nd6 threat if Black decides to retreat with the Knight, then White can take advantage of the pin and fork Black's King and Queen on d6!

**14...a6 15.fxe4 axb5 16.O-O**

White is simply winning here because Black will never have a good place to hide his King! Whenever you are trying to evaluate a position, King's safety should be your number one priority! It doesn't really matter if you are up a pawn if you do not have a good place to hide your King. Notice how the lack of the fianchetto Bishop tells in this position when White has the dark squared Bishop on the board. Black will practically never be able to castle short since a Bishop might just slide on to the h6 square and the Queen could possibly try to come and mate you on the g7 square.

Looking to capture the e4 pawn while keeping an eye on the b5 pawn as well.

**16...Qc7 17.Bxe4 Ra4 18.Bd2**

White is very active, and I see a lot of potential with the Queen-side majority in the long run.

White is up a pawn.

### (201) 6. Accelerated Dragon - Accelerated Dragon 6.Qa4 Bg7 # 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

**3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4**

This line was known to be harmless for Black after 4...Nf6 5.e5 , Black has enough counterplay after the move 5...Nc6 , White can try to continue with 6.Qa4 Nd5 7.Qe4 but Black has been doing more than okay after the move 7...Nb6 . This used to be the old main line, but nowadays White found out that the move 5.Nc3 , staying flexible is leading to a positional game when White usually grabs the Bishop Pair, or if Black wants to avoid the positional squeeze he is supposed to sacrifice a pawn with 8...Bg7!? but this does not guarantee him an equal game.<skip start="8...Bg7"/>

**4...Nf6 5.Nc3**

The modern approach, picked up by a lot of strong Grand Masters.Now White is threatening to play e5 and then if Nc6 happens, White can safely go for Qa4, and there will be no Nd5 available for Black now since we already developed our Knight to c3!

**5...Nc6 6.Qa4**

This is the key move! White is threatening to play e5 next, so to stop that, Black has to play 6...d6 (the other moves are just inferior) and we can take advantage of the pinned Knight by going 7.e5! .

**6...Bg7 7.e5 Ng8 8.Bf4**

White simply protects the e5 pawn and continues developing.

**8...Nh6 9.h3**

A small move that makes sure to stop the Black Knight from jumping on g4.

**9...O-O 10.O-O-O a6 11.g4**

Just making sure that there will be no Nf5.

**11...Rb8 12.Qe4**

White dominates the whole board.

The King is always safe on this side, Black's counterplay with a6-b5 is very slow.

**10...O-O 11.Bc4+ Kh8 12.Rhe1**

Notice how nice the Rooks are placed on the semi-open central files!

**12...Qa5 13.Qxa5 Nxa5 14.Bb3 Nxb3+ 15.axb3 b6 16.Bg3 Ng8 17.Nd5**

Trying to stop White from playing e5, but is running into Nd5 ideas.

**7.Bg5 Bg7 8.O-O-O O-O 9.Nd5**

Black can't take this Knight because the e7 pawn will hang.

**9...Qd8 10.Bxf6 exf6 11.h4**

With a better pawn structure for White and attacking chances on the King-side based on h5.

**7.e5**

It's played sometimes, as a surprise weapon.

**8.exd6 Qxd6 9.Nb5 Qb8**

Is leading to some crazy complications:

**10.Bf4 e5 11.Bg3 Bg7 12.Qa3**

White tries to stop Black from castling.

**12...Bf8 13.Qb3 Be6 14.Bc4**

White's play is based on a discovery check.

**14...Na5 15.Qa4 Nxc4 16.h3**

Now the calm h3 move, and Black has a lot of stuff hanging.

**16...Nb6 17.Nc7+ Ke7 18.Qb4+ Kd7 19.Qd2+ Kxc7 20.Nxe5**

The enemy King is in trouble.

**20...Bd6 21.Qc3+ Kd8 22.Nxf7+ Bxf7 23.O-O-O**

White is down three pieces, but is going to win back a lot of material with a winning position.

**16...Bc5**

Is Black's best play, but i doubt that someone can find this in a practical game.

**17.Nc7+ Ke7 18.Nxe6 b5**

A strong intermezo to keep the Knight alive on c4.

**19.Qb3 Bxf2+ 20.Bxf2 Nxf2 21.Rf1 Kxe6 22.Rxf2 f6 23.O-O-O**

The computer thinks this is about equal, but in a practical game i will definetly pick White here because the White King is very safe, while as Black you need only one step into the wrong direction and you are pretty much doomed.

**10.Qxb4 Nxb4 11.Bc4**

But White has this stunning move, keeping the fork alive on c7 while making sure that he can develop his kingside after Black takes on c2!

**11...Nxc2+ 12.Ke2 Nxa1 13.Nc7+ Kd8 14.Nxa8 Bd7 15.Bf4 Nc2 16.Rc1 Nb4 17.Ng5**

White will regain the pawn, while having a huge initiative against Black's King.

**12...Be6 13.Bc4 O-O 14.O-O Bxc3 15.bxc3 Bxc4 16.Qxc4 Rfe8 17.Rad1**

White was much better in a correspondence game with a pawn up and the weak dark squares around the Black King.

**8.exd6 Qb6**

Looks pretty dangerous at first, threatening to take on f2.

**9.Nd1**

I recommend this move since is easier to play, and i can't really explain 9.Nd5.Personally i would just go 9.Nd1 for practical reasons.Just keep in mind that chess is a game between humans, so sometimes even though the computer will tell you some line is +2, you should not follow it blindly, and try to imagine that you are sitting at the board, with the clock ticking and an opponent in front of you, that is probably prepared in this line.Yes, analysing +2 positions with an engine next to you is fun, but remember there is no engine during the game.

**9...exd6 10.Ne3 Nf6 11.b3 d5 12.Bb5**

Stopping Black from playing d4, since you will be able to just take it.

**12...Bg7 13.Bb2 O-O 14.O-O**

White's position is more pleasant here with easy moves such as the Queen could come to h4, Rad1. Black's isolated pawn is a permanent weakness that White can play for. As a rule of thumb, when you are playing against the isolated pawn, you want to trade off the light pieces (Bishops and Knights), and keep the heavy pieces (Queen, Rooks). With only the heavy pieces on the board it is very unpleasant and tough to defend because the pressing side can just double or triple on to the pawn, and then can look for a pawn break such as c4 in our case. Black will lose the d5 pawn since the isolated pawn will be pinned.

White just gets easy development, and free play against the isolated pawn, so White is much better already.

**7.e5**

**7...dxe5**

The main move by far, I never really faced the alternatives, but I did analyse them in case you might face any.

**8.Nxe5**

**8...Qd4**

Is the ''easy way out''.Usually this move is played trying to bail out of any preparation, forcing the endgame, and trying to hold a slightly worse position. I think the best way for White to punish this is by taking on c6, and after the Queen trade, to play 11.b3! developing the Bishop on the long diagonal, and shutting down the enemy Fianchetto Bishop.After that White's position is statically better because of the healthier pawn structure from the Queen-side.<skip/>

**9.Nxc6 Qxa4 10.Nxa4 bxc6 11.b3**

I like to challenge the diagonal and go for Bb2 next.

**11...Bf5 12.Ba6**

Developing with tempo, asking Black some concrete questions.

**12...Rd8 13.Bb7 Rd6**

The Rook has a weird position.

**14.O-O e5 15.Bb2 Nd7 16.Rfd1**

White just has a development advantage.

**16...f6 17.Rxd6 Bxd6 18.Bxc6 Bxc2 19.Nc3**

White has a small edge with the Queen-side majority.

White is flexible, not rushing to castle, keeping both options possible.

**13...Ng4 14.Bxg7 Kxg7 15.h3 Ne5 16.Be2**

Keeping the Bishop!

**16...Bf5 17.O-O-O**

White is a slightly better with a nicer pawn structure.

**8.Nxe5**

**8...Bg7**

This is a pawn sacrifice, but Black has to be very precise in order to keep realistic compensation for the pawn!The toughest test for Black is the move 9. Bb5, taking the pawn with the Bishop.Then Black's best defence is to force the light squared Bishops off with the move 11... Bd7! This is what the biggest expert of the line, Gadir Guseinov played as Black and managed to hold.It is important for Black to trade the light squared Bishops because he can later use the light squares from the Queen-side to generate counterplay, especially the c4 square.Notice that if Black does not go for 11... Bd7 and plays 11... Rb8 instead, we are avoiding the Bishop trade! Nevertheless i think White still keeps a small edge even in that case with precise play!

**9.Bb5**

**9...O-O 10.Nxc6 bxc6 11.Bxc6 Rb8**

Feels natural, but it's actually in Black's favor to trade the light squared Bishops!

**12.O-O Bf5 13.Bb5 Qc7 14.Bf4**

Forcing e5, locking the Bishop on g7!

**14...e5 15.Be3 Bxc2 16.Qxa7**

This is just a worse Benko for Black with the closed Bishop on g7.

**16...Rb7 17.Qa6 e4 18.Bf4 Qxf4**

It's Black's best bet to try to sacrifice the exchange but White should be able to defend with a few accurate moves:

**19.Qxb7 Ng4 20.g3 Qh6 21.h4 e3 22.f4**

Making sure that the Queen gets locked on h6!

**22...Bd4 23.Be2**

Simply stopping the pawn.

**23...Nf2 24.a4**

Now White can focus on his own play.

White is just up a pawn in the endgame. It is true that Black has some compensation, but it should not be enough for equality.

No more Bishop trade!

**15...Rc8 16.Bf1**

Notice how the Bishop on f1 is protecting the g2 square, while also covering the important c4 square!

**16...e6 17.Qh4**

Always a nice move to make, when the Queen has finished her job on a4, she can switch to the King-side.

**17...h5 18.Bf4 Qc6 19.Be5**

Centralizing the Bishop.

**19...Rxb2 20.Nd1**

Black is losing material.

**9.Bb5**

**9...O-O 10.Nxc6 bxc6 11.Bxc6 Bd7**

Has been played by the biggest expert in this line, Guseinov Gadir because it's in Black's favor to force the trade of the light-squared Bishops.

**12.O-O Rc8 13.Bxd7 Qxd7 14.Qa6**

**14...Rc6**

Seems to be Black's best play, based on correspondence games.

**15.Qe2 Rfc8 16.Rd1 Qb7 17.a4 e6 18.Qf3 Nd7 19.Ra3**

Black doesn't really have a constructive plan and is only waiting to see what White does, in order to respond. As White is also not easy to make progress, but you are up a pawn and Black always has to worry about material, so I think White is slightly better here.

It always makes sense to advance this pawn and have Ra3!? ideas.

**17...R6c7 18.a5 Qxf3 19.gxf3**

It is not going to be an easy conversion by any means, but White is up a pawn and is clearly the only side that can win this, while Black has to play a long and passive defence.

Creating an unpleasant pin.

**12...Qc8**

Looks rather passive but is avoiding any Nd5 jumps with tempo.

**13.Be3 a6 14.Bxc6**

White now trades the Bishop Pair for a structural advantage!

**14...bxc6 15.Bd4**

Important to annihilate the g7 Bishop!

**15...e5**

Is a little bit too much:

**16.Be3 f5 17.Rd6**

If Black over-extends you can take advantage of the weak pawn from c6!

**17...f4 18.Rxc6 Qb7 19.Bd2 Rad8 20.Qe4**

The best square for the Queen since Black has no good way to attack it.

**20...Qxb2**

Is a poisoned pawn:

**21.Rb1 Qa3 22.Qc4+ Kh8 23.Ne4**

White has a dominant Knight and the Black Queen is exposed.

This is a small inaquaracy because it allows White to fianchetto the Bishop with 12.g3.Notice that in the main line with 11...Qc8 this would have not been possible thanks to Ng4 ideas by Black, but with the Queen being on c7 this is no longer possible, and it gives White a pleasant position right away.

**12.g3**

The best place for the Bishop is on g2 in this position enjoying his time on the long diagonal!

**12...O-O 13.Bg2 a6 14.O-O b5 15.Qh4**

This is a very typical Queen transfer in this type of positions.

**15...Rfd8 16.a4**

Attacking the over-extended Queen-side.

**16...bxa4 17.Qxa4**

### (231) 6. Accelerated Dragon - Mainline 7.e5 dxe5 #14 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6**

Going for the Accelerated Dragon! From my experience, the Black players are one trick-pony of this opening and they know it very well. Thinking about the fact that you are going to face this opening less often than 2...Nc6 and 2...d6 it makes sense to recommend a line that is easy to play for White and you don't rely on move by move stuff that much. This is the most common move order for the Accelerated Dragon. Black can start by going 2...Nc6 and only after 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 to go for the King-side fianchetto with 4...g6 .This move order has the plus that it avoid the line that i am going to suggest for White but the drawback that it allows the Rossolimo ( 3.Bb5 ). So it doesn't really matter what move order Black plays, you will be prepared against both.

**9.Nxd7**

**9...Qxd7 10.Be3**

**10...Bg7 11.Rd1 Qg4**

Black tries to go for an endgame.Important to remember that we are not afraid of playing endgames with the Bishop Pair, but we want to make the trade in our terms, so that is why we are playing Qb3, and we are inviting Black to spend another move by going Qb4, and then if he takes, we are taking with the c pawn so we can use that file later!

**12.Qb3 Qb4 13.Be2 O-O! 14.Bf3 Qxb3 15.cxb3**

White can use the c file later, and also the c2 pawn could be weak in some lines.

**15...Rfd8 16.Ke2 Kf8 17.Na4 Rdc8 18.g4**

White has a better endgame due to the Bishop Pair and the space advantage that allows him to play on both sides of the board.White went on to win in the game.

White can use the c file later, and also the c2 pawn could be vulnerable in some lines.

**15...Rfd8 16.Bf3 a6 17.Ke2**

Notice that White doesn't go for castling anymore, because the King is very useful in the center since we are approaching the endgame phase, or a Queen-less middlegame as some people like to call it.

**17...e5 18.Bxc6**

Creating not only a weakness on c6, but one on a6 too, that White will try to exploit later.

**18...bxc6 19.Bb6**

Trying to contest the d file.

**19...Rd7 20.Rxd7 Nxd7 21.Be3 f5 22.Rd1**

White is faster on the d file!

**22...Nf6 23.Bg5**

White was better with a more active Rook, and the weak isolated Queen-side pawns in the game.

**14...Na5 15.Qb6 Nc4 16.Bxc4 Qxc4 17.Bc5 Rfe8 18.Rfe1 e5 19.h3**

White is a slightly better with more active pieces.

**14...b5 15.a4**

Attacking the over extended Queen-side.

**15...b4 16.Nd5 Nxd5 17.Rxd5**

White is much better here with active Rooks and Black has a very weak Queen-side. Already ideas such as Rc5 are very dangerous, while the Bishop Pair is always exerting a lot of pressure on both sides of the board.

**14...b5 15.a4**

**15...Na5 16.Qb4 Nc6 17.Qh4**

Now that we baited Black in playing b5, we can switch the Queen to the King-side!

**17...b4 18.Ne4 Nxe4 19.Qxe4 Bxb2 20.Bf3**

Black is unable to defend the Knight.

**15...Na5 16.Qb4 Nc6 17.Qh4**

**17...b4 18.Ne4 a5 19.b3 Qf5 20.Ng3 Qe5 21.Bb5**

White has a small edge thanks to the Bishop Pair and potentially weak Queen-side pawns.

**10...Bg7 11.O-O O-O 12.Rd1**

**12...Bxc3**

I am never a big fan on giving up the fianchetto Bishop in this types of positions.White's dark squared Bishop is simply way too dangerous for the Black King.

**13.bxc3 Qc7 14.Bf4 e5 15.Bh6 Rfe8 16.Qh4**

Was more pleasant for White with a safer King in the game.

**17...b4 18.Ne4 Ne5 19.Nxf6+ Bxf6 20.Qxb4 Rb8 21.Qe4**

Centralizing the Queen.

**21...Rxb2 22.Bh6 Re8 23.Rd5**

Activating the Rook while threatening to double on the d file.

**23...Nd7 24.Rfd1**

The Bishop pair in an open position + the active Rooks should guarantee White a small but steady edge.
