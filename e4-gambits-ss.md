## Italian 3...d6 #1

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3**

Whilst we were tempted to gambit straight away, straightforward, classical development for White won the day, at least initially.

**2...Nc6 3.Bc4**

The most aggressive post for the key light-squared bishop and one which doesn't have to lead to a Giuoco Piano manoeuvring struggle.

**3...d6**

is a slightly passive move sometimes seen at club level when Black wants to avoid theory. Here White often goes 4.d4 straight away, but we quite like to castle when Black must be a little careful:

**4.O-O**

The safest approach.

**4...Nf6**

is natural, but runs headlong into

**5.Ng5**

with an excellent version of the line 3...Nf6 4.Ng5 for White:

**5...d5 6.exd5 Nxd5**

Here it's more than possible to go in for that classic Fried Liver idea,

**7.Nxf7 Kxf7 8.Qf3+ Ke6 9.Nc3 Ne7 10.d4**

White enjoys far too strong an initiative after

**10...c6 11.dxe5 Kd7 12.Bg5**

when the game might end after

**12...Kc7 13.Bxd5 cxd5 14.Nb5+ Kb8 15.e6**

decisively opening up the h2-b8 diagonal.

## Italian 3...d6 #2

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 d6 4.O-O**

**4...Be7 5.d4 exd4 6.Nxd4**

6.c3 Nf6 doesn't really cut the mustard

**6...Nf6 7.Nc3**

This has long been known to be a fairly pleasant edge with White's greater space: for example,

**7...O-O 8.Re1 Nxd4 9.Qxd4 a6 10.a4**

Keeping Black's counterplay under control

**10...Re8 11.Bg5 h6 12.Bh4 Ng4 13.Bxe7 Rxe7 14.f4**

which left White advancing and beginning to squeeze away in Navara-Laznicka, Prague blitz 2018.

## Italian 3...Be7 #1

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4**

**3...Be7**

The Hungarian Defence. Of course, by a huge margin Black's two main options are

3...Bc5 4.O-O Nf6 5.d4 and

3...Nf6 4.d4.

**4.d4**

White can castle, but just like in the 3...Nf6 line, we quite like to blast open the centre without delay.

**4...exd4 5.c3**

There is absolutely nothing wrong with

5.Nxd4 Nf6 6.Nc3, with good chances for an edge, but why not switch to Scotch Gambit waters with Black committed to ...Be7?

**5...Na5**

This relatively rare choice does place the knight on the rim, but is also quite a critical test of our gambit.

**6.Be2**

White maintains the important bishop, leaving the knight on the rim.

**6...dxc3 7.Nxc3 d6**

Invariably played in the limited testing of this position and clearly a much better try than

7...Nf6 8.e5

**8.O-O Nc6**

Bringing the knight back into play.

8...Nf6 9.Qa4+ Nc6 10.e5

**9.Qa4**

An important pin and one which retains enough compensation for White.

**9...Bd7**

breaks the pin, but after

**10.Qb3**

White threatens Bc4

**10...Nf6 11.Qxb7 Rb8 12.Qa6 O-O 13.Qd3**

This should be slightly better for White, with Rd1 followed by b3 and Bb2 a decent way to complete development while neutralizing any pressure down the b-file.

## Italian 3...Be7 #2

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Be7 4.d4 exd4 5.c3 Na5 6.Be2 dxc3 7.Nxc3 d6 8.O-O Nc6 9.Qa4**

**9...Nf6 10.e5**

This direct advance is the main point behind White's play.

**10...Nd7 11.exd6 Bxd6 12.Bg5**

Completing development with tempo and likely a stronger try than the far from terrible

12.Nd5 of Turov-Tishin, Moscow 2005.

**12...Nc5**

A counterattack.

**13.Qh4 Qd7**

Blocking in his own bishop, but Black wants to go ...Qg4 and not

13...f6 14.Be3 O-O 15.Bxc5 Bxc5 16.Qc4+

**14.b4 Ne6 15.Rad1**

This position could really do with a test, but we'd both be delighted to try the white side. Black's king will prove rather vulnerable if he castles short, but in any case White has seized the initiative with Ne4 on the way or

**15...Nxg5 16.Nxg5 h6 17.Nge4**

followed by exchanging on d6 and Qg3.

## Italian 3...Bc5 #1

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3**

Against Black's classical response we recommend classical development in kind - at least for the first few moves!

**2...Nc6 3.Bc4**

The Italian Game or Giuoco Piano. White already has an eye on that classic weak spot in the black camp that is f7.

**3...Bc5 4.O-O**

Completing our kingside development, while tucking the king away. Do observe that in contrast Black's king is still on e8, and that actually can work to our advantage.

**4...Nf6 5.d4!?**

These days the quiet Giuoco Piano with 5.d3 followed by c3 is pretty topical, especially at the highest level, but the gambit introduced by the bold text move should really jolt your opponent awake. There won't be any slow manoeuvring here.

**5...Bxd4**

Black's most popular move, playing for exchanges and aiming to keep his pawn on e5.

**6.Nxd4**

We might have sacrificed a pawn, but are happy to trade pieces, thereby pocketing the bishop-pair while freeing the f-pawn.

**6...Nxd4 7.Bg5!?**

This pin is what attracted us to this line. White keeps the f-pawn in reserve, whereas a well-drilled or experienced opponent is much more likely to be ready for 7.f4, quite possibly with 7...d6 8.fxe5 dxe5 9.Bg5 Qe7, which is a fairly tough nut to crack. There's no doubt that this gambit is a good choice for fast (rapid and blitz) games, but it is also a very good choice at classical time controls too - be that at club or even the top level! Indeed, that most creative of modern-day players, Daniil Dubov, did much to reignite interest in 7. Bg5 when he deployed it in Dubov-Radjabov, Hamburg Grand Prix 2019:

**7...d6**

Black's most popular line along with 7...h6 8.Bh4, which we have analyzed in detail in the main course.

**8.f4 Bg4!**

Developing with tempo; we'll examine Black's alternatives in our main coverage of 1. e4 e5.

**9.Bxf6!**

White must exchange and go in for a queen swap as 9.Qd2 is well met by the cold-blooded 9...Nxe4!.

**9...Bxd1 10.Bxd8 Rxd8 11.c3!**

Radjabov continued to find all the right moves, but we can imagine that many an opponent would be enticed by

**11...Nc2? 12.Rxd1 Nxa1 13.Na3**

However, this slams the lid on any escape by the black knight and appears to favour White: for example,

**13...exf4 14.Rxa1 O-O 15.Kf2! Rfe8 16.Kf3**

White makes good active use of the king and hopes to exploit Black's weakened kingside:

**16...g5 17.Nb5 Re5! 18.h4**

This rejects the poisoned c-pawn and intending Rh1, as well as Nd4-f5.

## Italian 3...Bc5 #2

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.O-O Nf6 5.d4 Bxd4 6.Nxd4 Nxd4 7.Bg5 d6 8.f4**

**8...Be6**

Black's main move, seeking exchanges.

8...Bg4 9.Bxf6 Bxd1 10.Bxd8 Rxd8 11.c3 should be OK for Black, or at least after a series of precise moves he can reach an equal if not dead endgame. This line is analyzed in detail in one of the model games of the main course.

**9.fxe5**

Opening up the rook on f1.

**9...dxe5**

This position can also arise from a 7. f4 d6 8. fxe5 dxe5 9. Bg5 Be6 move order.

**10.Na3**

White is again happy enough to see exchanges, so long as they are exchanges on his own terms.

Invariably played, as

**10...Bxc4 11.Nxc4**

merely brings White's knight into play, although here

**11...Ne6 12.Bxf6 gxf6**

offered exchanges in Majdan-Vajda, Paks 2009, where even

**13.c3!? Qxd1 14.Raxd1 Ke7 15.Ne3**

was possible, retaining ongoing compensation due to Black's holes on f5 and d5 (or d6 after ...c6).

## Italian 3...Bc5 #3

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.O-O Nf6 5.d4 Bxd4 6.Nxd4 Nxd4 7.Bg5 d6 8.f4 Be6 9.fxe5 dxe5 10.Na3**

**10...Qe7 11.c3**

Black often can't resist trading a pair of pieces, but

**11...Nc6**

is an important move too. Following

**12.Kh1!**

Prudently side-stepping the check on c5. White might also consider the related idea 12.Rf2!?

**12...Bxc4? 13.Bxf6 Qe6**

is an independent option granted by this move order, but

**14.Nxc4 Qxc4 15.Bxg7 Rg8 16.Bf6 Qxe4 17.Qd2**

When White has a nice plus with Rae1 coming.

The game Berger-Fodor, German League 2012, continued 17...Rg6 18.Rae1 Qc4 19.Bxe5 Nxe5 20.Rxe5+ Kf8 21.Qf2 with a decisive advantage due to the more secure king and rampaging heavy pieces in an open position. The rook on a8 is not participating in the game.

## Italian 3...Bc5 #4

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.O-O Nf6 5.d4 Bxd4 6.Nxd4 Nxd4 7.Bg5 d6 8.f4 Be6 9.fxe5 dxe5 10.Na3**

**10...Qe7 11.c3**

Prodding the knight.

**11...Bxc4 12.Bxf6!**

An important exchange. 12.Nxc4 Ne6 13.Bxf6 has been known to be not so accurate due to 13...Qc5+! ever since Mestel-Szmetan, Buenos Aires Olympiad 1978.

**12...gxf6 13.Nxc4 Ne6 14.Ne3!?**

A simple choice and a move which might surprise a booked-up opponent, the prophylactic 14.b4 having been White's most popular choice.

**14...Qc5 15.Qd2**

Defending the knight and not fearing Black's next as the queen would like to slide across to f2.

**15...Ng5?**

might appear annoying and even tempted an experienced grandmaster who should have known better, but

**16.Rad1! Nxe4 17.Qd7+ Kf8**

would have been rather bad news for Black in Gukesh-Aleksandrov, Mumbai 2019, had White now gone

**18.Rd3**

The threat is Qf5 and the brave

**18...Rg8 19.Qf5 Nd6 20.Qxh7! f5 21.Rf2**

is actually just very good for White. Black's pawns might be mobile, but they can be dealt with and his king is just in some trouble: for example, after 21...f4 22.Nd5 e4 23.Rd4 e3 or

23...f3 24.Nf6 Rxg2+? 25.Rxg2 fxg2 26.Nd7+<level/>

24.Rfxf4 e2 25.Qh6+ Rg7 26.Kf2! Re8 27.Ke1 halting the e-pawn and leaving Black lost in view of the threat of Rg4.

## Italian 3...Nf6 #1

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.d4**

Breaking immediately and a much better-timed advance than 4.O-O?! Nxe4 5.d4 when Black has 5...d5.

**4...exd4**

Invariably Black captures so.

**5.O-O Nxe4**

A critical choice as Black goes two pawns to the good.

**6.Re1**

The pin ensures that White will quickly regain a pawn.

**6...d5**

Very much the normal choice.

6...f5? 7.Bg5 Be7 8.Bxe7 Qxe7 9.Nbd2 is just too risky for Black, as we saw in the notes to Li Chao - Wang Yu.

And after 6...Be7? 7.Rxe4 d5 8.Rxe7+! Nxe7 9.Bb3 c5 10.c3! White's minor pieces should prove somewhat more powerful than Black's additional rook, not least in the event of 10...dxc3 11.Nxc3 d4? 12.Ng5! O-O 13.Qh5, which would already be pretty much decisive.

**7.Bxd5**

A little tactic to regain the pawn and speed up White's development.

**7...Qxd5 8.Nc3 Qh5**

One of Black's main moves here, the other being 8...Qa5 (analyzed in the main course). With 8...Qh5 Black hopes to trade queens should White recapture his pawn on d4 and may also have aims against the white king, not that he's exactly about to start an attack.

**9.Nxe4**

The right recapture with the rook hanging and 9.Rxe4+ Be6 10.Nxd4 Qxd1+ 11.Nxd1 not the most desirable of exchanges.

**9...Be7**

when again White should keep up the pressure with

**10.Bg5 Be6**

Black has often rushed to add further ballast to the e-file here.

**11.Bxe7 Kxe7?!**

Even 11...Nxe7 12.Nxd4 is rather pleasant for White, with the typically strong central pressure, as we'll see in Chigorin-Janowski, Paris 1900.

**12.Neg5!**

is even stronger than recapturing on d4 followed by a structure-shattering exchange on c6. The threat is Nxe6 fxe6; Rxe6+! and after

**12...Rhe8**

12...Qg4? tries to overprotect e6, but after 13.Qd3 White had ideas of Re4 and doubling, as well as of Qb5 and simply Rad1 in Stoltz-Almgren, Uppsala 1923.

**13.b4!?**

Keeping up the pressure so appears stronger than allowing Black's king to slip away with 13.Nxe6 fxe6 14.Rxe6+ Kf8!

**13...a6**

13...Nxb4? 14.Qxd4 hits the knight and g7, and if 14...Nxc2 15.Qc5+,

while 13...Kf8?! 14.b5 Na5 15.Qxd4 Kg8 16.Re5 would leave White dominating the board.

**14.a4!**

Black merely has a choice of ways to suffer, as shown by

**14...h6 15.Nxe6 fxe6 16.Rb1**

when White will get b5 in, as

**16...b5?**

would create a loose piece on c6 and fail to

**17.Rxe6+! Kd7 18.Rxc6! Kxc6? 19.Nxd4+**

## Italian 3...Nf6 #2

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.d4 exd4 5.O-O Nxe4 6.Re1 d5 7.Bxd5 Qxd5 8.Nc3 Qh5 9.Nxe4**

**9...Be6**

Black usually counters the threat of Nf6+ like so.

**10.Bg5**

Not for the first time it makes sense to prevent Black from castling. With the queen on h5, 10.Neg5?! O-O-O 11.Nxe6 fxe6 12.Rxe6 Bd6 would just be rather nice for Black.

Black's second most common move has been

**10...h6**

which presumably overlooks

**11.Bf6!**

when matters aren't at all easy for him:

**11...Qg6**

but then

**12.Nh4! Qh7**

is a pretty horrible square for the queen and has been punished surprisingly little by

**13.Qd3!**

with ideas of Rad1, Qb5 and especially f4-f5, while

**13...Bb4**

can be met by the lovely

**14.c3! dxc3 15.bxc3 Bd6 16.Nf5!**

when Black is pretty much forced to suffer after

**16...O-O 17.Nxg7**

## Italian 3...Nf6 #3

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6**

Just a quick reminder that play transposes in the event of 3...Bc5 4.O-O Nf6 5.d4 exd4 6.e5

**4.d4 exd4 5.O-O**

**5...Bc5 6.e5 Ng4?!**

is at least a better square for the knight than e4. You might be tempted by

7.Bxf7+?!, but Black is OK after 7...Kxf7 8.Ng5+ Kg8 9.Qxg4 h6, so White should maintain his bridgehead with

**7.Bf4!**

Black has tended to want to avoid a shattered kingside by reacting in the centre, but if Black plays without care by:

**7...O-O!? 8.h3 Nh6 9.Bxh6 gxh6**

is a position we imagine few opponents would want to defend. Initially the engines aren't so convinced, but after

**10.c3!**

they begin to grasp White's trumps, with

**10...dxc3**

or 10...d5 11.Bb3 followed by recapturing on d4 with an ideal centre

**11.Nxc3 d6 12.Ne4!**

one route to a definite plus, and if

**12...Bf5 13.Nxc5 dxc5 14.Qe2**

Keeping the Queens on, and connecting rooks.

**14...Qe7 15.Qe3 Kg7 16.Bd5**

with excellent positional compensation, Bxc6 and Rac1 being the immediate threat.

## Italian 3...Nf6 #4

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.d4 exd4 5.O-O Bc5 6.e5**

**6...d5**

Invariably played and quite simply Black's best defence, as even Max Lange's opponents realised in the 1850s.

**7.exf6!**

Upping the ante and ensuring that the initiative belongs to White.

**7...dxc4**

Already we have a rather unusual pawn configuration on the board, not to mention rather a fun imbalance. Now Max Lange always checked on e1, which remains the main line, but isn't best.

**8.fxg7 Rg8 9.Bg5!**

First played in Fahrni-Tartakower, Baden-Baden 1914, this rapid developing move may catch out some opponents at club level who are only familiar with the check.

Neither is

**9...Qd6?**

at all advisable on account of

**10.Re1+ Be6 11.Nbd2**

when once again White's queen's knight rather has the upper hand in its duel with Black's queen. The threat is Ne4-f6+ and

**11...Qd5 12.Ne4 Be7**

doesn't fully solve Black's difficulties in view of the sly

**13.Bf6!**

Now castling queenside would cost Black the exchange and

**13...Qd8**

leaves White with a number of strong continuations, including the simple 14.Bxe7 Qxe7 15.Nxd4, but we prefer

**14.Bxd4 Nxd4 15.Nxd4**

Now moving the bishop from e6 would allow mate in one and even

**15...Rxg7 16.Nxe6 fxe6 17.Qf3 Rf7 18.Qh5**

## Italian 3...Nf6 #5

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.d4 exd4 5.O-O Bc5 6.e5 d5 7.exf6! dxc4 8.fxg7 Rg8 9.Bg5!**

**9...f6?!**

but this is still a move that White should welcome. White has often gone in for the immediate 10.Bh6 of late, which is promising, but there's no reason to avoid

**10.Re1+ Kf7**

and what else?, only that here we should be aware that 11.Ne5+? Nxe5 12.Rxe5 Bd6! leaves White with nothing better than 13.Qh5+ and perpetual check. Help is at hand in the shape of

**11.Bh6**

Talk about brave, as Black meets the threat of Nh4 by provoking the move. He has tended to prefer something safer, but even

**11...Re8!**

leaves him worse after

**12.Nbd2!? Rxe1+ 13.Nxe1!**

White opens the Queen's diagonal towards the kingside.

**13...Qd5 14.Nxc4!**

when the knight is taboo due to the check on h5 and it still is after

**14...Kg6 15.Bf4**

when Black should just take on g7 and be slightly worse after 16.b3 on account of his broken structure rather than lose on the spot to<addz start="16.b3"/>

**15...Qxc4?? 16.Qd3+! Qxd3 17.g8=Q+**

And White will be up a Queen after Nxd3.

## Italian 3...Nf6 #6

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.d4 exd4 5.O-O Bc5 6.e5 d5 7.exf6! dxc4 8.fxg7 Rg8 9.Bg5!**

**9...Be7!**

As found by Tartakower and Black's best move.

**10.Bxe7**

Once again leaving the rook on f1 to force Black to be quite accurate.

Likewise, White welcomes

**10...Nxe7?!**

when his best move is actually

**11.Qxd4!**

because after

**11...Qxd4 12.Nxd4 Rxg7**

there's

**13.Nb5!**

Black doesn't have to give up a pawn here, but

**13...Nd5**

A similar scenario occurring after 13...Kd8?! 14.Rd1+ Bd7 15.N5a3 c5 16.Nxc4 in Atabayev-Navalgund, Moscow 2017

**14.N1c3!**

This sees the tactics favoring White:

**14...Nxc3 15.Nxc7+! Kd8 16.Nxa8**

when, due to the open central files, Black isn't in time to save his knight and win the one in the corner, and 16...Bh3 17.bxc3 Bxg2 18.Rfd1+ Kc8 19.f4 should just be winning for White: for example, 19...Bf3+ 20.Kf2 Bxd1 21.Rxd1 b6 22.f5 Rg5 23.Rd5 Kb7 24.Rd7+ Kxa8 25.Rxf7 when the f-pawn will prove too strong.

## Petroff #1

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6**

The solid Petroff Defence. These days your opponent is likely to be either expecting the main line with 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5 6.Bd3 or here the fashionable 5.Nc3 variation, but White has another aggressive choice, and one with plenty of grandmaster supporters.

**3.d4**

Perhaps surprisingly this direct central challenge is seen some four and a half times less than 3.Nxe5 on the database, and is even somewhat less common than 3.Nc3.

We did, of course, give some consideration to the Cochrane Gambit, but unfortunately after 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nxf7!? Kxf7, while White does have some compensation for the piece, he doesn't lead in development, which is something we strive to do throughout this repertoire.

**3...Nxe4**

Black's most popular choice when he is likely to be expecting 4. Bd3...

**4.dxe5**

Our favorite capture and one which may gain you some time on the clock, it being about six times less popular than the main line, 4.Bd3.

**4...Bc5**

Clearly the critical move, if not one for the faint-hearted.

**5.Bc4!**

White wastes no time teeing up play against f7 and now Black has to tread quite a narrow path.

**5...d5?**

On occasion Black has sought to disrupt White's attack this way.

**6.Qxd5 Qxd5 7.Bxd5 Bxf2+ 8.Kf1 f5 9.exf6 Nxf6**

This sequence leaves White able to strongly force the pace:

**10.Kxf2! Nxd5 11.Re1+**

Black's king is in trouble, as can be seen in the following lines:

11...Kf8? 12.Rd1! either wins material or leaves Black terribly tied up: 12...Be6 13.c4 Nf6 14.Rd8+ Ne8 15.b3!, 16.Ba3+ follows or 15...Ke7 16.Bg5+ Kf8 17.Nc3 and Re1 with a decisive initiative.<addz start="16.Ba3+"/>

11...Kf7 12.Ne5+ Kf6 13.b3! This is again a sneaky switch of direction to bring the bishop powerfully into play, although Black can stay afloat, at least for now: 13...Nb4 14.Na3 N8c6 15.Bb2 Nxe5 16.Rxe5 Kg6. However, after 17.Kg1! followed by Re7, Re3 or Rf1, it's hard to believe that he should be able to survive in the long run.

## Petroff #2

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.d4 Nxe4 4.dxe5 Bc5 5.Bc4!**

**5...Nxf2!**

Greedy, and best.

In the game Almasi-Giri, which is analyzed in the main course, we will see that 5...Bxf2+? 6.Kf1 would be pretty unwise for Black.

**6.Bxf7+! Kf8?**

Here White should go

**7.Qd5 Nxh1**

when he can do even better than 8.Qxc5+ with

**8.Bh5!**

Black is practically forced into

**8...Qe7**

or 8...Bf2+ 9.Ke2 Qe7 10.Bg5 transposing

**9.Bg5**

Everything comes with tempo!

**9...Bf2+ 10.Ke2 Qe6**

But even this isn't ideal for Black since after

**11.Nc3**

White will regain a piece, leaving him with dangerous compensation for the exchange. He has scored 4/4 from here in practice:

**11...h6 12.Bd2 g6 13.Rxh1 Bb6 14.Rf1**

White's last move pretty much forces

**14...Qxd5 15.Nxd5**

15.Nh4+!? is also fairly effective.

**15...gxh5 16.Nh4+ Ke8 17.Nf6+ Kd8 18.Ng6**

which trapped the rook to leave White clearly better. A sample game went 18...d6 19.Nxh8 Be6 20.b3 Nc6 21.exd6 cxd6 22.h3! when Black's kingside continued to collapse in Nogga-E.Popov, correspondence 2021.

18...Re8? 19.Nxe8 Kxe8? 20.Rf8#

## Philidor 3...Bg4

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.Bc4!?**

Consistent with our approach against 2...Nc6 and a move which may surprise some opponents, 3. d4 being such a popular response to the Philidor.

**3...Bg4?!**

isn't quite as bad as after 3. d4, in the sense that Black shouldn't lose an Opera House-type game, but

**4.d4!**

is still very pleasant for White:

**4...Nd7 5.h3 Bh5 6.dxe5!?**

Simple chess and an exchange which may cause your opponent to sink into deep thought, but 6.Nc3 Ngf6 7.Be3 is a decent alternative, followed by Qe2 and g4 to sideline Black's bishop.

**6...dxe5**

is a safe recapture when White should be content with a pleasant edge after

**7.Qe2 Ngf6 8.O-O c6 9.Rd1**

He will manoeuvre his queen's knight towards f1 and exploit Black's offside bishop with g4: for example,

**9...Qc7 10.a4**

keeping any counterplay with ...b5 under control

**10...Be7 11.Nbd2 O-O**

when White can go 12. Nf1 and 13. Ng3 or be more direct with

**12.g4!? Bg6 13.Nh4**

intending Nf1-g3 or Nxg6 hxg6; Nf3, after which White might yet launch a direct attack with a timely h4-h5.

## Philidor 3...Be6

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.Bc4!?**

**3...Be6?!**

a panacea for Black on account of

**4.Bxe6 fxe6 5.d4!**

spurning structural concerns to open lines and attack. Black can maintain a centre, but not equalise in view of

**5...exd4 6.Nxd4 e5? 7.Ne6 Qe7 8.Qh5+ g6 9.Qh3**

left White with an ideal octopus-like knight and ideas of both Nc3-d5 and Bg5 followed by 0-0 and f4 in Chandler-Large, Hastings 1986/87.

## Philidor: 3...c6

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.Bc4!?**

**3...c6?!**

is a typical Philidor move, but a little early here:

**4.d4**

Overprotecting e5. Black rarely wants to combine ...c6 with

**4...exd4!?**

and even here

**5.Qxd4 Nd7 6.Nc3 Ngf6 7.Bf4**

looks rather nice for White, with ideas of e5 and O-O-O on the table.

## Philidor: 3...h6 #1

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.Bc4!?**

**3...h6?!**

Perhaps remarkably, this slow move is actually Black's second most popular choice on the database - testimony to the surprise value of 3. Bc4.

**4.d4!**

Naturally White rushes to open lines and exploit the slow nature of 3...h6.

**4...exd4 5.c3!?**

Danish or Scotch Gambit-like play. There's also nothing wrong with simply 5. Nxd4, as per how we develop elsewhere against the Philidor.

In practice, Black might try to return the pawn to keep lines closed, but

**5...d3 6.O-O**

still leaves White with a 3-0 lead in development and pleasantly better after, for instance,

**6...Nc6 7.Qxd3 Nf6 8.Bf4 Be7 9.Nbd2**

followed by h3 and centralising both rooks to leave Black quite cramped.

## Philidor: 3...h6 #2

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.Bc4!? h6?! 4.d4! exd4 5.c3!?**

**5...dxc3 6.Nxc3**

A simple recapture and a move which hopes to provoke 6...Nf6 in response, but with Black so far behind in development you may even prefer 6.O-O!? cxb2 7.Bxb2 with a promising version of the Danish.

**6...Nc6 7.O-O**

Simple development now that 7.Qb3 can be met well enough by 7...Qd7,

although there is also 7.b4!?

while

**7...Bg4**

offers White a number of options. There's even the simple

**8.h3!? Bxf3 9.Qxf3 Ne5 10.Qe2 Nxc4 11.Qxc4**

when his lead in development very much continues to count, as we can see from

**11...Nf6 12.Rd1! Be7 13.e5 Nd7 14.exd6 Bxd6 15.Re1+ Kf8 16.Ne4**

with quite some initiative down the central files and more than enough play for the pawn.

## Sicilian Wing Gambit 3...b3 #1

**1.e4 c5 2.b4!?**

The Wing Gambit. White takes the fight to Black from the second move and unlike with the Morra,

2.d4 cxd4 3.c3, he doesn't cede a centre pawn in the process.

**2...cxb4**

Black usually accepts. Indeed, he has done so in roughly four in every five games on the database. If, however, he wishes to decline there are a number of options, if many of them good for White. Without a knight on f3 to challenge,

2...Nc6?! 3.b5 doesn't make too much sense for Black, and neither does

2...g6? 3.bxc5 when White can simply meet 3...Bg7 with 4.d4

**3.a3**

White wastes no time challenging the pawn on b4, seeking to open lines on the queenside before considering a central advance with d4.

**3...b3!?**

Black meekly returns the pawn in a bid to keep lines closed. The main line is

3...d5 4.exd5, as we'll cover in the main course. Instead,

3...e5 4.Nf3 can also lead to quite sharp play, as we'll again see in the main course,

and 3...bxa3 4.Nxa3 receives its separate chapter as well.

**4.cxb3**

White might as well regain the pawn, which reaches a highly original situation.

**4...d5**

Black usually reacts so in Scandinavian fashion.

**5.exd5**

Consistently striving to open lines and refusing to fear the resulting IQP.

**5...Nf6 6.Nf3**

Again White commences kingside development as quickly as possible. You can also begin with 6.Bb2 and only then go Nf3.

6.Bb5+ doesn't seem quite so effective in view of 6...Nbd7 followed by ...g6.

**6...Nxd5 7.Bb2**

If you don't mind a queenless middlegame with easy development and a queenside majority then 7.Nc3!? Nxc3 8.dxc3 Qxd1+ 9.Kxd1 is a decent alternative, as in Golubka-Isajevsky, Internet (blitz) 2020.

**7...Nc6 8.Nc3**

White's bishop radiates power from b2 and this is an IQP position where Black must be careful not to become too ambitious, as we can see from

**8...Bg4 9.h3 Bh5**

when 10.g4 isn't so clear, but there is

**10.Nxd5 Qxd5 11.Bc4!?**

There's also nothing wrong with 11.Be2 and 0-0 if you prefer to keep pieces on.

**11...Qe4+ 12.Qe2 Bxf3 13.gxf3 Qxe2+ 14.Kxe2**

Of course, White's structure isn't too pretty, but his bishop-pair and lead in development are handy assets, with Rac1 next up, likely followed by b4 or Bb5.

## Sicilian Wing Gambit 3...b3 #2

**1.e4 c5 2.b4!? cxb4 3.a3 b3!? 4.cxb3 d5 5.exd5**

**5...Qxd5 6.Nc3 Qe6+?!**

comes with tempo:

**7.Be2 Nf6 8.Nf3 Nc6 9.d4**

already saw White seizing the initiative in Toshev-Filipov, Bulgarian Championship, Sofia 1948.

## Sicilian Wing Gambit 3...b3 #3

**1.e4 c5 2.b4!? cxb4 3.a3 b3!? 4.cxb3**

**4...e5?! 5.Nf3 Nc6 6.Bb2**

is rather attractive for White, followed by d4 or

**6...Nf6 7.Nxe5! Nxe5 8.Bxe5 Nxe4 9.Qe2**

which pretty much forces a situation like

**9...d5 10.Nc3!**

against d5 as well as e4; 10.d3 Qe7 isn't as effective.

**10...Qe7 11.Bd4 Nxc3 12.Qxe7+ Bxe7 13.dxc3**

cementing the bishop in place with a very pleasant edge after

**13...O-O 14.Bd3 Re8 15.Kd2 Bg5+ 16.Kc2**

followed by Rae1 and/or an advance of the kingside pawns.

## Sicilian Wing Gambit 3...e6 #1

**1.e4 c5 2.b4!? cxb4 3.a3**

**3...e6**

Now play often goes 4.axb4 Bxb4 5.c3 Be7 6.d4. That can hardly be terrible, but we prefer

**4.d4!?**

and if

**4...d5**

After 4...bxa3 Greco recaptured with the bishop back in 1620(!), and there's also 5.Nxa3, transposing to a position that's covered in the main course.

**5.e5**

The position closely resembles the Wing Gambit against the French 1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5!? c5 4.b4 but here White hasn't had to play Nf3 and, as such, may well have an improved version. Play may continue

**5...bxa3 6.c3**

Keeping Black out of b4 ahead of recapturing the pawn.

**6...Bd7 7.Nxa3 Ne7 8.Bd3 a6 9.Ne2**

Leaving the f-pawn free to advance.

**9...Nbc6**

In Mariotti-Larsen, Milan 1975, White went

10.h4!?

**10.O-O**

Is also pretty sensible:

**10...Na5 11.Ng3 Rc8 12.Nb1!?**

Unable to leap into b5, the knight heads back to base, protecting c3 for now while intending to re-emerge on f3 one day.

**12...Nc4 13.Nh5**

with kingside pressure and promising compensation. Even Bh6 is a possibility, as well as simply Nd2, with the f4-f5 pawn break always in reserve.

## Advance French 5...Nge7 #1

**1.e4 e6 2.d4**

There's no reason not to take the space on offer when confronted with the French Defence.

**2...d5 3.e5**

Consistent and a pretty decent choice as we prepare to play a fashionable and until recently little-known gambit.

**3...c5**

Played in about 98% of games, Black strikes back without delay in the centre.

**4.c3**

Maintaining the strong point on d4 and so support of the key e5-pawn.

**4...Nc6 5.Nf3**

Natural development, as White also overprotects d4 which Black now tends to continue to attack.

**5...Nge7**

Black's third most common move, if also one which lags a substantial way behind 5...Qb6 when our suggestion is 6.Bd3, preparing to offer the Milner-Barry Gambit, though we are seeking a superior version of the main line.

5...Bd7 is about half as popular as 5...Qb6. Here too ( as we explain in the larger course) our suggested move is 6.Bd3.

**6.Bd3**

As in our other lines against the French, White develops the light-squared bishop to its most active square.

**6...cxd4 7.cxd4**

Simple chess. In general, we are looking to gambit the d4-pawn, but in this guise

7.O-O?! dxc3 8.Nxc3 doesn't give White quite enough compensation after 8...Ng6.

**7...Nf5**

The solid point of Black's play. There's nothing amazingly aggressive available for White here, but we can at least make a structurally favourable exchange.

**8.Bxf5 exf5 9.Nc3**

Developing the queen's knight to its most active square. Another popular choice has been 9.O-O, but we're actually planning to delay castling.

**9...Be6**

Invariably played, as Black puts the bishop to immediate defensive work, overprotecting d5.

**10.Bg5!?**

An aggressive choice and one which may surprise opponents, White usually preferring to castle or begin a classic maneuver with Ne2.

**10...Qd7 11.h4!**

We'll see much more of Harry advancing so later in this anti-French repertoire. Here the advance is simply good prophylaxis against Black's planned expansion with ...h6 and ...g5.

**11...h6 12.Bf4 Be7**

We've followed the game Shirov-Goryachkina, Internet (blitz) 2020, where the Latvian wizard couldn't resist after 13.Qd2 Rc8 going 14.Rh3!?. However, as the queen is a little vulnerable on d2 to...Na5-c4 ideas, we'd prefer to start with

**13.Kf1!? Rc8 14.Rh3**

White simply wants to exert some pressure against g7 and h6 after Rg3 and should be on the lookout for both Ng5+ ideas should Black's king go to h7 and those of Ne2, Be3 and Nf4, simply bringing another piece over to the kingside.

## Advance French 5...Nge7 #2

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 Nge7 6.Bd3 cxd4 7.cxd4 Nf5 8.Bxf5 exf5 9.Nc3 Be6 10.Bg5!?**

**10...Qb6 11.O-O! h6**

as his opponent Aleksandra Goryachkina had earlier deployed:

**12.Bd2!?**

This intends Na4, Rc1 and Nc5.

and

**12...g5 13.h4! g4 14.Ne1**

is also fairly pleasant for White followed by Be3 and Nd3-f4 or

**14...Qxd4 15.Nb5 Qb6 16.Nd6+ Bxd6 17.exd6**

## Advance French 5...f6 #1

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3**

**5...f6 6.Bd3**

already feels a little risky for Black:

**6...Qc7 7.Bf4!?**

White actually has a fairly pleasant choice here, the alternative being a simple pull with 7.O-O fxe5 8.dxe5 when c4 may follow.

**7...Qb6 8.Qe2 cxd4 9.O-O**

Even here Black may find himself having overextended:

**9...dxc3? 10.Nxc3**

This not only menaces ideas of Nb5, but even carries a threat, as shown by

**10...Bd7? 11.Nxd5! exd5 12.exf6+ Kd8 13.Ng5**

White either gets Nf7+ in or is left with too strong an attack:

**13...Nh6 14.Ne6+ Bxe6 15.Qxe6**

## Advance French 5...Nh6 #1

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3**

**5...Nh6!?**

, as first advocated by John Watson in 'Dangerous Weapons: The French'. We suggest avoiding an exchange on h6, no matter how tempting it may appear, and recommend simple development:

**6.Bd3 Nf5 7.O-O cxd4 8.Bxf5**

Damaging Black's structure as per our main line and, unfortunately, we're not convinced that 8.cxd4 Nfxd4 9.Nxd4 Nxd4 offers us enough compensation, and if 10.Qg4 Nc6.

**8...exf5 9.Nxd4!**

This exploits Black's move order to make active use of the knight on f3 9.cxd4 doesn't transpose to our main line as there we're looking to delay castling as White:

**9...Be7 10.f4!**

followed by Be3 looks quite pleasant for White:

**10...Nxd4 11.Qxd4 b6 12.Be3 O-O 13.Qd3**

This prepared Nd2-f3-d4 in Thorhallsson-Einarsson, Reykjavik 1993.

## Hillbilly Attack 3...e5 #1

**1.e4 c6 2.Bc4!?**

The Hillybilly Attack, preparing to take aim at f7 in return for a pawn.

**2...d5**

Invariably played and the standard Caro move, of course.

**3.Bb3!**

A gambit and we were a little pained to discover that the rather pointless exchange on d5 has been preferred almost four times as often on the database - a state of affairs which we hope will soon change! We should also say that already many opponents may well be on their own by now, the Hillbilly not featuring in Daniel Fernandez's otherwise excellent 2018 work, 'The Modernized Caro-Kann', or in Jovanka Houska and Cyrus Lakdawala's repertoire works on the Caro for Everyman Chess.

**3...e5**

prefers to take over the center, but is rather ambitious. White can hit back with 4.Nf3 or even a central counter:

**4.d4!?**

Refusing to allow Black to dominate. Once again, White's main idea is to get the queen out to h5:

**4...dxe4 5.Qh5! Qf6 6.Nc3!?**

Aiming for more than the exchange of queens on e5, as White preferred in Br.Thorfinnsson-Petursson, Selfoss 2019.

**6...exd4? 7.Nxe4 Qe7 8.Kf1!**

White prevents Black's threat and simply leaves him in some trouble:

**8...Nf6 9.Nxf6+ Qxf6 10.Bg5 Qg6 11.Re1+**

White enjoys a very serious initiative indeed.

## Hillbilly Attack 3...e5 #2

**1.e4 c6 2.Bc4!? d5 3.Bb3! e5**

prefers to take over the centre, but is rather ambitious. White can hit back with 4 Nf3 or even a central counter:

**4.d4!?**

Refusing to allow Black to dominate. Once again, White's main idea is to get the queen out to h5:

**4...dxe4 5.Qh5! Qf6 6.Nc3!?**

(Aiming for more than the exchange of queens on e5, as White preferred in Br.Thorfinnsson-Petursson, Selfoss 2019.)

Black might do relatively best with

**6...Qf5!? 7.Qxf5 Bxf5 8.dxe5 Nd7**

Once again quick development should be the order of the day for White and after

**9.Nge2! Nxe5 10.Ng3 Bg6 11.h4!? h5 12.Ngxe4 O-O-O 13.O-O**

White's lead in development is not to be sniffed at, as shown by

**13...Nh6 14.Be3**

when Black must either weaken his queenside or allow

**14...Kb8 15.Bf4 f6 16.Rfe1**

when he is under pressure with Ng5 one idea for White.

## Hillbilly Attack 3...Nf6 #1

**1.e4 c6 2.Bc4!? d5 3.Bb3!**

**3...Nf6?!**

was Black's choice when Nihal Sarin tried the Hillbilly. The Indian wunderkind showed how White should play, seizing space:

**4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4!?**

One might also make a decent case for 5.d4 then c3.

**5...Nc5 6.Nf3 Bg4 7.h3 Bxf3 8.Qxf3**

An ideal, aggressive set-up for White who is all ready to roll forwards with d4 and f5.

**8...Qb6 9.Nc3 Nbd7 10.d4! Nxb3 11.axb3 e6 12.Be3 c5 13.O-O-O Rc8? 14.f5**

White was already crashing through down the f-file in Nihal-Cezila, Internet (blitz) 2020.

## Hillbilly Attack 3...g6 #1

**1.e4 c6 2.Bc4!? d5 3.Bb3!**

Finally, just as in the main line Caro, a fianchetto is possible:

**3...g6**

White has tried 4.e5,

**4.Qf3**

And even 4.h4, but we quite like simple development:

**4.Nf3!? Bg7**

4...dxe4 5.Ng5 regains the pawn while opening lines.

**5.O-O**

Facilitating ...Ne7 and ...dxe4. Instead,

**5...Bg4 6.h3 Bxf3 7.Qxf3 e6 8.c3!? Ne7 9.d4**

should be fairly pleasant for White with his bishops and ideas like Bg5, Qe3 and Nd2-f3.

## Pirc #1

**1.e4 d6 2.d4**

Naturally we seize the central space Black is offering us.

**2...Nf6 3.Nc3**

Another highly natural and standard move, developing while meeting the threat.

**3...g6 4.Be2!?**

But this modest move may come as a small surprise to your opponent. It is somewhat behind 4.f4, 4.Nf3 and 4.Be3, as well as 4.Bg5 and 4.f3 in the popularity stakes, but isn't White just going to go Nf3 next and transpose to the Classical lines? Well...

4.h4!? is the alternative move order. This may well jolt your opponent awake, but it is likely to transpose to our main lines in this chapter once White follows up with Be2. 4...Bg7 Now

5.Be2 transposes to the mainline, while those of a very aggressive bent may also wish to consider 5.h5!?

**4...Bg7**

The logical follow-up to Black's last and one seen in more than 95% of all games.

**5.h4!**

5.g4 and 5.Be3 are far from ridiculous, but we can resist no longer: Harry is deployed. This direct thrust may well come as a surprise to your opponent and even if they have seen it before, such a direct assault is not always so easy to face.

Moreover, while that great attacking force of recent times, Baadur Jobava, has championed White's cause here, his position has also appealed to such players as Kapengut, Keres and Spassky, as well as Benjamin, Nakamura and even Kasparov.

**5...Nbd7?!**

Natural enough development from Black, if also rather compliant. In our detailed coverage ahead, we'll consider his main alternatives in descending order of popularity, which are: 5...O-O 6.h5 rather castles into it and is considered in Line A1.

5...h6 6.h5! is another position White most certainly welcomes - see more details in the main course.

5...c6 6.h5 once more rolls ahead - see see more details in the main course.

5...Nc6 is the first of Black's main defenses, or at least ones used by leading Pirc exponents. Here too though White can keep going: 6.h5 is covered in chapter 4 in the main course.

5...c5 is Black's best attempt to obtain immediate counterplay and has been by some margin his second most popular move. White's d-pawn has two options and we'll focus on 6.dxc5 in other chapter .

5...h5 is Black's most sensible move and by some margin his most popular, having been seen in a little over 40% of games to have reached this position. As we should always be asking ourselves, what's the downside to the move? 6.Nf3 reveals it. White will look to settle his knight on the newly weakened g5-square, as we'll see in another chapter in the main course.

Black's remaining options are pretty rare, including 5...d5?. This works well against 5. g4, but not here: 6.e5 Ne4 7.h5!? Trading knights then go h4-h5 is also pretty good. 7...gxh5 8.Bxh5.Taking aim at f7. Once again we find White looking to manoeuvre his king's knight from g1 to g5: 8...Nxc3 9.bxc3 Bf5. This was Hausner-B.Houska, Policka 1997, where White had a very strong continuation: 10.Qf3! Bg6

5...e5? once again leads to exchanges down the d-file which White should most certainly welcome: 6.dxe5 dxe5 7.Qxd8+ Kxd8. Now 8 h5 is on and there's something likely even stronger: 8.Nf3! With tempo, and f7, not e5, is the main target. 8...Nbd7 R.Lamprecht-Pribyl, Bad Griesbach 2007

5...b6?! is an approach which can work against slower white set-ups, but not here: 6.h5 Bb7 7.Bf3 Sensible defense of e4 and a move which also lines up various nasty tactics along the long diagonal, but the engines' preference for the space-gaining 7. h6!? Bf8 8. d5! also makes a lot of sense. 7...Nbd7? 8.h6 Bf8 9.e5! Forcing the pace - and how! 9...Bxf3 10.Nxf3 Ng8 11.e6! The classic breakthrough, although it should be said that 11.Qe2!? is also very strong, and if 11...e6 12.d5!. 11...fxe6 12.Ng5 Ndf6 13.Nxe6 Qd7 14.Qe2. Talk about a dream opening for White or an octopus knight! Indeed, you could hardly blame Black for resigning here, unable to castle or develop his kingside.<level start="11.Qe2"/><level start="11...e6"/>

**6.h5**

Naturally, as allowed, White presses straight ahead.

**6...e5**

Once again, we see this break and, once again, it doesn't bring Black anywhere near to equality.

Of course, Black can exchange, but only at some cost to his kingside: 6...Nxh5 7.Bxh5 gxh5 8.Nge2 aims to land the knight on h5, as well as to complete development with Be3 and Qd2,

while 6...gxh5 7.Be3 makes good sense to dissuade ...c5. White may preface Qd2 with f3 or just go Bxh5. He can also simply rely on his lead in development, as shown by: 7...e5 (Ortega Serra-Lara Meca, Santa Eulalia de Roncana 2014) 8.Nf3!? Now Nh4-f5 becomes an idea. 8...Ng4 9.Bg5 f6 10.Bd2 and all that Black has achieved is to weaken his kingside light squares.

**7.h6!**

By no means the only good move (you may prefer to retain the tension with 7. Be3), but the first part in a bold, but seemingly very strong plan to squeeze Black to death.

**7...Bf8**

Here White simply developed with 8. Nf3 in Andreikin-Vavulin, Moscow Blitz Championship 2015, and 8. Be3 is again far from shabby, but White can be more ambitious:

**8.g4!? d5**

Desperately trying to break free.

**9.Bg5!**

White ignores the central tension and ratchets up the pressure by another notch.

**9...Be7**

Breaking the pin.

9...dxe4?? 10.dxe5 would already be game over.

9...exd4 10.Qxd4 Bc5 is a more immediately active try for Black, but unfortunately for him there's no really good follow-up: 11.Qd2 d4 12.Nd5 c6 13.Nxf6+ Nxf6

hopes for 14.e5 Qd5, which may still favour White, but he can also keep a large advantage through simple means: 14.O-O-O O-O 15.Qf4!? Be7 16.Qe5! c5 17.f4. Nf3 will follow and it's far from easy for Black to deal with the pressure down the h4-d8 diagonal without allowing a snap mate on g7. Indeed, it's not at all clear how Black can really do anything before he is swept aside after Nf3, Kb1, f5, Bf4 and g5.

**10.exd5 O-O 11.Qd2**

White is just a pawn to the good and also has a certain most useful fish bone lodged right in the black king's throat. Moreover, the d5-pawn is actually quite secure:

11...exd4 12.Qxd4 Nb6 13.O-O-O Here Rh3-e3 is one strong idea and it would be a minor miracle were Black to survive.

And if 11...e4 then 12.O-O-O Nb6 13.Bxf6! Bxf6 14.Nxe4 followed by c4.

## Pirc #2

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 O-O?!**

Fearless or foolhardy? In any case, White should welcome this and the chance to press straight ahead.

**6.h5 c5**

is one of Black's better defences when played a move earlier, but here White can do even better than seize some central space:

**7.hxg6 fxg6 8.dxc5**

Simple chess from White and now Black can either aim for some slightly desperate-looking counterplay or recapture and suffer:

**8...Qa5!?**

Or 8...dxc5 when 9.Bd2 isn't so effective as here Black does have 9...Nc6 10.Qc1 Nd4, but White can simply improve the pieces: 9.Qxd8! Rxd8 10.Be3. It transpires that c5 is from easy to defend, with O-O-O its way or yet another hit down the h1-a8 diagonal: 10...b6? 11.e5! Nd5 12.O-O-O e6 13.Bg5. Already the defense of d5 is overloaded in view of 13...Rd7 14.Bg4 Nc7 15.Bf3!.

**9.cxd6 exd6 10.Bd2**

Even stronger than the 10.Nf3!? Nxe4 11.Qd5+ of Smejkal-Boehnisch, Sinaia 1965.<level/>

10...Qb6 11.Nf3 is also excellent for White, not least with b2 taboo: 11...Qxb2? 12.Rb1 Qa3 13.Nb5

## Pirc #3

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 h6?!**

This is viable against an early h4 in some lines of the Modern and Pirc and has even been used by Mamedyarov and Hillarp Persson, but it just doesn't quite cut the mustard here, as White can simply press ahead regardless.

**6.h5!**

Ploughing straight ahead is even stronger than simple development with Be3 followed by Qd2 when Black may struggle to safely house his king.

**6...g5**

Naturally Black has no desire to see his kingside structure weakened by an exchange on h5 or g6, so opts for a Grob-type kingside. The problem is that White isn't out of pawn breaks.

**7.f4!**

Smashing open lines.

**7...gxf4**

7...g4? 8.e5 dxe5 9.fxe5 wouldn't exactly be wise for Black.

**8.Bxf4 Nc6**

Trying to hit back against d4 or with the push ...e5.

**9.Nf3**

Probably best, simply continuing to develop whilst fighting for the key d4 and e5-squares. 9.Qd3 was preferred in Br.Thorfinnsson-Hillarp Persson, Akureyri 2019, when Black might have been able to restrict his losses with 9...Nxd4!? 10.Qxd4 e5.

**9...Bg4**

9...Nd7!? was preferred in Mestrovic-Bajramovic, Zenica 2003, when White cut across Black's ...e5 designs: 10.d5!? Nce5 11.Qd2 Black does have a firm grip on e5, but that's the end of the good news for him. White will castle queenside, with quite some lead in development. One simple plan is Nd4, another to force through g4-g5 after Rg1 and, if needed, Rh4.

**10.d5!**

Otherwise Black might be OK, but now he is beaten to the bounce.

**10...Nb8 11.e5!?**

Blasting straight ahead. 11.Nd2 is also very pleasant for White, as is 11.Nh4, which was seen in the all-grandmaster clash Rodriguez Vila-Spangenberg, Vicente Lopez 2002, where Black really needed to grovel with 11...Rg8.

**11...Nxh5 12.Bh2!**

is a calm, but very strong retreat. White simply threatens to move his knight from f3 and win material down the d1-h5 diagonal:

**12...dxe5 13.Nxe5 Bxe2 14.Qxe2 Nf6**

This saves the black knight, but his position remains a wreck:

**15.O-O-O**

White has much the safer king and far, far too much for the pawn. He might increase the pressure with Ne4 or Nc4 and d6, not to mention g4 and one other key motif:

**15...Nbd7 16.Nc6!**

## Pirc #4

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 c6?!**

A very common move in the Pirc, if here one which White should most certainly welcome.

**6.h5**

Needless to say, we press straight ahead.

**6...Rg8?!**

is also rather sub-optimal for Black. He frees a square for his bishop, but 7.h6 Bh8 8.Nf3 and Ng5 still looks pretty good for White, as does simple development:

**7.hxg6 hxg6 8.Nf3 Qa5 9.Bd2 Qb6**

This was Galego-Schou Moldt, Reykjavik 2014, where White prepared Be3 with 10. a3, but once again we prefer

**10.a4!?**

White seizes further space and may also eye f7:

**10...a5**

By now you should know the drill against 10...Qxb2?, although you likely did already: 11.Rb1 Qa3 12.Rb3.

**11.Bc4 Nbd7 12.Qe2**

Despite the presence of a pawn on a4, White can safely castle queenside as Black isn't about to attack. Moreover, Ng5 and f4 is now on its way, as well as simple crashing straight through with e4-e5 and, yes, b2 is still taboo: 12...Qxb2? 13.Rb1 Qxc2 14.Bb3 and once again the black queen has been trapped.

## Pirc #5

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 Nc6**

Black's third most popular move and one which has attracted a number of grandmaster adherents, albeit mainly back in the eighties.

As so often in the Pirc, 6.d5 Ne5 risks overextension for White and will lead to decent counter-chances for Black, while here one common response in general to ...Nc6,

namely 6.Bb5, would, of course, cost White a tempo.

**6.h5!**

We refuse to be intimidated and press ahead. White has scored 61% with this logical advance on the database, where, to our surprise, it's been fractionally less popular than 6.Be3.

**6...gxh5**

This slightly ugly capture is one of the main ideas behind 5...Nc6.

**7.Nh3!?**

White has tried a whole host of moves here. We've elected to go with a logical and pretty thematic move for the whole 4. Be2 and 5. h4 variation in the attempt to bring the king's knight to f4.

Of the alternatives, 7.Bxh5? clearly isn't wise with d4 weak, but all of 7.Be3, 7.Bg5 (the f6-knight will now be pinned after ...e5 ), and 7.f4!? have plenty going for them.

**7...e5!**

Preventing Nf4 so must be critical.

**8.dxe5!**

It's back to plan A, the simple and straightforward exchange, as here White has nothing too amazing after 8.d5 Nd4 followed by ...c6 or ...c5.

**8...dxe5**

This must be critical.

**9.Qxd8+ Nxd8 10.Nb5!**

Fighting for the initiative rather than allow Black to cover his main central weaknesses with 10.Bg5 c6!.

**10...Bxh3!**

Giving up the bishop-pair, but at least this way Black can cover c7 and obtain some play on the dark squares.

**11.Rxh3 Ne6 12.Bc4!**

White is happy to leave Black with a sickly extra pawn on h5 and instead wants to both maintain the initiative and weaken further the black structure.

**12...Kd7 13.Bxe6+!?**

As well as forcing the pace so, a pretty good case can be made for the calm 13.Be3, but 13.Rd3+ would only have supplied an edge in Nisipeanu-Itkis, Romania 1995, had Black found 13...Ke7!.

**13...fxe6 14.Rc3**

An unexpected, but strong attack. Black has no especially good way of dealing with the threat and is just somewhat worse. The tactics favour White after 14...Rhc8 15.Be3 Nxe4 16.Rd1+ Ke7 17.Rc4! Nf6 18.Nxa7

14...Ne8? 15.Bg5 followed by Rd1+

14...c6 15.Rd3+ Kc8

or 15...Ke7 16.Nd6 followed by Nxb7 or just Bg5 and Rad1.<level/>

16.Nd6+ Kc7 17.Bg5 Black has retained his extra pawn, but remains structurally worse with two sets of doubled pawns.

No less importantly, he continues to lack counterplay, while O-O-O will merely serve to augment White's bind on the position.

## Pirc #6

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 Nc6 6.h5!**

Bearing in mind what we've just seen after 6...Nxh5, you might wonder about an immediate central counterstrike from Black:

**6...e5?!**

However, it's too early for this in part because the h-pawn can again make a right nuisance of itself:

**7.h6! Bf8**

Now there are too good approaches, depending on your taste. The simple path is 8.dxe5, and if 8...dxe5 9.Qxd8+ Nxd8 10.Bg5 followed by Nf3, Bc4 and likely O-O-O, with somewhat the easier development for White. The slightly more complex path involves keeping pieces on:

**8.Nf3!? exd4**

8...Bg4?! 9.dxe5! is certainly now well-timed: 9...dxe5

9...Bxf3? 10.exf6! Bxe2 11.Qxe2 Qxf6 does not help Black to free his cramped position through exchanges, but rather leaves him under heavy pressure: 12.Nd5 Qd8 13.Qb5! Rb8 14.Bg5!. Already Black pretty much has to resign in view of 14...Qxg5 15.Nxc7+.<level/>

10.Qxd8+ Rxd8 11.Bg5 Seizing the initiative and preparing to invade on the weakest square in Black's camp, d5. 11...Be7 12.Bxf6! Bxf6 13.Nd5. We've followed some old analysis by Malaniuk, which he unsurprisingly assessed as clearly better for White, since c7 is falling with check.

**9.Nxd4 Be7 10.Be3**

Straightforward development, although a good case can also be made for placing the bishop on f4 or g5.

**10...O-O 11.Qd2 a6**

It's not hard to appreciate why Black was likely reticent about bringing the white queen closer to g7: 11...Nxd4 12.Qxd4 c6 13.O-O-O Be6 14.f4!. Once again, White enjoys an attractive attacking set-up with f4-f5 set to rip open lines.

**12.Nxc6!?**

12.O-O-O is also good, but there's no need to fear the half-open b-file and now ...Ne5 or ...Nxd4 never need be taken into account.

**12...bxc6 13.O-O-O**

We've followed the encounter Malaniuk-Guseinov, Kiev 1984, where White enjoyed a lovely set-up, with his f- and g-pawns set to cause havoc, not to mention that advanced, deadly fish bone wedged on h6 in the black king's throat. Play continued thematically with 13...a5 14.f3 Be6 15.g4 Qc8 16.g5! Nd7 17.f4! With the simple idea of Rdf1 and f4-f5

17...f6 18.Rdf1 Qd8 19.Bd4! and Black remains under extremely heavy pressure, with f4-f5 set to rip open lines, as would have been the case after 19...fxg5? 20.f5 Bf7 21.fxg6 Bxg6 22.Bc4+ with a winning attack, for instance: 22...Bf7 23.Rxf7 Rxf7 24.Rf1 d5 25.Rxf7 Kxf7 26.exd5

## Pirc #7

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Be2 Bg7 5.h4 c5**

Black strives for immediate counterplay and it's no surprise that this is one of his two main options. It's been the choice of Grischuk, Kramnik and Svidler at blitz, as well as of leading Pirc exponents Azmaiparashvili, Mikhail Gurevich, Hodgson and Marin in longplay games.

**6.dxc5**

Not for the first time we meet a central counter with an immediate exchange, as well as one which maintains a fair degree of control and supplies definite chances to emerge with the upper hand. Instead, 6.h5? no longer makes sense when 6...cxd4 is on and

6.e5 dxe5 7.dxe5 Qxd1+ 8.Bxd1 Ng4 seems to be fine for Black.<level/>

However, 6.d5!? is a very respectable alternative if you don't mind a Schmidt Benoni structure. The critical line to explore there is probably 6...O-O 7.h5 b5!?.

**6...Qa5**

Pinning so is a very typical device in such positions.

6...dxc5? 7.Qxd8+ Kxd8 8.Be3 just makes no sense for Black. Not only is the c5-pawn rather vulnerable, but its advance has weakened some key squares and just what is the black king doing on d8? White will quickly go O-O-O and perhaps even Nb5 or e4-e5 and Nd5.

**7.Bd2!?**

Simple chess. 7.cxd6 Nxe4 gives Black too much counterplay, although 7.Kf1!? can't be ridiculous in conjunction with the early h4. Notably the American GM Alex Sherzer once denoted our pin-breaking choice as dubious, an assessment with which we, Stockfish and Lc0 would like to disagree.

Like Joel Benjamin, Sherzer himself has preferred 7.Qd3 when 7...Qxc5 8.Be3 Qa5 can be met by 9.Qb5+, but this shouldn't lead to any advantage for White.

Instead, we simply break the pin with a choice described back in 2003 by Joe Gallagher in 'Starting Out: The Pirc/Modern', as 'less common, but more testing for Black'. Notably too the modest bishop development went unnoticed by Chernin and Alburt in their 2001 book 'Pirc Alert!'.

**7...Qxc5**

7...dxc5? still rather misses the point. White can just go 8.h5 or begin to squash Black with 8.e5 Nfd7 9.f4.

**8.h5! 8...a6**

can, likewise, be well met by 9.h6 and here another of our favourite ideas is also quite strong.

**9.Nh3 Nbd7 10.Nf4 b5? 11.h6!**

Finally!

**11...Bf8 12.a4! b4 13.Ncd5**

This already gave White a near decisive initiative in Garcia Fernandez-Wojtkiewicz, Valencia 1990, with both Bxb4 and Be3 set to cause major problems.

## Modern #1

**1.e4 g6**

The Modern Defence, against we can again take over the centre.

**2.d4**

As play may transpose to a Pirc after a subsequent ...Nf6, it makes sense for White to begin in the same manner as against the Pirc,

although if you like to go your own way early, 2.h4!? isn't completely ridiculous, as once covered by Colin McNab in Everyman's Dangerous Weapons series.

**2...Nf6?!**

is Magnus Carlsen's favourite surprise weapon against lower-rated opponents at blitz, the North Sea Defence:

**3.e5 Nh5**

3...Nd5?! 4.c4 Nb6 5.c5!? Nd5 6.Bc4 is just a bad version of an Alekhine for Black: 6...c6 7.Nf3 d6 8.exd6 exd6 9.O-O ! when Black will come under an early assault down the e-file, with Ng5 also likely to prove quite problematic for him.

**4.Be2**

Simple chess and consistent with our general approach. 4.Nf3 d6 5.Bc4 is also quite promising with Ng5 on its way.

**4...d6 5.f4!?**

Simple chess, seizing space. 5.Bxh5 gxh5 6.Qxh5?! dxe5 7.Qxe5 Rg8 actually offers Black good counterplay, but Caruana and Leko have made a decent case for the simple approach, 5.exd6.

**5...c5 6.d5**

also looks like a lot of fun for White with his powerful centre: for example,

**6...Ng7 7.Nf3 Nf5 8.c3**

Preparing a powerful g4 advance without Black being able to sacrifice a pawn for some play with ...Nd4 in response.

**8...h5 9.O-O Bg7 10.Bd3!?**

The d5-pawn is taboo due to a certain check on b5.

**10...O-O 11.Be4**

The bishop radiates power in all directions from e4, making it harder for Black to develop with ...Nd7 or ...e6. White will follow up with Na3-c4 or c4 and Nc3 and will eventually limber up to trying to strike against Black's weakened kingside after Ng5 and e6.

## Modern #2

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2!?**

We stick with this seemingly innocuous move, but once again with no intention of playing quietly, Classical Pirc style.

If you prefer, the immediate 4.h4!? is also very much an option, if one less likely to surprise a Modern player, especially at fast time limits.

4.Be2 has been over 90% less common than the popular 4. Be3 here, so should surprise. With 4. Be2 we once again most certainly do not renounce an early advance of Harry and are also being quite pragmatic. By far Black's most popular choice here is 4...Nf6 when we're suddenly back into the Pirc and 5.h4 waters.

**4...c6**

is, as we've seen, quite a common move in these Pirc/ Modern positions, but here it does nothing to dissuade our favourite advance:

**5.h4!?**

5.f4 looking to get in a quick e4-e5 is also quite tempting against the slightly slow 4...c6. Now 5...Nf6 6.h4 would take us back into Line A3 of our Pirc coverage, but Black may instead seek counterplay or block our favorite h4-h5 advance:<level start="4...c6"/>

**5...Qb6!?**

is a bit risky, exposing the queen to potential attack after Be3 or a4-a5, but does strike straight at d4 when White isn't in a good position to gambit

**6.Nf3 Bg4**

6...Nf6 is yet to be tried here, but would prevent h4-h5. As such White should look to seize space elsewhere: 7.a4!? 7...a5 8.e5. Now if the knight moves White will get in h4-h5, so an exchange is likely: 8...dxe5 9.Nxe5. White is now ready to go h4-h5 and Black probably shouldn't block: 9...h5?! 10.Bc4 e6 11.O-O.

This feels like a small, but pleasant edge for White. Re1 and Bg5 may follow, with another idea to note that of Ra3, not only facilitating Rb3 or Bg5 without dropping the b-pawn, but hoping for a timely rook swing to g3 with Black potentially vulnerable to a piece sacrifice on g6.

**7.Bc4!?**

White sacrifices a tempo with the bishop, but threatens Bxf7+ and intends aggressive central play:

**7...e6**

Of course, 7...Bxd4?? 8.Qxd4

and 7...Nd7? 8.Bxf7+! Kxf7 9.Ng5+ Ke8 10.Qxg4 Bxd4 11.O-O are somewhat inadvisable for Black.

**8.Bb3 Bxf3**

Otherwise, White would simply go 9.Be3.

**9.Qxf3 Qxd4 10.h5**

Good defence. Black otherwise finds his queen and/or d6 quickly becoming a target:

**10...Qf6 11.Qg3 Qe7? 12.Bf4**

forces further weaknesses

**12...e5 13.Bg5 Bf6 14.hxg6 fxg6 15.Be3**

when the bishop on b3 is a monster and

**15...Nd7 16.O-O-O**

followed by Rd3 keeps Black rather bottled up

## Other Fianchettoes #1

**1.e4**

We've already seen Black fianchetto in both the Pirc and Modern, but he can also do so on the queenside, as we'll now see: D1: 1...b6

D2: 1...a6 The former, Owen's Defence, is, of course, a conventional fianchetto; the latter, the St. George, intends an extended fianchetto with ...b5.

Before we come on to those queenside paths, there is another extended fianchetto we should briefly address

**1...g5?!**

The reversed Grob or Borg Defence. Black defies conventional opening principles and aims to shock White from the word go. We should be neither surprised nor despondent for there are now a number of aggressive counters to choose from.

Note too that 1...h6 2.d4 g5 is but another route in.

**2.d4**

Naturally White seizes the space on offer while laying immediate siege to the rather overextended looking black kingside.

**2...g4?!**

has been tried on a number of occasions by the Borg's greatest modern-day practitioner, the Ukrainian FM Orest Vovk. Black intends 3.Qxg4 d5, so White should simply ignore the g-pawn and develop:

**3.Nc3 Bg7**

Now there's absolutely nothing wrong with a great many moves, including 4.Be3, but it's certainly possible to view the pawn on g4 as a hook to be exploited:

**4.h3!**

Already White is able to open the h-file and seize the initiative:

**4...c5 5.Be3**

Shoring up d4 so seems even stronger than 5.dxc5, which would borrow an idea from our Modern coverage.

**5...cxd4 6.Bxd4 Bxd4 7.Qxd4 Nf6 8.e5!**

There's just no reason not to advance so, since Black's king's knight is a major headache for him: 8...Nc6 9.Qf4 this was Tregubov-O.Vovk, Internet (blitz) 2020, where Black retreated to the back rank and 9...Qc7? 10.Nb5 is no improvement.

## Scandinavian #1

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5**

Unsurprisingly there's nothing better than this natural capture and now we will focus our coverage on three main lines:

- E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4

- E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6

- E3: 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 Nxd5 and 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 Bg4.

The development of the king's knight rather than 2.Nc3 may not seem aggressive, but it is likely to prove mildly annoying to black players looking to trot out their favourite line, like the fashionable 2...Qxd5 3.Nc3 Qd6<level start="2.Nc3"/>

We'll even follow up in the 2...Qxd5 lines with a rapid Be2 and O-O. That may not seem exactly aggressive, but once the king is safe White will quickly storm the center with d4 and c4 in many lines. Moreover, Black's critical line 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 sees him castling queenside, an approach which can lead to White launching a direct attack at quite an early stage.

**2...Qxd5**

Black's most popular move by a ratio of about two to one.

**3.Nf3**

Kingside development first is White's mantra and note that the great Scandinavian authority and Chessable legend John Bartholomew described 3.Nf3 as 'underrated'. Now Black almost always goes 3...Bg4 or 3...Nf6, but we should also check whether he might expand in the center straight away.

**3...Nc6**

can also be met by 4.Nc3 followed by Bb5 and/or d4, although here you may too prefer the outwardly more modest

**4.Be2!?**

when Black usually transposes to the main line with 4...Bg4, that you can find in the main course. Instead, 4...Nf6 will be seen in another chapter in the main course and neither is the central advance to be feared by White:

**4...e5 5.O-O**

Housing the king, refusing to fear ...e4 and intending to hit back with Nc3 and/or d4:

**5...Nf6 6.Nc3 Qa5 7.d4!**

Only one king is safe here and it's not the one on e8. White may go d5, but his immediate threat is to take twice on e5 and go Re1, which all just leaves Black unable to equalize.

**7...exd4 8.Nxd4 Nxd4 9.Qxd4**

The structure may be symmetrical, but development will count. White threatens Nb5 and Bd2, as well as Re1, and even racing his king to safety won't see Black equalize:

9...Be7 10.Nb5 O-O 11.Bf4 Black must now drop a piece back to the first rank to defend c7, leaving White able to begin to expand on the queenside with c4 or even begin to eye the kingside after Bd3, with a definite edge.

## Scandinavian #2

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4**

Black's most active and critical choice.

**4.Be2**

Breaking the pin and also side-stepping any checks on the e-file. White prioritises kingside development before striking back in the center and fighting for the initiative.

**4...e5?**

is also not to be feared, since White's king is safe and he will hit back with Nc3 and d4:

**5.Nc3 Qa5 6.O-O**

Threatening Nxe5.

**6...Nc6**

6...Bxf3?! 7.Bxf3 c6 8.d4 blew open lines before Black was ready in Van Leeuwen-Dunwoody, correspondence 2003.

**7.Re1!?**

This may be even stronger than 7.Nxe5 Bxe2 8.Nxc6 Bxd1 9.Nxa5 Bxc2 10.Nxb7. White reinforced the threat of Nxe5 and there just doesn't seem to be a good move for Black

**7...O-O-O 8.Nxe5 Bxe2 9.Qxe2**

White is just a clear pawn to the good, since Black cannot pin

**9...Re8?? 10.Qg4+**

It's already game over with Nxc6 or Nxf7 set to wreak absolute havoc.

## Scandinavian #3

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6**

Natural development from Black and by far his main approach along with the 3...Bg4 in the main course.

**4.Be2!?**

Outwardly modest development, but an appealing choice. White holds back on d4 to first get his king to safety, hoping that a delayed d4 will carry more force, such as if it counterattacks against a black pawn on e5.

The pawn may even land up on d3, while options are very much kept open too on the c-file: all of Nc3, c4 and c3 may be seen depending on what set-up Black opts for.

**4...Bg4**

This no longer pins, of course, but has been Black's most popular choice.

4...c6 5.O-O is very likely to transpose to our ...Bf5 approach, such as with 5...Bf5 6.d4 e6 7.c4 and we're back in the main line there.

**5.O-O**

Sticking to our general policy of: kingside first. Here White can also consider 5.h3!? Bxf3 6.Bxf3 following by meeting a check with offering a queen exchange and relying on the bishop-pair.

**5...c6**

is another possible move order and very likely to transpose into our main line (5...e6). White should again kick the bishop then expand in the centre with d4 and c4:

**6.h3**

Black usually retains the bishop-pair.

**6...Bxf3 7.Bxf3 Qd6 8.d4**

is quite pleasant for White followed by c4 and Nc3. Here another good set-up was revealed by Maxime Vachier-Lagrave:

**8...e6 9.Na3!? Be7 10.Nc4 Qd8 11.Bf4**

White's bishop on f3 makes it difficult for Black to get ...c5 and he never managed to break free in Vachier Lagrave-Neiksans, Warsaw (blitz) 2010:

11...O-O 12.c3 Nbd7 13.a4! Nb6 14.Ne5 Nbd7 15.Nd3! which kept pieces on and so left Black rather cramped.

## Black Lion #1

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 e5**

A solid response from Black, angling to take play into the Hanham variation of the Philidor after 4.Nf3 Nbd7. Following 5.Bc4 Be7 6.O-O Black can simply play 6...O-O or aim for more with early aggressive plan on the kingside, as covered in Simon's popular course on the Black Lion.

**4.dxe5**

This might not seem aggressive, but just as in our Pirc coverage, we should not mind an early queen exchange to displace Black's king and create a large central target.

Such an approach may also frustrate Black Lion players and psychological factors are also at play, as we'll soon see. If you really don't like the idea of such an exchange, while we can't especially recommend 4.f4 exd4 5.Qxd4 Nc6 6.Bb5 for White, but Black is fine after 6...Be7,

there is 4.Nf3 Nbd7 and then, as well as 5.Bc4, Shirov's 5.g4!?.

**4...dxe5 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8**

Now White usually goes 6.Bg5 or 6.Bc4 when a protracted manoeuvring struggle, very slightly in White's favour, usually ensures. However, just because White has traded queens at any early stage doesn't mean that he can't continue aggressively.

**6.f4!?**

This direct and fairly rare central assault may come as a surprise to an opponent looking forward to gradually untangling their pieces. Objectively, Black should be OK after it, but, especially if caught out, it's easy for him to lose his way.

Moreover, Anish Giri has played this way as White and there surely can't be anything wrong with making White's main and most aggressive pawn break in the position as quickly as possible.

**6...Bb4!?**

By quite some margin Black's most popular response, countering against e4, and it was also recommended by Erik Zude and JÃ¶rg Hickl in their 'Play 1...d6 Against Everything' course, but White should welcome the resulting unbalanced middlegame.

**7.Bd3**

Sensibly overprotecting e4. 7.fxe5?! Nxe4 is definitely not encouraged .

And Black should now be OK after 7.Bd2 exf4! 8.O-O-O Nbd7.

**7...Nbd7**

This natural development and an exchange on f4 have been Black's most popular continuations, but there doesn't yet appear to be a clear consensus as to how he should handle this relatively uncharted position.

**8.Nf3**

Increasing the central pressure and even allowing White to go short should he so desire.

**8...c6?**

is the other main move to have been tried in practice, but is flawed:

**9.fxe5 Ng4 10.Bg5+!**

This is the issue for Black, not 10.Bf4 Re8 when he does regain his pawn.

**10...Be7 11.Bf4**

11...f6!? What else to try with h3 threatened?

12.exf6 Bxf6 13.h3 Nge5 14.O-O-O White had all his usual pressure and was simply a pawn to the good in Neverov-Baljiev, Gyor 1997. Rhf1 and Nd4 was set to follow or even h4 and Ng5.

## Black Lion #2

**1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 e5 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8 6.f4!? Bb4!? 7.Bd3 Nc6**

also covers e5 when White tends to renew the pressure:

**8.Nf3**

A decent case can also be made for 8.f5!?, as we saw in the notes to Turner-Fernandez back in the introductory games.

**8...Bg4 9.O-O**

A pretty good case can also be made for 9.fxe5!? Nd7 10.Bf4 followed by going long.<level/>

9...Bc5+?! 10.Kh1 Bxf3 11.gxf3 Nh5? This saw Black trying to take over on the dark squares in Giri-Yudin, World Blitz Championship, St. Petersburg 2018, but White was able to retain all his dynamism and the bishop-pair with a simple retreat 12.fxe5 Nxe5 13.Be2! Nc6 14.f4 Suddenly Black was being driven backwards in disarray with his knight and king somewhat misplaced, especially with White easily able to go Bd2 and Rad1 or e5 and Ne4.

9...Re8

was still a better option when White might simply go 10.fxe5, angling for exchanges and Bf4,

or 10.h3!? Bxf3 11.gxf3 and if 11...Nh5!? 12.Nd5!? Bd6 13.f5 with a complex struggle ahead, if one where Black's king might not be entirely happily placed, especially with White able to go Rd1 and Bc4, leaving his queenside pieces at home for a couple more moves; the dark-squared bishop may emerge on e3, g5 or even f4.
