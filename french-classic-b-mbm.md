This series provides an ideal platform to study chess openings. By continually challenging the reader to answer probing questions throughout the book, the Move by Move format greatly encourages the learning and practising of vital skills just as much as the traditional assimilation of opening knowledge. Carefully selected questions and answers are designed to keep you actively involved and allow you to monitor your progress as you learn. This is an excellent way to study any chess opening and at the same time improve your general chess skills and knowledge.

In this book, International Master Cyrus Lakdawala invites you to join him in studying the French Defence, Classical Variation, which is a popular choice among chess players of all levels. Lakdawala examines in detail the important and commonly played lines, including the Steinitz, McCutcheon and Burn Variations. Using illustrative games and drawing on his own experience with the opening, he explains the main positional and tactical ideas for both sides, provides answers to all the key questions and tells you everything you need to know about successfully playing the Classical French.

Cyrus Lakdawala is an International Master, a former National Open and American Open Champion, and a six-time State Champion. He has been teaching chess for over 30 years, and coaches some of the top junior players in the U.S.

Move by Move is a series of opening books which uses a question-and-answer format. One of our main aims of the series is to replicate - as much as possible - lessons between chess teachers and students. --- All the way through, readers will be challenged to answer searching questions and to complete exercises, to test their skills in chess openings and indeed in other key aspects of the game. It's our firm belief that practising your skills like this is an excellent way to study chess openings, and to study chess in general.

Many thanks go to all those who have been kind enough to offer inspiration, advice and assistance in the creation of Move by Move. We're really excited by this series and hope that readers will share our enthusiasm.

The French Classical is acquired after Black applies extra pressure to the white centre with 3...Nf6 after 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6<skip start="3...Nf6"/>

### (4)Why Play the French?   --   ? ? ????   \* (Cyrus Lakdawala)

If the human race is the by-product of Darwinian selection, where only the fittest of the species survive, then why is it that on the chess board - a Darwinian dystopia if there ever was one, defensive players win just as often or more than belligerent attackers? My theory is that defensive players - and we French players perfectly fit this category, are better suited to survive than our aggressively inclined counterparts, who have a nasty way of gambling away their lives by chasing some folly. Children want a 100% share and tend to pick fights with other children over trivial matters. As adults, having grown wiser (and perhaps also more devious!), we learn to pick our fights. Sometimes our self-interest lies in the surrender of a minor skirmish, in order to later win the war. The Classical French embraces this philosophy. From the start, we cede White space and by default, attacking chances, all in order to counterattack later. --- Some players stick to one opening scheme their entire chess lives, meeting 1.e4

with Pirc, Modern Defence, Scandinavian, Alekhine's Defence, Caro-Kann, Sicilian, or

**1.e4 e5**

. I'm the opposite as my ADHD-infected brain tends to amble to anything and everything in the opening. In fact, I'm hard pressed to come up with an opening, however esoteric, which I haven't played. But if you ask me what my favourite opening is, I faithfully answer: The French Defence (except I spell the word defense with an 's'!). I have yet to discover another strategically rich opening which invariably flares into irrational tactics later on, the way the French does. If understanding the French is a science, then it is a dark science. The panoramic scope of potential structures is staggering and that is what fascinates me the most about the opening. Whenever I play the French, I get that restful feeling of being completely at home. The French has been a key player in my opening repertoire since the early 70's and I never tire of its adventures or even its misadventures. It takes a coldblooded - I would go as far as to call it reptilian - spirit to navigate and survive the violent corridors of the Classical (or any other!) French Defence, an opening of docile outer appearances but great inner turmoil, always on the verge of calamity. After playing the French for a while, it may appear to you that our opening is nothing more than a series of crises for Black, and you would be correct in your assumption. But there is also great reward, should we happen to survive our ordeal, since the opening contains within its core a hidden, coiled spring mechanism. We first get pushed back and then later emerge bullying our previous bullier.

The Dark Square question: Why play Classical over the Winawer?: The Winawer ( 1...e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 ) is currently more popular than the Classical. However, if you look at the choice of top GMs, they tend to lean toward the Classical. The reason may be it is slightly more strategically sound than Winawer, since Black retains greater control over the dark squares. Back in the 80's, I asked my friend IM Doug Root why he played Classical French rather than the Winawer. He answered: "I like my dark squares!" In the Winawer - which has always been my main French and Classical my secondary - Black, in the main lines plays ...Bb4 and usually later ... Bxc3+, handing White the bishop pair and control over the dark squares to inflict damage to the structure. In the Classical, we don't get the better structure, but we do hang on to our precious dark-squared bishop - and with it, our dark squares.

Cramped Quarters: In the Classical French, we willingly hand White an early space advantage as soon as e5 is played. This lack of space can be chaffing and it's easy to experience suffocating, submerged feelings, not knowing which direction is up - the place of life-giving air. If we allow the asphyxiation to continue without fighting back with undermining freeing ideas like ...c5 and ...f6, we risk getting squeezed and passing bluely, from this life to the next. It feels as if the yin/yang ratio is askew and we often wish our side could use a little more yang in the formula. But realize this: Our yang is there. It simply arrives late. The nature of the French is to hand White an early (and often temporary) initiative. Ours arrives later, often in the form of withering counterattacks. Those who play French begin to sense something formidable behind the opening's seemingly passive exterior. --- The French is a species of opening which has a nasty habit of upending those who don't know their theory. The Classical French is one of those libraryish openings we just can't wing through in an abstract or absent manner. Black's demeanour manifests outwardly of meek servility, all the while inwardly of a conspirator plotting revenge. Sometimes we arrive in positions we just can't wrestle our way out of. The best course of action is to remain loose and allow White's fearful initiative wave to pass over us and only then counterattack. Our opening is not for those whose haughty spirit rankles and chafes at the first sign of an opponent's initiative. --- The staggering enormity and scope of the lines we must master is intimidating. It's critical we glean understanding of the inner workings of each opening line, not just memorizing it, like a parrot, who can repeat, yet lacks the ability to understand what she is saying. Each chapter contains its separate joys and trials. I once read that the monk Gregor Mendel, the father of modern genetics flunked his teaching certificate examination in both geology and zoology! Moral: We all sometimes forget our lines! So let's not lose heart if we sometimes omit a key move or idea and get upended in a theoretical duel. --- Let's take a look at our Classical French battlegrounds (see the following games).

### (5)Main line Classical   --   ? ? ????   \* (Cyrus Lakdawala)

FEN: r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/2n1p3/2bpP3/3N1P2/2N1B3/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 1

The Classical Main line is a variation imbibed with the baffling suspense of a good mystery novel and the frantic urgency of a thriller, especially since opposite wings castling steps up the intrigue.

I like Black's chances, with our open c-file, the possibility of attacking with ...a6 and later ...b5, and also the fact that we can meet White's coming attack with a timely ...f6 or ...f5 counter.

### (6)The Shirov-Anand Line   --   ? ? ????   \* (Cyrus Lakdawala)

FEN: r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P1P2/2P5/PP2N1PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1

Chapter Two has the disorienting quality of being lost in an unfamiliar city.

We reach a position more closely associated with the f4 lines of Tarrasch, rather than Classical.

### (7)The 8...Qb6 Poisoned Pawn Line   --   ? ? ????   \* (Cyrus Lakdawala)

"If I Swallow Anything Evil, Put Your Finger Down My Throat..."

In chaotic positions, it sometimes appears to us as if the correlation of cause and effect breaks down. Of course this is an illusion, bred by our own ignorance. The 8...Qb6!? Poisoned Pawn Line appears to strain the fulcrum of common sense, until it snaps. The cause of every effect still remains, even when we can't see it. I fear Paul Morphy, if he were alive today, would vomit upon viewing Black's decision to go pawn-hunting, violating the ABC's of opening principle in the most flagrant manner possible. A warning: Your losses in this line could be unpleasantly memorable. The choice of opening lines yields clues to the motivations of their devotees. The Poisoned Pawn Line tells us the following: People who play this line may harbour the criminal gene and are willing to take excessive risks to steal a mere pawn. I freely admit that Black's last move, 8...Qb6, fishing for b2, is one of outlandish design. --- Ambition has its costs and in the Poisoned Pawn Line, we are willing to pay the price. However, lately in high-level games, top-ten-ranked GMs are experiencing a devil of a time proving even an edge for White. So what first began in the 1980s as a sleazy side line, designed to waylay unsuspecting victims, may now have gone legit, championed by no less than the likes of GM Hikaru Nakamura, who uses it as a drawing weapon! A bearer of stunning news loves to evoke shock and terror in his or her audience, so brace yourself when I declare to you: Black's pawn grab is sound (at least at the time of this writing). Black's queen is the secretly genius jester in a court of unaware fools. She continues to play dumb, all the while, laughing inwardly, as she sneaks away with a pawn.<skip/>

White's once dominant centre is slowly chipped away from the flanks, with ...c5 and eventually ...f6.

The game revolves around White's ability to control the e5-square.

### (9)Burn variation 6...gxf6   --   ? ? ????   \* (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**6.--**<fen value="rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pB2/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6"/>

In the Burn variation 6...gxf6

, we grab the bishop pair and agree to a disruption of our pawn centre. We concentrate on Morozevich's specialty of the ...a6 and ...b5 plan, with rich, unbalanced play.<fenend/>

### (10)The McCutcheon   --   ? ? ????   \* (Cyrus Lakdawala)

Our next three positions represent some of our most difficult strategic challenges in the book. These are positions conducive to experimentation and we simply go where the road takes us! 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.e5 h6:

6.Bd2 Bxc3 7.bxc3 Ne4 8.Qg4

6.Be3 Ne4 7.Qg4

6.Bc1 Ne4 7.Qg4 .

### (11)The History of the French   --   ? ? ????   \* (Cyrus Lakdawala)

Our opening took its birth in 1834, in a correspondence match between London and Paris, when the French player, Chamouillet, influenced his teammates to respond to

**1.e4**

with the introverted and baffling

**1...e6!**

. According to my database, the French today is Black's third most popular response to 1 e4, behind the Sicilian and 1...e5. Here is a startlingly modern-looking early encounter (see the following game).

### (12)Schallopp, E.   --   Paulsen, L. Leipzig  1877   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6**

As you can see, the Classical French has been around for a long time.

**4.e5**

The fifth rank - the opponent's territory - is that violation of the invisible barrier of the neutral zone, which we all desire to cross in the opening.

We will spend a good chunk of the book looking at 4.Bg5 .

**4...Nfd7 5.Nce2**

The Shirov-Anand Line, which we will cover in Chapter 2. White deliberately clogs development and also moves the same piece twice in the opening - both violations - to back up his centre with c3.

**5...c5 6.c3**

All future ...cxd4 lines will be met with cxd4, rather than a piece recapture on d4.

**6...Nc6 7.f4 Qb6 8.Nf3 f6 9.a3 Be7**

Amazing. This is the cutting-edge position we reach in Anand-Shirov from Chapter 2, except this game was played well over a century before that one. Louis Paulsen was a century ahead of most of his rivals in his opening choices, since in those days nearly everyone responded to 1 e4 classically, with 1...e5.

**10.Ng3!?**

If a GM played this move today, I would hand it a '?!' mark, but it's easy to forget that in those days, there were no opening books and no databases with easy-to-pull-up stats. White can't unravel so easily without a price levied upon his centre.

Today, 10.b4

and 10.h4 are White's two main lines.

**10...O-O**

QUESTION: If 10.Ng3?! is dubious as you claim, how can Black exploit it?

ANSWER: This way: 10...fxe5! 11.dxe5 ( 11.fxe5 cxd4 12.cxd4 O-O 13.Bd3 transposes to the game ) 11...c4! ...Nc5 is in the air and Black already stands better, since b2 and b3 provide Black with juicy targets, "Albitexm"-"Badbishop1", Internet 2007.

**11.Bd3 cxd4 12.cxd4 fxe5 13.fxe5?**

EXERCISE (combination alert/planning): White's dream of endless peace and plenty in the realm is about to be shattered by a bout of war, pestilence and hunger. White's last move allows Black a very promising plan, which today, is a standard idea in many French lines. What is it?

As kids, we were all told to capture toward the centre. In this case, White was better off violating the principle with 13.dxe5 Nc5 14.Bc2 a5 15.Be3!? ( White was probably better off with the calmer 15.Rb1 a4 16.Be3 Qa5+ 17.Kf2 ) 15...Qxb2 16.O-O , V.Bologan-O.Danielian, Jurmala 1991. I don't believe in White's full compensation for the pawn.

**13...Rxf3!**

ANSWER: The undermining exchange sac decimates White's once proud pawn centre. --- The sound of a cannon salvo rouses White from his nap, with a start. The ambitious rook seeks to alter and upgrade the designation of his job description, from "Knight of the Realm" to 'Universal Overlord'. Of course the temptation to sac is overwhelming (especially when it is absolutely sound, as in this case!), like a pizza delivery driver who didn't get a chance to eat lunch, and who gazes lovingly at the pizza he must hand over to an undeserving stranger. We don't always require gigabytes of information to make a decision. Sometimes the eye sees and we simply feel the correct answer, rather than compute it. I'm certain Paulsen didn't need to work out all the lines of this very promising exchange sac (it almost isn't a sac, since he gets so much for it!).

**14.Qxf3?!**

Now White's centre hangs.

He had to try 14.gxf3 Nxd4 15.f4 Nb3 16.Rb1 Nxc1 17.Qxc1 Nc5 18.Bc2 Bd7 ( 18...Nb3 19.Bxb3 Qxb3 also looks quite promising for Black, who dominates the light squares ) 19.Qe3 Bb5 20.Rd1 ( 20.b4? is met with 20...Nd3+ 21.Kd2 Nxf4! 22.Qxf4 Rf8 when White must return the piece ) 20...Rc8 when Black stands clearly better. For the exchange, he gets a pawn, the bishop pair, potential pawn targets and a shaky white king, D.Velimirovic-D.Antic, Herceg Novi 2001.

**14...Qxd4 15.Ne2 Qh4+!**

This disruption is much stronger than 15...Qxe5 16.O-O .

**16.g3**

16.Qg3 Ndxe5 17.Bc2 b6 18.O-O Bc5+ 19.Kh1 Qxg3 20.Nxg3 Ba6 21.Rf4 Rc8 also leaves White uncoordinated, grossly behind in development and busted.

**16...Ndxe5 17.Qe3**

17.gxh4 Nxf3+ 18.Kf2 Nxh4 is a hopeless ending for White, since three pawns and the initiative are way too much for an mere exchange.

**17...Nxd3+**

Add the bishop pair to Black's already impressive strategic portfolio.

**18.Qxd3 Qf6**

QUESTION: Why did Black walk into an obvious tempo loss? --- ANSWER: Black loses a tempo, no matter where he moves.

If: 18...Ne5 19.Qe3 Qf6 20.Rf1 Nc4 21.Qd3 , Black loses a tempo with his queen.

Most promising is: 18...Qh5! 19.Nf4 Qe5+ 20.Qe3 Qxe3+ 21.Bxe3 d4 22.Bd2 e5 23.Nd5 Bd6 , Black's two central passers and bishop pair give him a strategically won game.

**19.Rf1 Qe5 20.Bd2! Bd7!**

QUESTION: Why not grab another one on b2? --- ANSWER: Too greedy.

Black falls behind in development and pays a price after 20...Qxb2?! 21.Bc3 Qb3 ( Black is unexpectedly busted after 21...Qb6?? 22.Qf3! ) 22.Nd4 Qb6 23.Nxc6 Qxc6 ( 23...bxc6? 24.Qf3! gets White back in the game ) 24.Qd4 e5! 25.Qxe5 Bf6 26.Rxf6 Qxf6 27.Qxf6 gxf6 28.Bxf6 and White should hold the game a pawn down.

**21.Bc3 Qd6 22.O-O-O**

EXERCISE (planning): Nothing is as arduous as being forced to perform an unpleasant task. Castling long represents more of a brief reprieve, rather than real freedom for White. Find one potent yet thematic French idea and White's king experiences serious difficulties. --- ANSWER: Transfer the bad bishop to the h7-b1 diagonal. Throughout the book, please prepare yourself for my multiple torrential diatribes defending the French bad bishop, an unjustly maligned piece.

**22...Be8!**

The bishop approaches his fancied diagonal with the silent yet deadly promise of destruction-to-come of a torpedo. The weakness of the light squares is the underlying reality through which the majority of White's coming troubles arise.

**23.h4**

QUESTION: If ...Bg6 is so powerful, then why not simply halt it with 23.Nf4 since Black will not dare to play the weakening ...g5? --- ANSWER: Black dares when goaded. 23...g5! ( the simple 23...Bf7! also looks quite promising for Black. 24.h4 Rd8 and ...d4 is coming ) 24.Ne2 ( White's best may be to enter a difficult ending with 24.Nxe6 Qxe6 25.Rfe1 Qd7 26.Qxd5+ Qxd5 27.Rxd5 ) 24...Bg6 25.Qb5 Rc8 is hopeless for White's king, who is caught in a deadly crossfire.

**23...Rc8**

One obvious problem for White is the fact that he is unable to tuck his king away with Kb1-a1.

**24.Nd4 Bg6**

The normally reserved bad bishop's reticence melts away and now nobody can get him to shut up. Now, the weakness of White's light squares spreads like gangrene up an infected limb.

**25.Qe3 e5**

Black can play this move due to the pin on the c-file.

**26.Nxc6**

26.Nf5 Qe6 27.Nxe7+ Nxe7 is completely hopeless for White, who bleeds on the light squares.

**26...Rxc6 27.Qxa7**

Nothing is as unnerving to a burglar as the cocking sound of a homeowner's gun.

**27...d4**

There is no expiration date on Black's initiative. Paulsen sinks a grappling hook to the c3-bishop. Meanwhile, White's king has the distinct appearance of a man who dearly wishes to be elsewhere - wherever 'elsewhere' is.

**28.Qxb7**

The obese queen having eaten her fill and then some (with possible indigestion), wears a mysterious Mona Lisa smile. Swallowing the food isn't enough. We must also digest what we consume. White's queen expects to be lavishly supported financially, in a style to which she has become accustomed. These trinkets picked up on a7 and b7 did not accord White an iota of good.

**28...Qe6**

Caissa's blessings have been exhausted and it's no use to pray for more. White can resign.

**29.a4**

Hey, I said "Caissa's blessings have been exhausted and..." oh, never mind, I forgot: Everyone played on until mate in the 1800s, since their code of honour regarded resignation as some kind of character flaw.

**29...dxc3 30.b4**

Houdini's evaluation: -11.89!.

**30...h5**

Ending all back rank vulgarities.

30...Qb3?? walks into mate after 31.Qa8+ . When we pull off a cheapo in a losing position, it's as if some hidden and powerful deity grants us grace by pardoning all our past sins, with a casual wave of a hand.

**31.Qd7 Bxb4 32.Qxe6+ Rxe6 33.Rd8+ Kh7 34.a5**

It's easy to predict the result when the royal court fop whips out his thin rapier, while his muscle bound knight-of-the-realm opponent slowly unsheathes a two-handed broadsword by its hilt.

**34...Ba3+**

The pious bishop, unused to the white king's coarse language and vile oaths, shields his ears with hands to avoid further unspiritual taint.

There was nothing wrong with the greedier 34...Bxa5 .

**35.Kd1 c2+ 36.Kd2 c1=Q+**

The c1-square proves to be a major centre of commerce. Black could have been more patient in the payoff part of the process.

36...Rc6 37.Rc1 Bxc1+ 38.Kxc1 Rf6 is also a trivial win.

**37.Rxc1 Bxc1+ 38.Kxc1 e4 39.Ra8 e3 40.a6**

A war council of the nation's brightest minds agrees that a queening race is White's sure-fire path to victory. The transcripts: "It would be the wisest course of action to engage Black in a queening race," councils White's not-so-bright king, who many believe was dropped on his head when he was a baby. "Yes, our swift and faithful a-pawn will surely reach promotion before Black's slowpoke e-pawn," chime in White's yes-men rooks. "Agreed. Victory is within sight with this cunning plan," adds White's queen, whose multiple "honorary" PhDs do not fool anyone.

**40...e2 41.Kd2!?**

Boy, White's last move is the epitome of a feeble protest. The white king believes that people regard his silent nature as one of a profoundly deep thinker, while most attribute his silence to imbecility. One gets the feeling that people had a lot of time on their hands in the year 1877. I'm not sure this move is as effective as Schallopp originally believed. We establish the following crucial facts: 1. Black queens by force. --- 2. By queening, Black delivers checkmate. --- 3. White seems to be doing his best at ignoring numbers 1 and 2.

**41...e1=Q#!**

Mate! --- "I am God's turnspit, little man; you are the roasting pig, with apple in mouth," declares the newly coronated queen, self-importantly. --- SUMMARY: It's time to enter the kill-or-be-killed world of the Classical French.

### (13)1: Classical Steinitz   --   Main Line ? ????   \* (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**8...--**<fen value="r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/2n1p3/2bpP3/3N1P2/2N1B3/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8"/>

We begin the book with a heavily contested position at the highest levels. --- We soon reach an opposite wing attacking position: 9.Qd2 O-O 10.O-O-O a6 11.h4

The areas of agreement between the two parties evaporate and war is imminent. Now comes the time for us to flaunt our attacking prowess. Both parties plan to swoop onto the other's king, like homing pigeons. One wrong move by either side may lead to treacherous conditions escalating at alarming rates, and the spot where our king (or, hopefully, our opponent's king!) stood, may turn into a flaming crater. Each time we score a victory in such a line, our king takes the deep breath of a man who, through sheer luck, avoided certain death that day. --- Key points to keep in mind in this chapter: White's plans: 1. White may play to soften our kingside dark squares and weaken our back rank with h5 and h6. --- 2. White may play for an f5 break. The difficulty with implementing this plan is the moment White plays f5, the e5-pawn becomes a chronic weakness. --- 3. White may play h4 and Rh3, which not only prepares a future Rg3, but also helps defend White's king laterally. --- 4. White may opt for the attacking plan Qf2, intending Bd3 and eventually Qh4, taking direct aim at h7. --- Black's position also comes well-armed for combat.

Our plans: 1. Black can play ...Bxd4, followed by ...b5, ...b4, ...a5 and ...Ba6, which begins a pawn storm against White's king and activates our dormant "bad" c8-bishop, which as we see in this chapter, really isn't as bad as previously advertised. --- 2. After we achieve step one, we load up major pieces down the open c-file, tying White down to defence of c2. We often do this in conjunction with ...a4 and ...b3, or ...a4 and ...a3, which weakens c3 and the dark squares around White's king. --- 3. We must develop a feel for when to play the counter...f6, since playing ...f6 keeps our king safer and generates play down the f-file, and when to hold back on the move as it also weakens e6 and e5.<fenend/>

### (14)Najer, E.   --   Rychagov, A. 1: Russian Championships, Krasnoyarsk  2007   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6**

Here we are, the Classical French, the Winawer's twin brother. --- QUESTION: What are the main characteristics which differentiate Winawer from Classical? --- ANSWER: 1. The most important difference is that in Winawer, Black usually hands over his or her all-important dark-squared bishop with ...Bb4 and later ...Bxc3+, which damages White's structure but also weakens Black on the dark squares. The Classical is less extreme. We usually hang on to our dark-squared bishop but don't inflict structural damage. --- 2. Even so, the positions are no less violent than Winawer, since in Classical, we often end up with opposite wings attack, with White going queenside and us castling kingside. (In the Winawer Poisoned Pawn Line, Black also frequently castles long and White's king usually stays in the centre) --- 3. IM Byron Jacobs writes in 'Starting Out: The French': "It is a curious thing but the Classical has always been less popular among amateur players than the Winawer, even though the Classical is currently more popular than the Winawer at elite level!" Well, maybe the players at the top know something we don't. I employed Winawer as my main French for over 30 years. The Classical was utilized only as a second string, backup surprise weapon. Having researched for this book, I am beginning to wish I played Classical more often, since I endured a lot of dark-square suffering in Winawers over the decades!

**4.e5**

We cover this move, The Modern Classical lines, in the first four chapters of the book.

Then later we tackle 4.Bg5 dxe4 - The Burn Variation. ( and 4...Bb4 - The McCutcheon. )

**4...Nfd7**

The main move. --- QUESTION: The d7-knight looks out of place and promises to turn into a problem piece, correct? --- ANSWER: Very true, our d7-knight tends to gum up development. Yet there may be a promising future for the knight: 1. After ...c5 and ...cxd4, our knight may head for c5, where it eyes important squares like a4, b3, d3 and e4. --- 2. After ...c5, ...cxd4, ...a6 and ...b5, we can transfer our knight to b6 where it overlooks attacking squares a4 and c4. --- 3. After ...c5, ...cxd4 and ...f6, we undermine White's control over e5. If White plays exf6 we may respond with ...Nxf6, when the knight returns to polite society. --- QUESTION: I don't mean to be a pessimist, but how exactly are we going to develop our other problem piece: the not-so-pretty c8-bishop? --- ANSWER: For now the c8-bishop finds its freedom of movement circumscribed within tight boundaries, but not forever. Not to worry. Believe it or not, this "bad" c8-bishop nearly always finds employment elsewhere, with the following choice of plans: 1. Black plays ...a6,...b5 and then later ...b4 and ...a5. This allows for ...Ba6, when we swap off our theoretically bad bishop for White's powerful f1-counterpart. --- 2. Black plays a future ...f6. After exf6 and ...Nxf6, we blast our way out by forcing ...e5 later on. --- 3. In Plan #2, our bad bishop embraces virtue by weaving its way out with ...Bd7, ...Be8 and usually ...Bg6, where it takes aim at White's king and c2, while keeping our own king more secure.

We won't be covering oddball lines like 4...Ne4

or 4...Ng8 .

**5.f4**

White logically clamps down the e5-square and seizes kingside space, hoping to translate the advantage into a kingside attack. --- QUESTION: Does Black have to castle kingside, into this attack? --- ANSWER: Pretty much, the answer is yes, since we attempt a corresponding attack on the other side of the board with ...c5, ...cxd4, ...a6 and ...b5.

In the coming chapters, we cover 5.Nce2

and 5.Nf3 .

**5...c5**

Principle: Chip away at an opponent's pawn chain at its base, which in this case is d4. Now having said this, let's not be afraid of playing a future ...f6 break. The key is to time it correctly. --- QUESTION: But doesn't an ...f6 break hand us a backward e6-pawn? --- ANSWER: Correct but few desirable things in life are free. We do indeed take on a backward e6-pawn. In exchange, we unravel and generate play down the f-file. Even though e6 is admittedly an eyesore, I don't recall a single game where I actually later lost the pawn. The greater danger to us is that White may manage to use e5 as a hole for his or her pieces. Still, from my experience, the damage tends to be more cosmetic than real for Black.

**6.Nf3**

Next chapter we examine 6.Nce2 .

**6...Nc6 7.Be3**

The fight is for control over the magnetic d4-square which tends to pull both sides' pieces toward it.

**7...cxd4**

Due to Everyman's irrational demand that I keep all my books under 1000 pages, we won't have room to cover the alternatives 7...a6

7...Qb6

and 7...Be7 .

**8.Nxd4 Bc5**

The battle for d4 continues.

In Chapter Three, we will look at 8...Qb6!? , the psychotic Poisoned Pawn Line, perfectly suited for those readers with mental health issues, suicidal tendencies, or those who delusionally believe they are protected from all harm by powerful unseen forces, or just those who were born with a larcenous chess gene (for example, your writer) and like the idea of absconding with other people's property, and then successfully evading the law!

**9.Qd2**

White prepares to castle queenside.

QUESTION: What if White isn't interested in opposite wing attacks and decides to calmly castle kingside with 9.Be2 ? --- ANSWER: This plan is too slow for White and allows Black at least equality after 9...Qb6 (pressuring both d4 and b2).

10.Na4 Qa5+ 11.c3 Bxd4! 12.Bxd4 Nxd4 13.Qxd4 b6! and ...Nc5 is in the air, as is ...Ba6. 14.Bd1 was played in K.Aseev-S.Dolmatov, Irkutsk 1986. White's a4-knight continues to dangle and Black has at least equal chances after 14...O-O 15.O-O Nb8! intending ...Nc6 or ...Bd7.

10.Ncb5?! is too loose. After 10...O-O ( 10...a6 11.Nd6+ Bxd6 12.exd6 Qxb2 is also playable and I prefer Black here ) 11.c3 a6 as occurred in A.Dunne-A.Bueno, Internet 2009, too many White units are hanging. If the b5-knight moves, then b2 falls, and if 12.b4 Black has 12...Nxb4 13.cxb4 Bxb4+ 14.Kf2 axb5 when White lacks a good discovery and is down material for no compensation.

**9...O-O**

Bring it on. We are not afraid of opposing wing attacks.

9...Bxd4 10.Bxd4 Nxd4 11.Qxd4 Qb6 12.Qxb6 ( 12.Nb5 is also played here ) 12...Nxb6 was G.Kasparov-E.Bareev, Novgorod 1997. This isn't so bad for Black if we are happy with a draw. But who wants to defend such a drab "+=" ending with Black? As you may have guessed, we won't be covering this line in the book. Let's play for the win!

**10.O-O-O a6**

At some point, we expand with a future ...b5. We don't fear Nxc6?! bxc6 which conveniently opens the b-file for us and also strengthens our centre.

**11.h4**

A clear pronouncement of White's intention - he plays for mate.

Later in the chapter, we examine critical alternatives 11.Qf2

11.Nb3

and 11.Kb1 .

**11...Nxd4**

We initiate this exchange to play ...b5.

Black can also take a chance and cede control over the dark squares to gain time with 11...Bxd4 12.Bxd4 b5 . Watch how quickly White can get into trouble after 13.Rh3 b4 with careless play: ( 14.Na4 Qa5 15.b3 Nxd4 16.Qxd4 Rb8 17.Bd3 Nb6 18.Nxb6 Qxb6 19.Qxb6 Rxb6 looks even despite Black's slightly bad bishop. ) ( 14.Ne2 a5 15.h5 Ba6 , the not-so-bad bishop emerges from his lair. 16.g4 Rc8 17.g5 Qc7 18.Bg1 (White preserves the bishop that Black wasn't really interested in taking!) 18...Ne7 (clearing the c-file and taking advantage of the fresh f5-hole) 19.Nd4?? ( 19.Kb1 Nc5 looks dynamically balanced ) 19...Bxf1 20.Rxf1 Qc4! . The a2-pawn falls, after which White's position collapses, D.Pavasovic-K.Bischoff, Lippstadt 1998. )

**12.Bxd4 b5**

Black increases queenside space and prepares his own attack.

**13.Rh3**

A move with offensive and defensive capabilities.

We will look at 13.h5 in Topalov-Morozevich later in the chapter.

**13...Bb7**

Black attempts to complete development. --- QUESTION: Posting the bishop on b7 doesn't make sense to me when he can play ...b4, ...a5 and ...Ba6. What is the idea? --- ANSWER: The posting on b7 contains a couple of hidden points: 1. If White ever plays Bxc5 Nxc5, then the b7 bishop backs up e4 and prepares ...Ne4. --- 2. When Black later plays ...b4, if White responds with the blockading Na4, then Black can play either ...Bxd4, followed by ...Qa5 and after b3, prepare to go after the a4-knight with ...Bc6.

QUESTION: Can Black play 13...b4 first instead to get the sort of position mooted in point 2? --- ANSWER: Yes, he can. The ...b4, ...a5 and ...Ba6 plan has also been played by top GMs. After 14.Na4 Bxd4 15.Qxd4 , we examine both concepts: ( 15...Qa5 16.b3 Bb7 17.c3 Rfc8 18.Kb2 bxc3+ 19.Rxc3 Rxc3 20.Qxc3 Qd8 (keeping queens to maintain the queenside offensive) 21.g3 Rc8 22.Qe3 Bc6 23.Nc3 a5 24.Bd3 Rb8 25.Ne2 a4 26.Nd4? ( better is 26.Rc1! ) 26...Qb6! , T.Fogarasi-E.Bricard, Paris 1995, gives Black a powerful attack. ) ( 15...a5 16.Bb5 Rb8 ( the autopilot response 16...Ba6?? loses material to 17.Bxd7 Qxd7 18.Nb6 ) 17.Bd3 ( Black stands better (with the theoretically bad bishop!) after 17.Bxd7 Bxd7 18.Nc5 Bb5 Black will simply pile the major pieces on the c-file, with the superior chances ) 17...f6 ( also possible is 17...Qc7 18.h5 Bb7 19.Re3 Bc6 20.Nc5 Nxc5 21.Qxc5 Rfc8 22.f5 Bb5! 23.Qxc7 Rxc7 when Black has equalized, A.Fedorov-V.Akopian, Moscow 2002 ) 18.exf6 Qxf6 19.Qxf6 Rxf6 20.Re3 Rxf4 21.Rxe6 Nf6 22.Rd6 Bg4 with a dynamically balanced ending, F.Langheinrich-A.Shirov, Germany 2003. )

**14.a3!?**

GMs are rarely slaves to precedent. This new move attempts to slow Black's queenside pawn raid but at the cost of providing Black a convenient prying target with a future ...b4. Maybe White would just be better off without the insertion of this preamble.

Let's look at some less compromising moves for White: More natural is 14.h5 b4 15.Na4? Bxd4 16.Qxd4 Qa5 17.b3 Bc6 (this is another example of the anti-Na4 plan we discussed earlier) 18.Nb2 Qxa2 19.Nd3 , T.Thorhallsson-D.Sadvakasov, Mallorca 2004. White fails to generate compensation for the lost pawn after 19...Rab8 20.Kd2 Qa5 21.Ra1 Qb6 22.Qxb6 Rxb6 .

14.Kb1 (so that a2-pawn is guarded) 14...b4 15.Na4 Bxd4 16.Qxd4 Qa5 17.b3 Bc6 18.Nb2 Bb5 19.Bd3 Rac8 ( 19...Rfc8 is also playable, as in S.Kuipers-Vallejo Pons, Germany 2012 ) 20.Bxb5 Qxb5 21.Nd3 a5 22.Rd2 Nc5 23.Nxc5 Rxc5 24.Rf3?! , N.Guliev-S.Kindermann, Germany 2008, and now Black should continue 24...a4 ! with a powerful initiative.

**14...Qe7**

A slightly unusual posting for the queen. Perhaps Rychagov wanted to keep his queen closer to his king, if needed. Also, this move adds another attacker to aim at the white king's pawn cover.

14...Qb6 would probably lead to a dynamically balanced ending after 15.h5 Bxd4 16.Qxd4 Qxd4 17.Rxd4 f6 18.exf6 gxf6 ( 18...Rxf6 also looks okay for Black, despite bad bishop and a potentially weak e6-pawn. --- QUESTION: How can this assessment be accurate? --- ANSWER: Black remains active and soon generates counterplay along the f-file. Of course this assessment is purely intuitive on my part, but having played French for over three decades, I stick by it! Houdini also assesses at even, so I have an ally to my claim! )

**15.h5 Bc6**

Clearing the b-file and perhaps also contemplating ...Rfb8, ...a5 and ...b4.

**16.h6**

This move closes lines yet generates future back rank threats. White is ready to revive his old attacking project on the kingside, having created a wedge on h6.

**16...g6**

This is a trade-off: Every single remaining pawn sits on the wrong colour of Black's light-squared bishop. However, it will take White a long time to pry open Black's king, who may be safer than his c1-counterpart.

**17.g4**

The flotilla begins to move in the direction of Black's king.

**17...b4**

Immediately opening the b-file.

I would take an alternate route with 17...Rfb8 18.Ne2 a5 19.f5 b4 . Attackers migrate across an invisible border, in approach of their destination. After 20.Bxc5 Nxc5 21.Nd4 Rb6 22.Qf4 Bd7 23.Be2 Ne4 , my French instincts tell me Black's attack is more potent than White's.

**18.Bxc5 Qxc5 19.axb4 Qxb4 20.Ne2 Qxd2+**

Agreeing to the queen swap.

Black can also go for a sharp middle-game with 20...Qb7 21.Nd4 Rfb8 22.Qc3 Rc8 23.Qa3 Bb5 . Maybe the game is objectively even. I prefer White, since the f5-break is coming and White's king looks safe enough for now.

**21.Kxd2**

Principle: Centralize your king in an ending.

**21...Bb5**

This reminds me of the Chinese proverb "replacing shields and axes with jade and silks" which means "changing something bad to something good". The bad bishop finally emerges as a strong piece.

**22.Rc3**

I would have played 22.g5 to prevent Black's next move.

**22...g5!**

This flank thrust removes the pawn support for e5 and if successfully implemented, will be the precursor to wiping out White's centre. Always keep an eye out for this undermining move in the ending (and in the middle-game too if you are brave enough!).

**23.fxg5 Nxe5 24.Nd4 Nxg4**

More accurate than 24...Bxf1 25.Rxf1 Nxg4 26.Nc6! when White's activity (especially the dangerous reach of the c6-knight) easily compensates for the pawn deficit.

**25.Bxb5 axb5 26.Rf1**

26.Nxb5?? drops an exchange to 26...Nf2 with a double attack on d1 and the fork-square e4.

**26...Ne5 27.b3**

Denying Black's knight access to the c4-square.

**27...b4 28.Rc7**

Black picked up a pawn. Yet, White's pieces remain so dangerously active that Houdini rates the game dead even at 0.00.

**28...Rfc8 29.Ra1!**

Cute! White leaves two rooks seemingly en prise, but they aren't really hanging.

**29...Kf8**

Black wisely centralizes his king and rids himself of back rank cheapos.

**30.Rxa8 Rxa8 31.Rb7**

White regains the lost pawn.

**31...Ra1**

Going after the juicy target on g5, which soon transforms the game into a queening race.

**32.Rxb4 Rg1 33.Rb8+ Ke7 34.Rg8 Rg4 35.Kc3 Ng6 36.b4 e5 37.Nc6+ Kd6 38.Nd8 Rg3+**

Houdini frowns upon this natural move, preferring 38...d4+ 39.Kc4 Ke7 40.Nc6+ Kd6 41.b5 Rxg5 42.Rc8 d3! 43.cxd3 Rg1 and rates chances at even.

**39.Kb2 Rf3 40.b5**

White gets a superior version with 40.Rg7! Ke7 41.Nc6+ Kd6 42.b5 Kc5 43.Rxh7 e4 44.c3 e3 45.Nd4 Rf2+ 46.Kb3 e2 47.Nxe2 Rxe2 48.Rxf7 Kxb5 49.Rg7 Nf4 50.g6 Nxg6 51.Rxg6 Rh2 which is drawn, regardless of White's extra pawn.

**40...Kc5 41.Rg7 e4**

Black bases all hopes upon his passed e-pawn.

**42.Rxf7?!**

When our efforts come tumbling down, all we can do is start again at the beginning. This plan, which feels at variance with the position's requirements, endangers White.

A forced draw will result with the more accurate 42.b6! Kxb6 43.Nxf7 e3 44.Rxg6+ hxg6 45.h7 e2 46.h8=Q e1=Q 47.Qd8+ Ka6 48.Qd6+ Ka7 49.Qc5+ with perpetual check.

**42...Rxf7 43.Nxf7 Kxb5**

Advantage Black. It's three versus three but Black's e-pawn isn't blockaded, unlike White's kingside majority.

**44.Nd6+ Kc5 45.Ne8 e3 46.Kc1 d4 47.Kd1 Kc4 48.Nf6 Nf4!**

EXERCISE (critical decision): The actions of the past few moves culminate in a Battle of Gettysburg, the winner of which dictates the course of the war. White has a choice of plans: a) Fall back and defend with 49.Ne4. b) Sac a pawn to slow Black's queening attempt with 49...Ng6. One draws; the other loses. Which one would you play?

**49.g6??**

Well, they say suffering builds character. Sometimes we work out an excellent plan (in theory!) until the time arrives to work out the details. Upon reviewing a game we blow like this, it's difficult not to obsessively wonder how its course would have been, if only we had played the other move. White brushes aside substance to be lured by shadow. This does indeed slow Black down, but not enough! He draws with...

ANSWER: 49.Ne4! In times of desperation, the key to survival is to cling to that which matters most. In this case, it is paramount to halt Black's queening attempt. 49...d3 50.cxd3+ Kxd3 51.Ng3 is drawn, since Black is unable to win a piece with 51...e2+? 52.Nxe2 Nxe2?? 53.g6 and White promotes.

**49...Nxg6 50.Nxh7 d3 51.Ng5**

51.cxd3+ Kxd3 52.Ng5 e2+ 53.Ke1 Ke3! 54.Ne4 and the exile finally returns to his homeland, after fruitless wanderings with 54...Ne5 and will deliver mate on the next move.

**51...e2+**

A single spy in your pay, having infiltrated the enemy's inner circle, is more valuable to a general than an entire battalion outside the enemy's gate.

**52.Kd2**

EXERCISE (critical decision): Same exercise but with different colour! Black's choice: a) 52...dxc2 or b) 52...e1=Q+. Only one of the lines wins. Which one? --- ANSWER: b) Deflection.

**52...e1=Q+!**

The person cops hate the most is the perpetual suspect, who always seems to evade conviction of the crime, due to lack of hard evidence. Black's e-pawn, somehow fits this description. Just when it appears as if White is holding a draw, the advanced e-pawn pulls a fast one, drawing White's king one critical tempo away from the queening square. How wonderful when our idle daydreams of glory surpass reality and come to fruition over the board.

The careless 52...dxc2?? is met by 53.Nf3 which allows White to escape with a draw.

**53.Kxe1 dxc2 54.Kd2 Kb3**

"We will instil within you the virtues of toil and industry," Black's king informs his sweating brother, who still hopes to outrun the c-pawn.

Black wins the following way: After 54...Kb3 55.Kc1 Ne5! 56.h7 when this single unarmed soldier storms a heavily fortified garrison, it isn't hard to predict the result of the battle. Following 56...Nd3+ 57.Kd2 c1=Q+ 58.Kxd3 Qh1 59.Ke3 Qh4 60.Kf3 Kc4 61.Ke2 Qh5+ 62.Kf2 Kd3 63.Kf1 Ke3 , White is in zugzwang. "Your seed is wiped off the earth and you shall die without successor," Black's queen gloats to the now deposed white king. --- SUMMARY: Prepare for a sharp, opposite wings castling position in this chapter!

0-1

### (15)Polgar, J.   --   Shirov, A. 2: EuroTel Trophy, Prague  1999   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Bc5 9.Qd2 O-O 10.O-O-O a6 11.h4 Nxd4 12.Bxd4 b5 13.Rh3 b4**

More natural than 13...Bb7 , which we looked at in the previous game. Black hurries on with his attack, giving White's knight the heave-ho from c3.

**14.Ne2**

Believe it or not, I think Black actually stands slightly better after this natural move, where White's knight heads for the d4 blockade square.

More popular and probably superior is 14.Na4 which we have looked at in the previous game and I don't believe White extracts anything from that path either.

**14...a5 15.Qe3**

QUESTION: Is the plan of adding pressure to c5 really effective for White? After all, Black can cover c5 more times than White can attack it. --- ANSWER: I think the main motivation behind her move is that she wants to reinforce e5 to eventually play for f5.

After 15.h5 Ba6 16.Qe3 Qc7 17.Rg3 Rfc8 , Black's attack already looks quicker. 18.Rd2? ( 18.f5 Bxe2 19.Qxe2 Bxd4 20.Rxd4 had to be tried but even here Black has several paths to an edge ) 18...Bxd4 19.Qxd4 Nc5! and there is no defence to the coming ...Ne4, which wins material. 20.Re3 Ne4 21.Rxe4 dxe4 22.Qxe4 and Black is winning with the material advantage and still possessing the attack, R.Sprangers-D.Stellwagen, Arnhem 2006.

**15...Qc7 16.Bxc5 Nxc5 17.Nd4**

Contemplating f5 at a later stage.

**17...a4!?**

QUESTION: Why wasn't Shirov interested in swapping away his bad bishop?

ANSWER: Of course 17...Ba6 was possible, but strangely enough, the "badness" of the bishop tends to be an overrated selling point for White in this variation. In my research, I noticed several examples where the lone "bad" light-squared bishop more than held its own against a White knight or bishop. Also, if Black wants to play ...f6 at some future point, he may need the light-squared bishop to protect e6. --- Let's see what happens after 17...Ba6: 18.Bxa6 Rxa6 19.h5 was R.Altrock-H.Offenborn, correspondence 2000. At this point, Houdini recommends 19...Ne4 20.h6 g6 21.Kb1 a4 with the idea of ...a3, which is pretty close to what happened in the game. White already looks uncomfortable.

**18.Kb1 a3**

This move imposes burdensome restrictions upon White's king and the question of his safety.

**19.b3**

This forced weakening move acts as a corrosive acid upon the dark squares surrounding White's king.

**19...Ba6!**

For so long, the bishop prayed for a sign and now receives it.

The text move is more accurate than 19...Ne4 20.Nb5 Qa5 21.Bd3 Bd7 22.Bxe4 Bxb5 23.Bf3 Rfc8 24.f5! when White generates serious kingside counterplay. After 24...Qc7 25.Rd2 exf5 26.Bxd5 Bc6 27.Qc5 , chances look balanced.

**20.Bxa6 Rxa6 21.Qe1 Rb6**

Black threatens ...Ne4, so White's next move looks pretty much forced.

**22.c3**

Worry tends to precede outright fear. White isn't simply indulging in exaggerated precautions, since Black's ...Ne4 and ...Nc3+ threat is very real. Polgar takes steps to absorb the coming wave of attack.

**22...Qb7 23.Rc1 Ne4 24.cxb4 Rxb4**

White remains on the defensive, having to watch for tricks on b3, c3, d4 and even c4.

**25.Rd3**

White is also in trouble after 25.Nc6 Rb6 26.Nd4 Rc8 27.Rh1 Rc4! 28.Qe3 Rbb4 29.Ne2 h5 .

**25...Rc4!**

Shirov begins a cold-blooded attack, divorced from emotion.

**26.Rxc4**

If White plays a waiting game with 26.Rdd1 , 26...Rfc8 forces 27.Rxc4 dxc4 28.Ka1 cxb3 29.axb3 h5 and White's king remains exposed. Her pieces are also tied down to defence of numerous weaknesses like b3, c3, d4 and even the kingside pawns.

**26...dxc4 27.Rd1**

EXERCISE (combination alert): White's position trembles like a tuning fork: Attackers convene, conspiring devious methods of deposing White's king. How did Shirov continue his attack? --- ANSWER: Double attack. Both b3 and g2 are simultaneously threatened.

**27...Nc5!**

Shirov's genius is one of a general who always retains presence of mind, even in the most cluttered battlefields.

**28.Qc3 Qxg2 29.b4**

29.bxc4 Qe4+ 30.Ka1 Qxf4 is also hopeless for White.

**29...Nd3 30.Qxa3**

EXERCISE (combination alert): When we are in desperation mode, we snatch at any hope which presents itself - however small. White's queen appears to be one of those seemingly vivacious women who we suspect hides her depression from the world. White's two connected queenside passers would be great...if only it were an ending! Examine the position carefully and you will discover something amiss in White's defensive barrier. We don't need Sherlock Holmes' powers of inductive reasoning to find Black's trick.

30.b5 is also hopeless as 30...Qd5 31.Ka1 Nxf4 32.b6 Qc5 33.Rb1 Nd5 wins.

**30...Ra8!**

ANSWER: Double attack. White's queen can't afford to leave her protection of a2. --- Black's forces run riot over the queenside.

**31.Rxd3**

No choice.

31.Qc3 Qxa2# is mate! The days of the queen's benign indifference are over.

**31...cxd3**

Also crushing is 31...Rxa3 "I'm afraid your presence is superfluous," Black's rook informs the queen. 32.Rxa3 is met by 32...g5! which eliminates back rank vulgarities. 33.fxg5 Qg1+ 34.Kc2 Qxd4 and Black wins.

**32.Qxd3**

The queen performs a clumsy, embarrassed curtsey and quickly leaves the room.

**32...Qxa2+ 33.Kc1 Qa1+**

33...Ra3! 34.Qe4 Qa1+ 35.Kd2 Qc3+ 36.Ke2 Ra2+ is a quicker finish.

**34.Kd2 Rd8 35.Ke3**

White's grievously wounded king is top priority in what is now essentially a triage unit.

**35...Qe1+**

"You demand redress for past injustices. Yet how can I, the law itself, be anything but just?" Black's queen asks White's king.

After 35...Qe1+ 36.Kf3 , White's king, a hunted fawn, breathes raggedly from the chase and 36...Qxb4 ends the contest, since after 37.Ke3 , Black can nonchalantly trade all the pieces for a won pawn ending if he so wishes. --- SUMMARY: This game raises a side question: Where did White go wrong? Where was White's initial error which allowed her position to degenerate? The answer I suspect may be 14 Ne2 which may be inaccurate. However the superior 14 Na4 leads to no more than dynamic equality for White.

Black can also get greedy here and accept with 19...gxf5!? . Houdini worked the game out to a draw (!) after 20.Kb1 f6 21.exf6 Qxf6 22.Qf2 Rfc8 23.g4 Bc6 24.Nc5 fxg4 25.Qg1 Nxc5 26.Qxg4+! Kh8 27.Rdf1 Qe7 28.Qg7+! Qxg7 29.hxg7+ Kxg7 30.Rxh7+ Kg8 31.Rg1+ Kf8 32.Rf1+ Kg8 with perpetual check. ) ( 19...Bc6 20.fxe6 Qg5+ 21.Kb1 Qxe5 22.Qxe5 Nxe5 23.Nc5 fxe6 24.Rhe1 Nxd3 25.cxd3 d4 26.Nxe6 Rfe8 with a dynamically balanced ending, J.Nunn-S.Lputian, Manila 1992. Also note that Black's remaining bad bishop isn't so bad anymore. This scenario tends to be a standard feature of this variation. ( ) ) ) ( 15...Qa5 16.b3 Bb7 17.Kb1 Bc6 18.Nb2 Qc5 and Black has equalized, B.Belotti-T.Luther, Saint Vincent 1998. )

**14...a5 15.Qe3**

15.Kb1 Ba6 16.f5 and Black's king becomes less safe after White achieves f5. However, the e5-pawn gets weaker as well, so it's a trade-off. After 16...Bxe2 17.Bxe2 Qc7 18.Rhe1 h6 19.Bb5 Bxd4 20.Qxd4 Rfc8 21.Bd3 a4 , E.Saglione-J.Dorner, correspondence 2011, play may continue 22.f6 gxf6 23.exf6 Qg3 24.Bb5 Nc5 25.Re3 Qg5 26.Re5 Qg3 27.Re3 with a draw by repetition of moves.

**15...Qc7 16.Kb1**

16.Bxc5 Nxc5 17.Nd4 a4 18.Kb1 Ba6 19.f5 a3 20.Rh4? ( White had to try 20.h6 g6 21.fxg6 fxg6 22.Bxa6 Rxa6 23.Rdf1 Raa8 ) 20...Ne4 21.Bd3 was M.Apicella-O.Kurmann, Lausanne 2006. --- Black has a strong attack if he continues with 21...Bxd3! 22.cxd3 b3! 23.Nxb3 (a forced move) 23...axb2 24.dxe4 Rxa2! 25.exd5! Rfa8 with the threat of ...Ra1+.

**16...Ba6 17.Bxc5**

White can try to continue pressing on the kingside with a frontal pawn assault with 17.h6 g6 18.g4 Rfc8 19.Bxc5 Bxe2 ! 20.Bxe2 Nxc5 21.Bd3 a4 22.f5 as in A.Rodrigues-P.Hoehensteiger, Dos Hermanas 2003 but Black's position looks favourable after 22...Rab8 23.Rhf1 a3 24.fxg6 fxg6 25.b3 Nd7 26.Qd4 Qxe5 27.Qxe5 Nxe5 .

**17...Nxc5 18.Ng3!?**

QUESTION: Isn't this move awkward, since the knight blocks White's g-pawn? --- ANSWER: Yes, this is awkward and also curiously meek from the normally aggressive Topalov. White plays to keep Black's knight out of e4, but in doing so, may be misplacing his own knight.

On the other hand, I don't like White's game very much after 18.h6 g6 19.Nd4 Bxf1 20.Rhxf1 Ne4 21.g4 a4 22.Rd3 Rfc8 23.Ka1 a3 24.b3 Ra5 and Black intends to increase the pressure with ...Rc5, A.Cilloniz Razzeto-J.Dorner, correspondence 2011.

**18...Rfc8**

18...h6!? is untested and may not be such a bad idea, since White now lacks the prying g4-g5. Black's attack looks faster than White's after 19.f5 Nd7 20.Re1 a4 21.f6 Rfc8 22.Rc1 and now simplest is 22...Qxe5 with a winning position.

**19.Rc1!?**

Wow. We are unaccustomed to such defensive zeal from Topa's side.

**19...a4 20.Bxa6**

A new move.

Let's have a look at other options: Morozevich suggests the line 20.f5 Nd7 21.h6 g6 22.fxe6 fxe6 23.Nh5!? and Houdini, as expected, declares it unsound after 23...b3! 24.c4 a3! 25.axb3 Qa5 . The trouble is White now really does lose a piece after 26.Qc3 a2+ 27.Ka1 Qxc3 28.Rxc3 gxh5 when White doesn't get enough compensation.

20.h6 g6 21.Bxa6 Rxa6 22.Qd4 Rc6! 23.Qd2 ( 23.Qxb4?? walks into 23...Nd3! ) 23...Qb6 24.Rhd1 and Houdini rates this as a solid plus for Black, whose attack is more potent, S.Birk-M.Duppel, Schwaebisch Gmuend 2002.

**20...Rxa6 21.Rhd1**

White has to think purely about defence of his king.

**21...a3 22.b3 Rc6**

Black exerts intense pressure along the c-file. This hamstrings White's goal to attack on the kingside.

**23.Qd4**

The acquisition of the much desired d4-square does little to cheer White's position.

**23...Na6 24.Rd2**

EXERCISE (planning): What was once iron in White's position, now feels closer to the texture of marshmallow. This one is really difficult and you will have to think outside the box to solve it. Here are the facts: Black exerts pressure down the c-pawn and ties White down. Yet Black has difficulty making progress. The solution feels distant and hazy. We require the focusing/magnifying power of logic to draw out the correct plan. White survived the first wave of Black's initiative. Now comes the second. How did Black neatly express his wishes? --- ANSWER:

**24...Qe7!**

Black intends to complete the paralysis of White's position with this queen shift. --- Dual purpose: 1. Black follows the principle: If you exert pressure on a wing but your tied-up opponent continues to hold, then open a second front. Black intends ...Qh4!, after which White's overworked forces experience difficulty covering threats on both wings. --- 2. Black defends b4, which frees the knight to swing into b5, via c7.

**25.Qd3**

25.Rh1 Nc7 26.Ne2 Nb5 (the knight's serpentine manner makes all those around him uncomfortable) 27.Qd3 Nc3+ 28.Nxc3 Rxc3 29.Qd4 h6 30.g4 Rg3 31.Rg1 Rcc3 32.Rdd1 Qh4!? 33.Rxg3 Rxg3 34.Qxb4 Qxg4 35.Rc1 Kh7 36.Qxa3 Qxf4 37.Qd6 Rh3 38.a4 and we reach an exceedingly sharp ending, where Black retains the superior chances. Still, the sense of Black's inevitable victory bleeds away and he must play exceedingly accurate to force the win. 38...Qe4 (The threat is ...Rxb3+) 39.Kb2 Qd4+ 40.Kb1 Qa7 41.Qb4 Rxh5 42.a5 Rxe5 43.Qb5 f5 44.a6 Re4 45.Qc6 f4 and if 46.c3 intending Qb7, 46...f3 47.Qb7 Qe3 48.a7 f2 49.a8=Q Qd3+ 50.Kb2 Qd2+ 51.Rc2 Qxc2+ 52.Kxc2 Re2+! 53.Kd3 f1=Q and Black, although down heavy material, is the one who forces mate.

**25...Qh4!**

We get an uneasy feeling about the queen's intention, the way a seasoned police detective's sixth sense tingles when a criminal enters the room. Black's last move sends White scrambling to cover his kingside weak points and binds him in chains of passivity.

**26.Qf3**

The queen decides upon a moody inspection of the grounds.

**26...Rc3 27.Rd3 h6!**

No rush. Morozevich calmly creates luft for his king. White's position is a rudderless ship, caught in the grips of powerful currents pulling him in two directions.

**28.f5?**

An error may have been committed in the distant past, yet echoes of its effects continue to linger in the present. White incurs further debt which he can ill afford. It's always a sobering moment when we discover that our plans aren't working out the way we intended. In such cases, falling back to passive defence is the strategy all natural attackers resolutely loathe. So Topalov lashes out, fearing that if he remains passive, Black may continue to strengthen his position. But in doing so, he undermines the integrity of his central structure. --- QUESTION: True, but can we blame White for not curling up in a ball and simply reacting to Black's whims?

ANSWER: In some positions we are required to do just that. White's position may simply be lost, no matter what he plays. But he puts up greater resistance in the line 28.Ne2 White's pacifist knight wants no part of Black's war and hopes to earn conscientious objector status. 28...Rxd3 29.Qxd3 Nc5 30.Qh3 Qe7 31.Qe3 Ne4 32.Rh1 f6! 33.Qd4 fxe5 34.Qxe5 Qc5! 35.c4 ( Black has no choice as 35.Qxe6+?? loses to 35...Kh8 36.c4 Rd8! 37.Rd1 Qf2 38.Rxd5 Qe1+ 39.Nc1 Nc3+ 40.Kc2 Qxe6 ) 35...Kh7! 36.Nd4 Nd2+ 37.Ka1 ( 37.Kc2 is met with 37...Nxc4! 38.Qxg7+ Kxg7 39.Nxe6+ Kf7 40.Nxc5 Nd6 winning a piece ) 37...dxc4 38.Qxc5 Rxc5 and Black is winning.

**28...Qg5?!**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Morozevich has access to a path which forces White's collapse. Where is it? --- ANSWER: Demolition of king's position/pawn promotion/zwischenzug.

28...Rxd3! 29.cxd3 ( Black's devious point is that 29.Qxd3 walks into 29...Rc3 30.Qxa6 Qd4! Zwischenzug, threatening to force mate with ...Rxb3+! next move. 31.Qe2 Rxg3 32.c3 bxc3 is hopeless for White ) 29...Rxc1+ 30.Kxc1 Qd4! 31.Kd2 Nc5 32.Qe2 Nxb3+! and White is unable to recapture, since the a-pawn would promote to a new queen.

**29.Qf1?**

White had to try 29.Ne2 Rxd3 30.cxd3 Rxc1+ 31.Nxc1 Qd2 32.Qe2 Qf4 .

**29...Rxd3 30.Qxd3 Nc5 31.Qf3**

EXERCISE (planning): Find Black's winning plan. --- ANSWER:

**31...Nd7!**

Technically, this is the second best move, which wins e5 and continues the pressure. But from a practical standpoint, it is the simplest, and therefore the best! Even stronger was the computer solution.

ANSWER #2: 31...Qd2! intending the potent ...Qd4. 32.Nf1 ( 32.Ne2 Ne4 33.fxe6 fxe6 34.Qg4 Kh8 35.Qf3 Qxe2! wins ) 32...Qd4 33.c3 Qxe5 34.Ng3 Na4!! and if 35.bxa4 , the b-pawn, a socialist at heart, begins his dream for redistribution of wealth, from the rich to the poor - namely, himself. 35...bxc3 36.Kc2 Qd4 37.Nf1 Rb8 and White cannot avoid massive material losses after...Rb2+.

QUESTION: I understand that after 31...Nd7 , the e5-pawn is in danger. But it's just one pawn. Isn't Topalov's resignation premature? --- ANSWER: It would be premature at a club level but perhaps justified at the super-GM level. Let's look at a possible continuation if Topa had played on: 32.Qf2 Nxe5 33.Ne2 Qf6 (with the threat of dirty tricks on b2) 34.Nd4 ( 34.Qd4 Qxf5 35.Qxb4 Nc4! setting up the threat of ...Qe5. Now if 36.bxc4 Qe5 37.Qc3 Qxe2 38.Qxa3 Rxc4 , both g2 and h5 hang, leaving Black with a dominating position as well as the material advantage ) 34...Nc6 35.Rd1 Na7! (threat: ...Nb5) 36.Qe2 e5 37.Nf3 e4 38.Nd4 Rc3 39.Qd2 e3 40.Qc1 and it's not a good sign if you must make a move like this! Following 40...Qe5 41.Nf3 Qxf5 , there goes a second pawn, with Black owning the entire board. --- SUMMARY: After 13 h5, we proceed pretty much as we did in the first game, with our ...b4 and ...a5 plan, which to my eyes, offers us dynamic equality.

0-1

### (17)Karjakin, S.   --   Andreikin, D. 4: FIDE World Cup, Tromso  2013   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Bc5 9.Qd2 O-O 10.O-O-O a6 11.Qf2**

In my opinion, this line may be one of our biggest defensive challenges of the chapter. --- QUESTION: The queen is already developed. Why move it again rather than to develop? --- ANSWER: 1. At some point, White would like to play Bd3, which is impossible with the queen on d2, since the d4-pawn hangs. --- 2. White prepares to swing the queen to h4, in the vicinity of Black's king. --- 3. White's queen/bishop line-up on the g1-a7 diagonal keeps an eye out on key dark squares d4, c5 and b6. Black, in some instances, may experience some difficulty engineering ...Nc5 or ...Nb6 later on.

**11...Bxd4!**

This move scores better than 11...Nxd4 12.Bxd4 Qc7 13.Bd3 b5 14.Qh4 . There we go. White's idea comes to fruition: A queen on h4, in conjunction with a bishop on d3, induces weaknesses in Black's camp. 14...h6 15.Ne2 f6 16.Qg4 Bxd4?! This occurred in V.Kramnik-T.Radjabov, Linares 2003. Now White can play ( 16...Qb6 looks okay for Black ) 17.Qxe6+! Kh8 18.Qf5 Be3+ 19.Kb1 g6 20.Qxg6 Nxe5 21.fxe5 fxe5 22.Nc3 which is in White's favour. Kramnik didn't play this way but went on to win brilliantly anyway. The game is annotated in Kramnik: Move by Move.

**12.Bxd4 b5**

QUESTION: We allow White to abscond with the bishop pair? --- ANSWER: Yes, because doing so costs White time, a precious commodity in opposing wing attacks.

**13.Be3**

After 13.Bd3 b4 : ( 14.Ne2 a5 15.Bc5 (White got nervous about Black's coming attack and insisted that Black exchange off his bishop) 15...Nxc5 16.Qxc5 Bb7 17.Bb5 , J.Friedel-J.Ehlvest, Boca Raton 2008. The position looks balanced after 17...Rc8 18.Qe3 Qc7 . --- QUESTION: Shouldn't Black fear the line 19.Bxc6 Bxc6 20.Nd4 after which Black is stuck with the bad bishop? --- ANSWER: Here is Houdini's analysis. Watch how Black's bishop proves itself a competent defender/attacker against White's formidable knight: 20...Bd7 21.h4 a4 22.Kb1 f6 23.exf6 Rxf6 24.g3 a3 25.b3 h5! 26.Rhe1 Be8! (intending ...Bg6, when Black's bad bishop holds its own) and 27.f5? isn't possible since Black has 27...e5! 28.Qxe5 Qc3 with a winning position. ) ( 14.Na4 a5 15.Bb5 Nxd4 16.Qxd4 Qc7 17.Rhe1 Rb8 18.Bd3 b3! 19.a3 ( 19.axb3 Rxb3 20.f5 Rb4 21.Qc3 Qb8 looks slightly better for Black as well ) 19...Ba6 20.Re2 Qc6 21.Kb1 Rfc8 22.cxb3 Rxb3 23.Bxa6 Qxa6 and Black's attack progresses, while White's hasn't begun, J. Dourerassou-G.Dizdar, Paris 2007. )

**13...Qa5**

Threat: ...b4. --- QUESTION: Why bother with 13...Qa5, when Black can play the immediate ...b4 instead? --- ANSWER: 13...Qa5 is designed to prevent Na4. We discuss your question in the next game.

**14.Kb1 b4 15.Ne2 Qc7**

QUESTION: Isn't this a waste of time? --- ANSWER: No. The queen performed her duties on a5, preventing Na4. Having done so, she now gets out of the path of her coming pawn storm and prepares ...a5.

**16.Nd4**

White can try to storm the barricade with 16.h4 a5 17.h5 Ba6 18.Nd4 Nxd4 19.Bxd4 Rfc8 20.f5 Nc5 21.Bxa6 Rxa6 22.f6? as in M.Llaneza Vega-J.Kipper, Germany 2011. At this point, Black should play ( the correct move order was 22.Qe2 Rc6 23.f6 gxf6 24.exf6 Kh8 with a sharply unbalanced situation ) 22...Ne4! and if 23.Qf4 gxf6 24.Qg4+ Kh8 25.exf6 Qxc2+ 26.Ka1 Rg8 , White is down material and I don't see an efficient way to fan an attack.

**16...Nxd4 17.Bxd4 a5 18.Rd3!?**

A pure piece-play interpretation of the position. White intends to swing the rook over to either h3 or g3.

A couple of alternatives: 18.h4 a4 19.Rh3 Ba6 20.h5 Rfc8 21.h6 g6 22.g4 Bxf1 23.Rxf1 Nc5 24.Bxc5 and the players agreed to a draw in this equal position, H.Vatter-J.Kipper, Germany 2009.

18.Bb5 Ba6 19.Bxd7!? Qxd7 . --- QUESTION: It feels to me like the opposite-coloured bishops favour White here? Am I mistaken? --- ANSWER: The opposite-coloured bishops factor certainly sharpens the game considerably. According to Houdini, Black is no worse though. I played through many scenarios and Black didn't stand worse at the end of any of them. 20.g4 a4 21.b3 Rfc8 22.f5 , V.Yemelin-V.Zvjaginsev, St Petersburg 2013. After 22...axb3 23.cxb3 Bb5 24.f6 Qb7 25.Qe3 , White threatens Qg5 and Black counters with his own mate threat with 25...Qa6 26.Rd2 Rc6! 27.Rhd1 ( not 27.Qg5? Bd3+ 28.Ka1 Bg6 when suddenly Black's king is absolutely safe, while the same can't be said for White's king ) 27...Qc8 28.Qg5 Qf8 29.fxg7 Qxg7 and the game remains uneasily equal.

**18...f6!**

A new move which seeks counterplay down the f-file, based on the principle: Counter in the centre when attacked on the wing. Andreikin flexibly adjusts to the changing circumstances.

This move looks like an improvement over the automatic 18...Ba6? 19.Rg3 Rfc8 20.f5 Nc5? M.Szelag-F.Lamprecht, Germany 2007. At this point, White generates a strong attack after ( 20...Kh8 is necessary but I still don't like Black's position ) 21.f6! Ne4 22.Rxg7+ Kh8 23.Rxh7+! Kxh7 24.Qh4+ Kg8 25.c3! Qd8 ( 25...bxc3?? walks into mate after 26.Qh6 ) 26.Be3!! initiating a wicked attack for White with the threat of Bh6!.

**19.Rf3!?**

My friend and neighbour (he lives only three blocks from me but both of us are too lazy to walk to each other's house and always drive!), noted chessologist IM John Watson, offers two variations on Chesspublishing.com and claims they lead to a slight plus for White. Let's see if he is correct: 19.exf6 Nxf6 20.Qh4 feels fully equal to me after 20...Qf7 21.Rg3 Ba6 . Now how does White make progress on the kingside attack? I don't see a way and actually prefer Black.

19.Qh4 is given an exclam by Watson. After 19...fxe5 20.fxe5 Qd8 , Watson rates this position at "+=", while I see it as dynamically balanced, for the following reasons: 1. Black can eliminate White's bishop pair with ...Ba6. This could leave White with the slightly inferior minor piece in the ending. --- 2. The e5-pawn may become a target if queens come off the board. --- 3. Black owns the f-file and soon, the c-file too for his rooks. Conclusion: White's kingside attacking chances seem to balance out with Black's long-term strategic superiority (if he or she doesn't get mated!). --- QUESTION: Great. So two IMs analyse the position and contradict the other. Who am I supposed to believe? --- ANSWER: In cases like this, your best bet would be to generate complete faith in your always truthful, near-infallible writer (who many believe to be a beacon of clarity in an otherwise perplexed chess world) and disbelieve half-truths and misinformation circulated by those who disagree with him.

**19...fxe5!?**

Risky.

I like 19...f5! Principle: Close the position when your opponent has the bishop pair or bishop versus your knight. Houdini worked the game out to a draw in the line 20.Rg1 Ba6 21.Bxa6 Rxa6 22.g4 fxg4 23.Rxg4 Rc6 24.f5 exf5 25.Rxf5 Rxf5 26.Qxf5 Nf8! 27.e6 Nxe6 28.Qxd5 Rd6 29.Rxg7+ Qxg7 30.Qxd6 Nxd4 31.Qd5+ Qf7 32.Qd8+ Qf8 33.Qd5+ with perpetual check.

**20.fxe5 Ba6**

20...Rxf3!? 21.gxf3 opens the g-file but also impairs White's structure.

**21.Bxa6 Rxa6 22.h4?!**

Watson quite rightfully asks: "What does this do?" This looks like a pawn push ill-adapted to a position better suited for piece play.

White should continue 22.Rxf8+! Nxf8 23.Bc5 Ng6 24.Bd6 which keeps the advantage after 24...Qc4 25.b3 Qh4 26.g3 Qg4 27.Rf1 h6 28.Qf7+ Kh7 29.Qf3 Qd4 (threat: ...a4!) 30.Qd3 Qxd3 31.cxd3 and I like White, who has multiple infiltration points with his rook. Also, at least one Black queenside pawn may be fixed on a dark square. I assess this at "+=".

**22...Raa8 23.h5 h6**

I don't think it's the end of the world for Black to allow White to advance the pawn to h6.

After 23...Rac8 24.h6 g6 , I don't see White exploiting the weakened dark squares around Black's king. Also, White's h-pawn gets weaker and weaker with each passing exchange.

**24.b3 Rac8 25.Rxf8+ Rxf8 26.Qe3 Qd8 27.Qh3 Qe7 28.g4?!**

EXERCISE (combination alert): After this move, we observe tell-tale signs that White's position is in the throes of decline. White is willing to endure privation to further his cause, but this proves to be a waste of resources. A move based on the philosophy: A key requisite of an insurgency is the ability to establish a base from which to launch guerrilla attacks. Karjakin, who continues to frolic in a golden mist of optimism, doesn't allow trivial matters - like the fact that he has no attack - to keep him from aggressive overtures. White's rash move was condemned by the noted chessologist as well. The weakening of White's pawns outweighs the attacking factor and his structure grows rigid, as if stricken with tetanus. --- How can Black show that White had overextended on his last move?

Correct was 28.Qe3 .

**28...Rf4?!**

Black rises to the bait, but goes after the wrong pawn. This wins a pawn but allows White counterplay.

ANSWER: Black incorrectly rejected 28...Qg5! 29.Qg3 ( perhaps White should kick into desperation mode with 29.Be3!? Qxe5 30.g5 d4 31.Bxd4!? Qxd4 32.Qxe6+ Kh7 33.Qg6+ Kh8 34.gxh6 Qf6 35.hxg7+ Qxg7 36.Qd6 Ne5 with some practical chances ) 29...Rf4! when this double attack renders White's kingside structure garbage-like. After 30.Be3 Rxg4 31.Bxg5 Rxg3 32.Bd8 Nxe5 33.Bxa5 Nc6 34.Bc7 Rg5 , Black safely keeps a clean extra pawn.

**29.Be3! Re4 30.Rg1!?**

A war council debates the best route to Black's king. Karjakin plays for the win, thinking the g-file is the principle artery which nourishes his attack. The trouble is, it isn't so easy to open the file. My feeling is that White has squandered energy in this distracted flirtation.

Maybe he should have opted for the nuclear option 30.g5!? hxg5 31.Bxg5! Qxg5 32.Qxe6+ Kh7 33.Qxd7 Qxe5 34.Qf7 Re1+ 35.Rxe1 Qxe1+ 36.Kb2 Qe5+ 37.Kc1 with a draw, that is if Black wants a truce.

**30...Rxe5 31.Qg3! Qf7 32.g5 hxg5 33.Bxg5 Rf5 34.Bc1!?**

Karjakin, perhaps unwisely, rejects the ending after 34.h6! g6 and here, White can pull off a double attack on a5 and g6 with 35.Bd8! Kh7 36.Bxa5 Rf1+ 37.Rxf1 Qxf1+ 38.Kb2 Qf6+ 39.c3 bxc3+ 40.Bxc3 e5 . Houdini helpfully rates this position as "0.00" in this ultra-sharp ending.

**34...Rxh5 35.Qc7 d4?!**

Inaccurate.

Black has 35...Ne5! 36.Qxa5 Nf3 37.Rg4 Rh1 38.Qxb4 Qf6! (threat: ...Rxc1+, followed by ...Qa1 mate!) 39.Qb8+ Kh7 40.Qf4 Qc3! (setting up ...Nd2+) 41.Rg2 Rd1! 42.a4 and the hunt for the White's king is the equivalent of aiming a shot at an elderly parrot in its cage. Following 42...Nd2+! , White must give up his queen, since 43.Rxd2?? is met by 43...Rxc1+! 44.Kxc1 Qa1# mate!

**36.Qc8+?!**

White has excellent chances to hold the game after 36.Qd8+! Kh7 37.Bb2 e5 38.Qxa5 .

**36...Kh7 37.Qc4 Ne5!?**

I'm not so certain such an expressive gesture is necessary at this point. Andreikin hands over a pawn, realizing that a knight on f3 creates a dampening effect on White's counterplay.

The mundane 37...Qf2 leads to a clear advantage after 38.Qd3+ Rf5 39.Rd1 Nf6! and if 40.Qxd4? Qxd4 41.Rxd4 g5 as Black is too fast in the ending.

**38.Qxd4 Nf3**

The knight swings from tree to tree, in Tarzan fashion.

**39.Qe4+**

I doubt White can save himself in the line 39.Qd3+! Qf5 40.Rd1 Qxd3 41.Rxd3 Rf5 42.Rd7 .

**39...Qf5 40.Rg4**

40.Qxf5+ exf5 41.Rf1 Nd4 and Black's two kingside-passers should win the day.

**40...Qxe4 41.Rxe4 Re5**

The ending's complexity level baffles both sides.

After 41...e5! , White appears too slow in the race as 42.Re3 Rh3 43.c3 bxc3 44.Rxc3 g5 45.a3 g4 46.b4 axb4 47.axb4 Kg6 48.b5 Nd4 wins for Black.

**42.Rc4?!**

With this inaccuracy, White's streak of luck comes to an end.

White may yet hold the draw after 42.Rf4! Rf5 43.Re4 e5 44.c3 bxc3 45.Kc2 g5 46.Kxc3 Kg6 47.Ra4 Nd4 48.Be3 Rf3 49.Kd2 Ne6 50.Rxa5 Kf5 51.Ra7 Nf4 52.b4 Ke4 53.Bg1 Rg3 54.Bc5 g4 55.a4 Ne6 56.a5 Rd3+ 57.Kc2 g3 58.a6 g2 59.Bg1 Ra3 60.Kb2 Ra4! 61.Ra8 Rxb4+ 62.Ka2 Nd4 63.Rg8 Ra4+ 64.Kb2 Rxa6 65.Rxg2 , though a draw isn't automatic even here. White probably has better than 50% chance of holding this.

**42...g5 43.c3 bxc3 44.Kc2!?**

This plan is loaded down with diversionary clutter. In such rotten situations, all we can do is to try and work through the grief. Karjakin hands over a second pawn, engineering a trap which doesn't work. The trouble is nothing else works either.

Black should also beat White in the queening race after 44.Rxc3 Rf5 45.Rc6 Nd4 46.Rc7+ Kg6 .

**44...Re2+ 45.Kxc3 Rxa2!**

Some "traps" are worth falling into.

**46.Bb2**

This is White's idea. He seals in Black's rook and traps it with Kc2 and Kb1. But Black doesn't really need the rook to win!

**46...Kg6**

The king chips in, offering supplemental assistance to the worthy cause of pawn promotion.

**47.Kc2 Kf5 48.Kb1**

Trapping the rook but still losing the game. "Rest assured, you will be brought to account for your treachery," White's king warns the rook. The rook responds: "There is no spectacle more ridiculous than a weak person who attempts to appear menacing, all the while hoping no one sees through the bluff."

**48...Rxb2+ 49.Kxb2 g4 50.Rc5+ e5**

As they say in internet games: "gg"- good game!

White's b-pawn is too slow after 50...e5 51.Rxa5 g3 52.Ra1 . Somehow, this rook's perspiration-soaked face reminds us of Richard Nixon's performance in his 1960 presidential debate with John F. Kennedy.

SUMMARY: Let's be ready for 11.Qf2, when White may directly go after our king, planning Bd3 and Qh4. We answer the plan with 11...Bxd4! and 12...b5.<addx start="12...b5"/>

### (18)Ragger, M.   --   Stellwagen, D. 5: World Junior Ch (U20), Yerevan  2007   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Bc5 9.Qd2 O-O 10.O-O-O a6 11.Qf2 Bxd4 12.Bxd4 b5 13.Be3 b4**

QUESTION: No ...Qa5 this time? --- ANSWER: ...Qa5 prevents Na4, but as we have seen, Black later loses a tempo to play ...Qc7 to make way for his a-pawn. So in this case, Stellwagen deems it best to save a move and allow White's knight to go to a4.

**14.Na4 a5 15.h4**

QUESTION: You said one of the reasons White plays Qf2 is to later try for a pure piece attack on Black's king with Qh4. Doesn't White's last move ruin this plan? --- ANSWER: Correct. Once the h-pawn is pushed, Qh4 ceases to be a worry for Black.

Another try is 15.Bb5 Qc7 16.Qe2 (preventing ...Ba6) 16...Ncb8! (oh, no you don't! The fight is on for the critical a6 (!) square) 17.Kb1 Ba6 (free at last!) 18.Bd3 Qb7 19.h4 Rc8 20.b3 Bxd3 21.Rxd3 ( after 21.cxd3 Na6 22.d4 , White prevents ...Nac5 but I slightly prefer Black's chances on the queenside over White's on the opposite wing after 22...Nc7 since ...Nb5 follows ) 21...Na6 22.Qg4 Qc6 23.Rc1 Nc7 (intending ...Nb5, which clamps down on c3 and menaces a3) 24.c3 (otherwise White won't get a chance to play this freeing move if Black achieves ...Nb5) 24...Nb5! 25.cxb4? ( necessary is 25.Qd1 bxc3 26.Nxc3 Nxc3+ 27.Rdxc3 Qxc3 28.Rxc3 Rxc3 29.Qd2 Rc7 when Black looks slightly better ) 25...Qa6! (Black threatens ...Na3+ and thus regains the lost pawn) 26.Qe2 axb4 27.Rd2? Na3+ 28.Kb2 Nc4+! 29.bxc4 Qxa4 30.Kb1 b3 with a winning attack, S.Solovjov-O.Nikolenko, St Petersburg 2004.

**15...Ba6 16.h5 Qc7 17.h6 g6 18.Kb1 Bxf1 19.Rhxf1 f5?!**

One of the most agonizing choices a French Defence player must make is when to play ...f6 or ...f5 and when to hold back. Black takes pre-emptive action on the kingside, which he hopes will keep his king safer.

The untested 19...Rfc8! is unambitious but I had difficulty making progress for White after 20.g4 Ne7 21.Rg1 Qc6 22.b3 Kf8! cutting out White's intended f5 break. Following 23.Bd4 Rc7 24.Rg2 Rb8 25.Qh4 Rbc8 , I don't see how White can make progress. This plan of "marking time" looks clearly superior to the over-eager 19...f5?!. As Tartakower once said: "the strategist must know what to do when nothing needs doing."

**20.Rc1?!**

There is a fine distinction between the difficult and the impossible. It feels that White's failure to capture en passant allows his attack to veer in the territory of the latter category. Now White's intended attack expends itself fruitlessly, without achieving its objective. Now Black's king remains quite safe.

QUESTION: Wouldn't it be in White's best interest to open the kingside and turn the e6-pawn into a potential target with 20.exf6 ? --- ANSWER: I believe so. In this case, White's attacking chances and play on the e6-weakness override Black's play down the f-file. For example, after 20...Nxf6 21.Qh4 Ne4 22.Nc5 Nxc5 23.Bxc5 Rf5 as in J.Riff-S.Feller, Guingamp 2010, the players agreed to a draw here. Houdini assesses at a tiny plus for White. Let's continue the analysis to determine if its assessment is accurate: 24.Qf2 Ne5 ( 24...Rc8 25.g4 Rf7 26.Rde1 Nd8 27.Bb6 Qc4 28.b3 Qb5 29.f5 with a strong attack ) 25.Qe3 Qf7 26.Qe2 Nc4 27.g4 Rf6 28.Bd4 Re8 29.b3 e5 30.Bxe5 Rxe5 31.fxe5 Rxf1 32.bxc4! ( 32.Rxf1?? is met with the dirty trick 32...Qxf1+! 33.Qxf1 Nd2+ ) 32...Rxd1+ 33.Qxd1 dxc4 34.Qd8+ Qf8 35.Qxa5 Qf1+ 36.Kb2 c3+ 37.Kb3 Qb1+ 38.Kc4 Qxc2 39.Qd8+ Kf7 40.Qd7+ Kf8 41.e6 and White dodges the perpetual check and goes on to win. So it looks like your suggested 20 exf6! is White's strongest plan.

**20...Qb7 21.Rfd1**

Plans based on g2-g4 don't work out well for White since Black simply plays ...fxg4 which clears the f5-square for his pieces and turns the f4-pawn into a potential target.

**21...Rac8 22.Rd3 Nd8 23.b3 Nf7**

White's advanced h-pawn may become a target if queens are removed from the board.

**24.Qh4 Rc6 25.Bd4**

White decides to put his destiny to the test with a plan of complete passivity. It may seem counter-intuitive, but perhaps White should consider c3, just to give his king air and avoid getting tied down on c2, as what happened in the game. The fact is White shouldn't temporize forever.

Houdini's analysis led to a draw after 25.c3! . --- A pragmatist's spirit is not one which soars readily on command. This is a psychologically tough move to make since it does weaken White's king, yet the surrounding counterplay associated with it overrides safety concerns. 25...bxc3 26.Qe7 Qb4! 27.Qxd7 Qe4 28.Qxc6 Qxd3+ 29.Rc2 Qxe3 30.Rxc3 Qe4+ 31.Kb2 Qxg2+ 32.Rc2 Qf1 33.Nc5 Qxf4 34.Nd7 Qd4+ 35.Rc3 Rd8 36.Qxe6 Qd2+ 37.Rc2 Qd4+ with perpetual check.

**25...Rfc8 26.Rd2 R8c7 27.g3**

Note how Black's lack of control over his kingside dark squares isn't disastrous since his knights cover all key weak points.

**27...Qc8 28.Qh2**

The queen departs with offended dignity.

Nothing comes of infiltration with 28.Qe7? Nxh6 and if 29.Rh2?? Nxe5 wins.

**28...Qf8!**

Stellwagen constantly reminds his opponent of the needy h6-outpost, which sticks out like a sore thumb.

**29.Rh1 Nd8 30.Qh4 Nb7 31.Rhh2 Rc8 32.Rd3 R8c7 33.Rdd2 Nb8 34.Rh1 Na6 35.Qh2**

EXERCISE (planning): Both players seem to be hovering in an eternal holding pattern and the position looks even. This is a deception. If you find the correct plan for Black, he wrests a clear advantage. What is it? --- ANSWER: Removal of the minor pieces allows Black's attack to push forward, while White's is stalled.

**35...Nac5!**

At long last we sense motion. Not much... just a mild breeze rustling leaves, but still, motion.

**36.Nxc5 Nxc5 37.Bxc5**

White can't allow that knight to reach e4.

**37...Rxc5 38.Qf2**

Fear for our king's safety tends to act as a sedative to our attacking ambitions.

38.Qh4 , hoping to keep Black tied down doesn't help as after 38...a4 39.Rhd1 Qc8 40.Qh2 axb3 41.cxb3 Rc1+ 42.Kb2 Qa6! , Black gets a winning attack.

**38...Qc8 39.Rh2 a4!**

Stellwagen plays the attack with a welder's eye for the strongest and weakest points as well as the knowledge of how much stress can be withstood (without violating integrity). This move weakens b4 but the attacking chances gained are more pertinent.

**40.Qd4?**

After this mistake, the queenside becomes a morgue for White's defensive ambitions.

His last chance is to curl up with 40.Rd3! Qa8 41.Qd4 axb3 42.Rxb3 Rc4 43.Qb2 Qa7 44.Re2 Qc5 45.Rd2 when progress isn't so easy and Black may have to take on some risk to play for the win.

**40...axb3 41.axb3 Qa6 42.Qxb4 Ra7!**

Multiple attackers array themselves before White's king, with dual mating threats on a1 and f1.

**43.Qd4**

EXERCISE (combination alert): The white king's defenders rally around him - or so they believe. It seems everything is under control, since a1 is covered and an f1 check is met with Rd1. The reality is that Black has been handed a combination on a plate, with a parsley garnish around it. Find a method to throw the defence off-kilter. --- ANSWER: Interference. Three black attackers congeal into a single vision of unified intent.

**43...Rc3!**

After this move, the twin blisters on a1 and f1 serve as painful reminders to White of his state of helplessness. The rook threads his way through heavy middlegame traffic, blocking White's defensive lanes. Mate is threatened on a1 and the scheming black rook's deviousness would bring a smile of admiration to Prince Machiavelli's lips.

After 43...Rc3! 44.Qxc3 Qf1+ 45.Kb2 Qa1# delivers mate - "You have outlived your usefulness," the queen reminds the king. --- SUMMARY: One of the most difficult decisions for a French player is when to play ...f6 or ...f5, and when to hold back.

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Bc5 9.Qd2 O-O 10.O-O-O a6 11.Qf2 Bxd4 12.Bxd4 b5 13.Be3 b4 14.Na4 a5 15.h4 Ba6 16.Bxa6**

QUESTION: In the previous game, White played 16 h5. Why did White give Black a free rook-lift to a6 in this case? --- ANSWER: White blinks first and swaps on a6, mainly because he doesn't believe either of his rooks belong on f1.

**16...Rxa6 17.h5 Ne7**

QUESTION: Why retreat? --- ANSWER: Dual purpose: 1. The knight clears c6 for Black's rook, preparing to treble major pieces down the c-file. --- 2. The e7-knight keeps an eye on White's f5-break.

After 17...Qc7 18.h6 g6 19.Nc5 Nxc5 20.Bxc5 Rc8 21.Qh4 f5! : ( 22.exf6?? Nd8! wins material, since White's bishop is unable to move due to the mate threat on c2. White's attempted attack fails after 23.f7+ Nxf7 24.Qf6 Nxh6 25.Rxh6 Qxc5 26.Rxg6+ hxg6 27.Qxg6+ Kf8 28.Rh1 Qd4! and White's attack is at an end. ) ( 22.Bd6 Qd8 23.Qh3 Ne7 24.Qh4 Nc6 25.Qh3 Ra7 26.g4!? Rf7 27.Rhg1 Kh8 28.gxf5 Rxf5 and I prefer Black, whose structural gains are real, unlike White's vague attacking chances. The f4-pawn is perpetually weak and Black owns the key f5-square, J.Hammer-B.Socko, Tromso 2007. ( ) )

**18.Nc5 Rc6 19.g4 f5!**

Well timed. Principle: Counter in the centre when menaced on the wing.

**20.g5?!**

What transforms a pleasant dream into a nightmare? In this case, the answer is inaction. White's initiative goes dormant after this move and just like the last game, the passivity strategy falls short of expectations. After this optimistic gesture of goodwill, White experiences nasty vicissitudes of fortune, mainly because he runs out of active ideas. --- QUESTION: Why would White gum up his kingside attack like this when he can take f6 en passant?

ANSWER: Just like in the last game, White should take on f6 if given the chance, despite Black's activity spike after doing so. The position looks unclear after 20.exf6 Nxf6 21.Qe2 Qd6 22.Rhe1 Rfc8 23.Kb1 a4! ( 23...Rxc5!? 24.Bxc5 Rxc5 25.g5 Nd7 26.Qxe6+ Qxe6 27.Rxe6 Nf5 is a tough ending to assess. Houdini rates the position at about even. I don't think Black's knights perform especially well here and I would actually rather take White's game if given a choice ) 24.Bd4 Rxc5 25.Bxc5 Qxc5 26.Qxe6+ Kf8 27.h6 Qxc2+ 28.Ka1 Nfg8 29.hxg7+ Kxg7 30.Qd6 Qc5 31.Qe5+ Kf8 32.f5 a3 33.g5 d4 34.Qxc5 Rxc5 with a messy ending, rated dead even by the comps.

**20...Nxc5 21.Bxc5 Qd7 22.Rd2 Rfc8**

I prefer Black since his king appears quite safe while the white king's safety remains in question.

**23.Bd6 Rc4 24.b3 Rc3 25.Kb1**

25.Qb6 Qc6! forces queens off the board, with a favourable ending.

**25...Qb7 26.Bxe7**

QUESTION: Why did White give up his bishop for Black's passive knight?

ANSWER: The knight wasn't going to be passive for long, since he had access to the following plans: 1. Black can contemplate transferring the knight to b5 via c6 and a7, where it would menace ...Na3+. --- 2. Black can play ...a4 and then transfer the knight to a5 via c6, where it would threaten sacs on both b3 and c4. For example, after 26.g6 h6 27.Rhd1 a4 28.Qe2 Nc6 29.Rd3 axb3 30.cxb3 Na5 , I would be getting awfully nervous here with the white pieces.

**26...Qxe7 27.g6 h6**

Now Black's king can rest easy. Still, Black must be watchful of back rank shots later on.

**28.Qb6 R3c6! 29.Qd4**

QUESTION: Was a5 poisoned? --- ANSWER: It sure was.

29.Qxa5?? is met with 29...Qb7 30.a3 bxa3 31.Qxa3 Ra8 32.Qb2 Qa7 33.Rhd1 ( 33.c3 is countered with 33...Ra6 ) 33...Ra6 34.Qd4 Ra1+ 35.Kb2 Qa2+ 36.Kc3 Rc8+ 37.Kd3 Rxd1 and the deflection of c2's defender is decisive.

**29...a4!**

A sinister form appears in the horizon. Black's major pieces, in conjunction with the a- and b-pawns, huddle together ominously in conference on the most efficient method of eliminating White's king.

**30.Rh3 Qc7 31.Qf2**

White remains tied down by the c2-burden.

**31...Qa5**

Black keeps his opponent worried about infiltrations down both c- and a-files.

**32.Qe1 Ra8 33.Qf2 Rc5 34.Qd4 axb3 35.cxb3**

35.axb3?? is a helpmate after 35...Rc3 .

**35...Rac8**

Threat: Mate in two.

**36.Rh1 Qc7 37.Qg1!**

It's important for White to keep an eye out for ...d4 as well. For example: 37.Qb2? Rc3 38.Ka1 Qb6 39.Re1 Qd8 (threatening...Qh4 in order to go after the kingside pawns. If 40.Rh1 d4! is strong as the passed d-pawn is a free agent, with no blockader having dominion over it. 41.Rhd1 d3 leaves White in an absolutely paralyzing bind. "There are traitors in our midst," declares White's king, who states the obvious.

**37...Rc3 38.Qd1**

Everyone recognizes the tell-tale signs of a major pout coming on, when the white queen's overhanging lower lip begins to quiver with indignation over her new, subservient role in life. --- EXERCISE (planning): How does Black improve his already impressive position? --- ANSWER: Transfer the king to the queenside. The attackers plan to form a quorum on the queenside and get down to the business of hunting down White's king. --- QUESTION: What would be the point of doing this action? --- ANSWER: If some or all of the major pieces come off the board, Black achieves a winning ending - but only with the help of his king, which is transferred to the queenside. Oddly enough, White can't do much about this plan and can only watch helplessly as he sees his future slipping by.

**38...Kf8! 39.Re1 Ke7 40.Rh1 Qc5 41.Re1 Kd7 42.Kb2 Kc6! 43.Kb1 Kb6 44.Rd4 Rc7 45.Rd2 Ka5 46.Rh2 Rg3**

At last, Black infiltrates with his rook and clears c3 for his other pieces.

**47.Qd2 Kb6 48.Qd1**

White can't afford a queen swap, since it merely trades one oppressive problem for another.

After 48.Rd1 Rf3 49.Rg2 Qc3 50.Rf2 Qxd2 51.Rdxd2 Rh3 52.Rh2 Rcc3 53.Kb2 Rxh2 54.Rxh2 d4! ( this is even stronger than 54...Rf3 55.Rc2 ) 55.a3 bxa3+ 56.Kxa3 Kc5 57.Rd2 d3 58.Rh2 Kd4 59.Ka4 Rc2 60.Rh1 d2 , Black wins since his passer appears a wee bit faster than the non-starter on b3.

**48...Qc3 49.Rd2 Rh3 50.Ree2**

EXERCISE (planning): Sorrow's great torment is remembrance of past happiness. I bet White at this stage regretted his decision to lock the kingside. A list of White's troubles, in ascending order of importance: 1. White's position is unable to withstand a two-pronged assault. Black's major pieces managed to infiltrate and the h5 and f4 weaknesses cry out for attention, the way a toddler throws a tantrum when her mother walks by the mall's toy store without entering it. --- 2. Black's passed d-pawn, along with his advanced king, insure that rook endings or king and pawn endings will be lost for White, should a few pieces be removed from the board. --- 3. White can't do anything but wait. Such low-intensity attacks can actually be more potent than wild binges, mainly because prolonged defence has a way of enticing the defender to lower his or her guard, due to underestimation of the attack's true potential. White to play and win. --- ANSWER: Simplification. The threat of ...Rh1 forces queens off the board, leading to a hopeless rook ending for White.

**50...Qf3!**

It's easy to get enticed into the false path with 50...Rxh5?? which throws away the initiative for a worthless pawn. After 51.Rc2! Qf3 52.Qd4+ , it is Black who is forced to resign.

**51.Rd4 Rh1! 52.Re1**

52.Rxb4+?? Kc5! wins on the spot. White's multiple hanging pieces, shorn of protection, scan the horizon for reinforcements which will never arrive, the way shipwrecked sailors watch for passing sails.

**52...Qxd1+ 53.Rexd1 Rxd1+ 54.Rxd1 Rc3**

Black's rook infiltrates and the game is over.

**55.Kb2**

QUESTION: Can White save himself by entering a king and pawn ending after 55.Rc1 Rxc1+ 56.Kxc1 ? --- ANSWER: Black wins by a tempo after 56...Kc5 57.Kb2 Kd4 58.a4 bxa3+ 59.Kxa3 . The nervous, perspiring white king twiddles his fingers, plays with his shirt buttons and slowly slides away to the nearest exit. 59...Kc3 60.b4 d4 61.b5 d3 62.b6 d2 63.b7 d1=Q 64.b8=Q and 64...Qa1# is mate! "Who is this unpleasant, negligible pretender, who dares challenge his betters?" asks Black's queen of her brother. White's king can only respond by exhaling a melancholy sigh, reminiscing the good old days when he still commanded respect.

**55...Rh3 56.Rd4**

56.Rc1 is way too slow for White after 56...Rxh5 57.Rc8 Rh2+ 58.Kb1 Rg2 and Black wins.

**56...Kc5 57.Rd1 Rh2+**

57...Rh2+ 58.Kb1 d4 59.Rc1+ Kd5 60.Rc7 d3 61.Rxg7 Rh1+ 62.Kb2 Kc6! and the advanced d-pawn will cost White a rook. --- SUMMARY: If you induce White into locking up the kingside, you have excellent chances of bagging your opponent's king on the still fluid queenside.

### (20)Anand, V.   --   Morozevich, A. 7: FIDE World Championships, San Luis  2005   1/2-1/2   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Bc5 9.Qd2 O-O 10.O-O-O a6 11.Nb3**

QUESTION: Why would White voluntarily withdraw a centralized piece? --- ANSWER: White's move is based on two points: 1. Principle: The side with more space should avoid exchanges. Black isn't going to be tempted to swap away his good bishop for the e3-counterpart. --- 2. White fights for control over the key c5-square, denying Black ...Nc5 attacking ideas later. Let's not underestimate it, since this line is one of White's highest scoring in the Classical French. However, the move costs White time, which is a clear factor in opposing wing attacks.

**11...Bb4**

Black logically seeks to induce a weakening a2-a3 move.

Alternatives: 11...b6!? 12.Ne2 a5 13.Ned4 Nxd4 14.Nxd4 Ba6 (this bad bishop has a way of sneaking out every time) 15.Kb1 Qc7 16.Bd3 a4 17.Qe2 Bxd3 18.cxd3 b5! and Black's queenside play was well underway. He managed to swap away his light-squared bishop with balanced chances, F.Nijboer-D.Stellwagen, Wijk aan Zee 2003. --- QUESTION: Can White get away with grabbing b5? --- ANSWER: Let's take a look: 19.Nxb5 Qb6 20.Bxc5 Nxc5 21.Na3 (to prevent further erosion of the king's cover after ...a3) 21...Rfb8 (the threat is ...Qb4! menacing the a3-knight and f4-pawn) 22.Ka1 Na6 23.Rc1 Rb7 24.Rc3 Rab8 25.Rb1 and Houdini assesses this as absolutely equal, with full compensation for the pawn since White is completely tied down.

11...Bxe3 (this swap of dark-squared bishops generally favours White in the Classical, but it does follow the principle: The cramped side should swap pieces) 12.Qxe3 b5 13.Bd3 b4 14.Ne4 (a clever idea, but Moro just ignores the knight) 14...a5 15.Nbc5 Nxc5 16.Qxc5 Ne7 , A.Fier-A.Morozevich, Khanty-Mansiysk 2011. 17.Nd6 is met with 17...Ba6 18.Rhf1 Nc8 and the intruder is challenged. Black looks fine.

**12.Bd3 b5 13.Rhf1!?**

QUESTION: Doesn't White normally play h4 and Rh3 to activate the rook? --- ANSWER: Correct. In this case, Anand plans to lift the rook to h3 where it eyes the black kingside without being obstructed by the h4-pawn.

White can also try 13.g4 Na5 14.Bd4 Nc4 15.Qf2 a5! . Don't hesitate to give up your b-pawn in such situations and trust in the compensation of your open b-file. After 16.a3 Be7 17.Nxb5 (Black may as well bite the bullet since declining the pawn allows Black to attack for free after a coming ...b4) 17...Ba6 18.Nc3 Qc7 19.Bxc4 Bxc4 20.Nd2 Rab8 ( I would actually consider preserving the bad bishop with 20...Ba6 since this prevents future Rd3 defensive lifts ) 21.Nxc4 Qxc4 22.Qe2 Qc6 23.Rd3 Rfc8 24.Rf1 Bc5! 25.Nd1 , T.Gharamian-Ni Hua, Biel 2011, Black's attack more than compensates for the missing pawn after 25...Bxd4 26.Rxd4 Qb6 27.Rd3 Rc4 28.Rff3 Nc5 29.Rc3 Rd4 when ...Ne4 is in the air.

**13...Nb6!**

Multipurpose: 1. Black menaces ...Nc4. If White captures it there, the b-file is opened after ...bxc4. However, leaving the knight be on c4 isn't a picnic either for White since the advanced knight eyes tempting targets on b2, d2 and e3. --- 2 ...Na4 is in the air, adding pressure to c3. --- 3. Black may contemplate retreating his b4 bishop and following up with ...b4, after which White's attacked c3-knight is denied a Na4 option.

**14.a3!?**

This move provides Black with a tempting, future ...b4 prying mechanism.

The alternative is to go for a dark-square blockade plan with 14.Qf2 Nc4 15.Bxc4 bxc4 16.Nd4 Ne7 , G.Cabrilo-E.Bareev, Belgrade 1988. Both sides proceed with their respective attacks. Houdini's analysis runs 17.Nce2 Bd7 18.c3 Bc5 19.Rd2 Rb8 20.g4 Qb6 21.f5 f6! 22.exf6 Rxf6 23.g5 Rf7 24.f6 e5 25.Nf5 Bxe3 26.Nxe3 Bh3 27.Rg1 Be6 and Black stands better due to a powerful centre, the open b-file and the potential for White to overextend on the kingside light squares.

**14...Be7 15.Nd4**

No one has tried 15.Qf2 Nc4 16.Bc5 Bxc5 17.Qxc5 Bd7 18.Rf3 Rc8 19.Qf2 b4 20.axb4 Nxb4 when Black's attack looks at least as fast as White's since White can't get away with Bxh7+.

**15...Qc7**

Theory pretty much ends here.

Morozevich's move looks superior to 15...Nxd4 16.Bxd4 Nc4 17.Bxc4 bxc4 18.g4 f5 , G.Traut-W.Schubert, correspondence 2007. White looks slightly better after 19.exf6 Bxf6 20.Bxf6 Qxf6 21.f5 .

**16.Nxc6 Qxc6 17.Bd4**

17.f5 should be met with 17...f6! 18.fxe6 Bxe6 19.Bxb6 Qxb6 20.Bf5 Rad8 with even chances.

**17...Nc4**

This knight is the lead actor, indispensable to Black's overall goal.

**18.Qe2 Rb8 19.Bxh7+!?**

These opposite wing attacks, so common to Classical French, have a nasty way of raising our blood pressure to levels which our doctor wouldn't approve. The bishop, who normally displays a gift of hiding his true feelings, this time uncharacteristically refuses to keep up appearances and indulges in a tantrum. His philosophy on regicide undergoes a jarring modification, as he resolves to assassinate Black's king. In some situations we lay aside notions of multi-layered plans and just reach for a blunt instrument. So Anand decides to waive formalities and sacs. The black king's cover is soon ripped asunder as White's queen and two rooks make a mad dash at Black's seriously exposed king. However, the sac is only good enough to deliver perpetual check.

QUESTION: Rather than this mind over matter plan, can White attempt slower play with 19.Qh5 ? --- ANSWER: This move leads to head-spinning complications after 19...g6 20.Qh6 Re8 21.f5 Bf8 22.Qg5 exf5 23.e6! Rxe6 ( 23...Bxe6?? 24.Qf6 is curtains for Black's king after 24...Bh6+ 25.Kb1 Kf8 26.Bxf5! ) 24.Bxf5 Rd6 25.Bd3 b4 . Amazingly, Houdini worked matters out to a draw in the line 26.Bxc4 bxc3 27.Qe5 f6 28.Rxf6 Bh6+ 29.Kb1 Rxb2+ 30.Ka1 Rxf6 31.Bxd5+ Qxd5 32.Qxd5+ Be6 33.Qd8+ Rf8 34.Qd6 Ra2+ 35.Kb1 Rb2+ with perpetual check.

**19...Kxh7 20.Qh5+ Kg8 21.Rd3**

Attacking reinforcements arrive soon.

**21...f5**

All good defenders understand the art of orderly panic! Black's king desperately requires air.

**22.Rh3**

22.Rg3 Rb7! 23.Rxg7+ Kxg7 24.Rf3 Bh4! 25.Qxh4 Kf7 "...and the black king slips away to the centre with his booty of an extra rook" writes GM Neil McDonald. However, Houdini assesses this 0.00-dead even! Nothing but the passing of time can soften the effect of such an attack, and time is something Black utterly lacks. White may yet have full compensation even here. Analysis continues 26.b4 Ke8 27.Bc5 Rg7 28.Bxf8 Kxf8 29.Qf6+ Rf7 30.Qh6+ Ke8 31.Nxd5! Qxd5 32.Qh8+ Rf8 33.Qh5+ with perpetual check since Black's king is unable to cross over to the d-file.

**22...Bc5 23.Rff3!**

Anand gave up yet another piece for just a single tempo since the d4-bishop was unable to participate in the attack.

Chasing Black's king is a bad idea as 23.Qh7+? Kf7 24.Qh5+ Ke7 25.Qg5+ Kd7 26.Qxg7+ Be7 27.Rh7 Re8 28.g4 b4 29.axb4 Rxb4 30.gxf5 Nxb2! leads to a black win. For example, 31.f6 Rxd4 32.f7 Nd3+! 33.Kd2 Nxf4+ forces mate.

**23...Bxd4 24.Rfg3 Rb7!**

Moro lifts a much needed defender to cover g7.

**25.Qh7+ Kf7 26.Qxg7+**

We can't always win through force of will alone. Anand forces a perpetual since White is two pieces in the hole and there is no forced mate.

Black gets a lot for the queen in the line 26.Rxg7+ Ke8 27.Qg6+ Kd8 28.Qg5+ Ke8 . "When, oh when, will she cease inflicting her loathsome society upon me?" thinks Black's king. Black cannot shake White off as 29.Rhh7 Rxg7 30.Rxg7 Rf7 31.Rg8+ Rf8 32.Rg7 leads to yet another draw.

**26...Ke8**

EXERCISE (combination alert): The dazed black king reminds us of a citizen of Tokyo, just moments after Godzilla levelled the city. His hope for a discrete exit is foiled and a hidden combination cries for utterance. Delivery of checkmate is outside the scope of White's ragtag forces. How did Anand force the draw? --- ANSWER: Queen sac. The relationship comes to an abrupt end, in much the same way as Sid Vicious and Nancy's tempestuous relationship ended - in a murder/suicide.

**27.Qxf8+!**

Black has no way of evading perpetual check.

After 27.Qxf8+ Kxf8 28.Rh8+ Kf7 ( 28...Ke7?? this move does little to sooth the king's bruised ego and sorely tested patience. 29.Rg7# mate! The unfortunate king inadvertently steps within the rook's kill radius ) 29.Rh7+ and a truce is reached. --- SUMMARY: 11 Nb3 is based upon the following two points: 1. Principle: The side with more space should avoid exchanges (since Black isn't tempted to swap away his good bishop on e3). --- 2. White fights for control over the key c5-square, denying Black ...Nc5 attacking ideas later.

### (21)Kuipers, S.   --   Vallejo Pons, F. 8: German League  2012   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3 a6 8.Qd2 cxd4 9.Nxd4 Bc5 10.O-O-O O-O 11.Kb1**

QUESTION: Can White afford such a leisurely defensive move in an opposite wing attacks situation? --- ANSWER: It isn't really a loss of a tempo. If you look back on the previous games of this chapter, White tossed in Kb1 at some point or another in the majority of the games. By playing it early, White plays a useful defensive move and seeks to keep options open, while gathering intelligence on how Black plans to structure his operations.

**11...Bxd4**

Once again Black opts for the plan of handing over the bishop pair and control over dark squares, in exchange for time - a valuable commodity in opposite wing attacks.

The alternative trade 11...Nxd4 12.Bxd4 b5 13.Qe3 Qb6 14.Bxc5 Nxc5 the ending is quite playable. ( White gets a microbe of an edge due to superior bishop and control over d4 after 14...Qxc5 15.Qxc5 Nxc5 16.Rd4 Ra7 17.Be2 Bd7 18.a3 Rc8 19.h4 Rac7 20.h5 h6 21.g4 , S.Karachurin-V.Leupold, correspondence 2008 ) 15.Bd3 Na4 ( 15...b4 16.Ne2 a5 17.f5 exf5 18.Nf4 Qc6 19.Bb5 Qxb5 20.Rxd5 Bb7 21.Rxc5 Qb6 with equal chances ) 16.Qxb6 Nxb6 17.Rhe1 b4 18.Ne2 a5 19.Nd4 Ba6 allows Black to rid himself of his bad bishop and he should stand equal in the ending, Z.Efimenko-A.Rychagov, Dagomys 2009.

**12.Bxd4 b5 13.h4**

QUESTION: Wouldn't it be more logical for White to hang on to his bishop with 13.Bf2 ? --- ANSWER: Your suggestion is playable but risky, since a tempo can mean the difference between winning and losing in such sharp positions. For example, Black must not hesitate to ditch material after 13...Bb7 14.Bd3 Qc7 15.Qe3 !? ( I would go for the standard attacking plan 15.h4 Ne7 16.Rh3 ) 15...Nb4 16.Qh3 Nxd3 17.cxd3 b4 18.Ne2 d4!? (a sound investment, sac'ing a pawn to clear d5 for a piece) 19.Rc1 Qa5 20.Nxd4 , D.Rivera Kuzawka-V.Moskalenko, Caldas de Reis 1992 and Black appears to achieve full compensation after 20...Rac8 with the intention of ...Bd5.

**13...b4 14.Na4**

As mentioned earlier in the chapter, this is the preferable square for White's knight. The knight foray slows Black's queenside pawn avalanche as well as covers the key c5 and b6-squares.

If instead 14.Ne2 a5 15.Be3 Ba6 16.Nd4 Nxd4 17.Bxd4 Bxf1 18.Rdxf1 Rc8 19.f5 exf5 20.Rxf5 Nc5 21.Bxc5 (the knight can't be allowed to reach e4 or e6) 21...Rxc5 , a balanced position is reached, E.Shaposhnikov-A.Iljushin, St Petersburg 1999.

**14...Nxd4**

14...Qa5 15.b3 Nxd4 16.Qxd4 transposes to the game.

**15.Qxd4 Qa5 16.b3 Bb7**

The bad bishop prepares to make a pest of himself via c6 and b5.

**17.Rh3**

Alternatively, 17.h5 Bc6 18.Nb2 Bb5 19.Bd3 Rac8 20.f5 Bxd3 21.cxd3 exf5 22.h6 Qc5 23.Qxc5 Nxc5 24.hxg7 Rfe8 25.Rh5 Ne6 26.Rdh1 was played in I.Gaponenko-M.Chiburdanidze, Vrnjacka Banja 1996. The ending is equal after 26...Nd4 27.Rxh7 Ne2 28.d4 Rc1+! 29.Rxc1 Kxh7 .

**17...Bc6 18.Nb2**

QUESTION: What happens if White ignores the threat on a4 and sacs to continue the attack with 18.h5 Bxa4 19.h6 ? --- ANSWER: The sac looks unsound. Black should be winning after 19...g6! 20.bxa4 Nc5 when White is just busted, since Black threatens ...Nxa3 and ...Nc3+ where he nets material and retains the attack whereas White does not possess a trace of compensation.

**18...Bb5**

Our standard "ugly-duckling turns into swan" process is completed.

**19.Bd3 Rfc8**

QUESTION: Is this the correct rook? --- ANSWER: I'm not sure.

My intuition would go with 19...Rac8 to keep ...f6 options open. 20.Bxb5 Qxb5 21.Nd3 a5 22.Rd2 Nc5 23.Nxc5 Rxc5 24.Rf3 occurred in N.Guliyev-S.Kindermann, Germany 2008. At this stage, I prefer Black after 24...a4 25.bxa4 ( 25.f5 axb3 26.axb3 exf5 27.Rxf5 Ra8 28.Kc1 Qc6 29.Kd1 h6 also looks better for Black ) 25...Qa5 26.f5 Rc4 27.Qf2 Ra8 28.fxe6 fxe6 29.Rf7 Rg4! 30.Qf3 Qxa4 (threatening mate) 31.Rf8+ Rxf8 32.Qxg4 Kh8 33.h5 h6 when Black has both the safer king and superior structure.

**20.Rc1**

This looks new.

20.Rg3 was played in R.Zunker-D.Thielen, Goch 1994. Black can continue 20...Bxd3 21.Nxd3 Nc5! 22.Nxc5 ( 22.Qxb4? Qxb4 23.Nxb4 Ne4 wins the exchange for a pawn ) 22...Rxc5 (threat: ...Rxc2!) 23.Rc1 ( 23.h5?? Rxc2! 24.Kxc2 Qxa2+ 25.Kd3 Qxb3+ 26.Ke2 Qxg3 and White can resign ) 23...Rac8 24.h5 Qa3 25.Qb2 Qa5 with equality.

**20...Nb8?!**

This is either the beginning of a complex plan, or an elaborate hoax! This move is based on the philosophy: Predictable routine offers us a sense of comfort in day to day life; predictability when in a state of war, however, allows our opponents clear hindsight of our intent. --- We all understand the spirit of revolution is to defy the ruling authority, yet such an embrace of circuitous logic doesn't work in a semi-open position. In this instance the interface of optimism and reality fails to harmonize the way Black wishes it would. This is not the time to waffle from one plan to the next and he could do without this embellishment. Black seeks to redeploy his knight to c6 at a fearful cost of time.

The simple 20...Nc5 provides Black with a dynamically balanced game after 21.f5 Bxd3 22.Nxd3 ( 22.cxd3 Nd7 23.Rhh1 exf5 24.h5 h6 25.Qf4 Nc5 26.Qxf5 Rc7 is at least equal for Black ) 22...Ne4! 23.Nxb4 Rab8 24.c3 Qb5 and Black's two open attacking lanes offer loads of compensation for the pawn after the coming ...a5.

**21.f5 Nc6 22.Qf4 Qc7**

White stands a shade better after 22...Bxd3 23.Nxd3 exf5 24.h5 Qc7 25.g4! fxg4 26.Rg3 f6 27.exf6 Qxf4 28.Nxf4 .

**23.Re3?!**

White stands better in the ending after 23.c4! bxc3 24.Bxb5 c2+ 25.Rxc2 axb5 26.Rhc3 Qa7 27.a4 Ne7 28.fxe6 fxe6 29.Rxc8+ Rxc8 30.Rxc8+ Nxc8 31.axb5 .

**23...f6!**

This pinning, central counter allows Black to fight for a central initiative.

**24.Qg4?**

Houdini works out an equal ending in the complex line 24.fxe6 fxe5 25.Qf5 Bxd3 26.Nxd3 e4 27.Nf4 Rf8 28.Nxd5 Rxf5 29.Nxc7 Rc8 30.c3! Rxc7 31.cxb4 Re5 32.Rec3 Rxe6 33.a4 e3 34.b5 e2 35.Re1 Rd7 36.bxc6 Rd1+ 37.Rc1 Rxc1+ 38.Kxc1 Rxc6+ 39.Kd2 Rb6 40.Rxe2 Rxb3 41.Re6 Rg3 .

**24...Nxe5 25.Qxb4 Nxd3 26.Nxd3 e5**

Black emerged from the complications with a clear advantage. This is due to his: 1) Powerful, unchallenged centre. --- 2) Better remaining minor piece. --- 3) Superior attacking chances.

**27.Nb2**

This looks passive. White is not given time for the intended c4-break.

He should at least make a go of an attack with 27.g4 .

**27...d4 28.Rh3 Be2!**

Preventing g4 and threatening ...Bg4.

**29.Rg3?!**

White loses the thread and his setbacks transpire with greater frequency and also greater intensity as time passes.

Necessary was 29.Rhh1 Bg4 30.Rhf1 .

**29...e4!**

Uncovering an attack on g3 and further mobilizing the impressive centre pawns.

**30.Qe1 Re8**

The bishop isn't hanging, as long as White's rook remains on g3.

**31.c3?!**

I don't quite understand the point of allowing Black a second, deeply entrenched passed pawn. When our clocks run low, irrationality has an irritating way of asserting itself into our decision-making process. With such a move comes the implication of a dire emergency, bordering on desperation.

White had to try 31.Rxg7+ Kxg7 32.Qxe2 Qf4 33.g4 and pray for a swindle.

**31...d3 32.Nc4**

32.Re3 Qf4 33.Rxe2 dxe2 34.Qxe2 Qxf5 is hopeless as well.

**32...a5**

Black engages excavating machinery to forcibly dig White's king out from his hole.

**33.Re3 a4 34.Kb2**

The king pretends that everything is just fine, a strained nonchalance, but to no avail.

**34...axb3 35.axb3**

EXERCISE (combination alert): The irradiated queenside swiftly grows uninhabitable for humans as Black's attack rages on without even a pause for a comma or even a semi-colon. Time to pierce the veil of the white king's evasions with a killing shot. Do you see it?

**35...Qa7**

A tithe isn't so great if you had your heart set on 100% of the take. However, this sequel also wins. Black's preoccupation with the newly opened a-file distracts him from finding a even more crushing option.

ANSWER: The queen sac 35...Qxc4! speeds up White's demise. What's worse is White can't accept the proffered queen. Having had her romantic advances rejected by White's king, the queen believes the best way to mend her shattered heart is to execute him. 36.Rxe2 ( 36.bxc4 Reb8# is mate and the extraction of humour from one's misfortunes is thin consolation for the actual pain we undergo ) 36...Reb8 ends it.

**36.Ra1**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Round two. Find the hidden catalyst to Black's attack. --- ANSWER: Overload.

**36...d2!**

It is an exercise in futility to continue 36...d2! 37.Qg1 Qxa1+ 38.Qxa1 Rxa1 39.Nxd2 Rea8! and 40.Rxe2 R8a2# is mate! --- SUMMARY: 11 Kb1 is a temporizing move where White makes a useful defensive move while waiting to see how we set up our battle formation.

0-1

### (22)2: The Shirov-Anand Line   --   ? ? ????   \* (Cyrus Lakdawala)

FEN: r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P1P2/2P5/PP2N1PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1

The Shirov-Anand Line is perhaps White's most ambitious line in the Classical French. In this case, White's build-up hardly forms the image of an intimidating attacker. Instead, our opponents opt for a slow squeeze, openly violating principle by swinging the c3-knight to e2 to erect a gigantic pawn centre. Of course, in doing so, they contort, clog and fall behind in development. As Black, we don't have the luxury of indulging in the revenge-is-yummier-when-served-chilled philosophy. If we don't react with immediate violence, we risk slow asphyxiation.

Our problem is, ...cxd4 is met with cxd4, and ...f6 and ...fxe5 is met with fxe5, which fails to mutilate White's centre and we remain cramped. We must throw off the banner of caution, avoid our standoffish ways and employ our developmental lead to shake things up. This often culminates in a piece sac on e5, or an exchange sac on f3, as seen in the book's introductory game, cunningly masquerading as a desperado.

### (23)Lupulescu, C.   --   Smerdon, D. 9: Chess Olympiad, Calvia  2004   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3**

Tarrasch French: 3.Nd2 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.c3 Nc6 7.Ndf3 Qb6 8.g3 f6 9.Ne2 .

**3...Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.Nce2**

QUESTION: Why is this variation called the Shirov-Anand Line? --- ANSWER: This idea was played by Anand in his 2000 FIDE World Championships match against Shirov in the fourth and final game (See Game 11). Anand won the match 3.5-0.5, by the way. --- QUESTION: The move openly violates principles: 1. Don't move the same piece more than once in the opening. --- 2. Don't clog your development, which the knight clearly does on e2. --- Am I correct in this assumption? --- ANSWER: It's no easy task to examine a situation from the opponent's point of view, mainly since our own perspective tends to block out the horizon. You are correct, yet it's still a good move and White scores 55.1% with it - an average score for a white opening. The line is also played at the very highest levels, being a particular favourite of Anand, who has accumulated a devastating score with it as White. White's ideas behind the move: Unlike the first chapter, where Black undermines White's centre with ...c5, ...cxd4 and later ...f6, in the case of the Shirov-Anand Line, White intends to back up the gigantic centre with c3 and also f4, intending to recapture on d4 and e5 with pawns. This means White annexes massive territory, hoping to deny the opponent counterplay and essentially asphyxiate Black. Of course, there is a huge catch to White's dreams - the fact that White, while busily erecting the centre, wilfully neglects development. It is up to us to find a way to open the position early and exploit this factor. It is not enough to merely play ...c5, ...cxd4, ...f6 and ...fxe5. We must keep in mind the possibility of ...g5 and also look for exchange sacs on f3, not forgetting piece sac options on d4 and e5 to exploit our developmental lead.

**5...c5 6.c3**

For simplicity's sake, on 6.f4 , let's avoid the sideline 6...cxd4 ( and just continue 6...Nc6 which should simply transpose to the games in this chapter. )

**6...Nc6 7.f4 Qb6**

Black's main move in the position, where the queen adds firepower to both d4 and b2.

In the book, we won't be covering 7...cxd4

or 7...b5

and in the final game of the chapter, we will cover 7...Be7 .

**8.Nf3**

QUESTION: Wait a minute...this seems familiar. Doesn't this look like a French Tarrasch setup? --- ANSWER: Well done! The position may actually begin with a Classical move order, yet it transposes to a known variation of the Tarrasch French. Compare the position we get in the game, with this one, arising from Tarrasch French after 3 Nd2 Nf6 4 e5 Nfd7 5 f4 c5 6 c3 Nc6 7 Ndf3 Qb6 8 Ne2, reaching the same setup. So your eyes didn't deceive you (see the 3 Nd2 variation).

**8...f6**

A logical extension of our undermining project.

Later in the chapter, we will examine the lines 8...Be7

and 8...a5 .

**9.g3**

QUESTION: More time loss? --- ANSWER: White must find a way to develop the kingside, so he plans Bh3 to take aim at the newly weakened e6-square. GM Neil McDonald calls the move "extremely ambitious".

In the next two games of the chapter, we will look at 9.a3 .

**9...cxd4 10.cxd4**

10.Nexd4 is inconsistent with White's philosophy in the line, since it accords Black the possibility of dismantling the big centre. After 10...fxe5 11.fxe5 ( 11.Nxe6 Nf6 12.Nxf8 Bg4! 13.Ne6 Bxe6 14.Nxe5 O-O offers Black a massive developmental lead, which easily outweighs the lost pawn, K.Suwara-G.De Melo, correspondence 2007 ) 11...Nc5 12.Bh3 Be7 13.O-O O-O 14.Qe2 Nxd4 15.Nxd4 Rxf1+ 16.Kxf1 Bd7 17.Kg2 , Black managed to chip away at White's once imposing centre and also develop his pieces harmoniously, V.Atlas-T.Luther, Austria 2001.

**10...Bb4+!**

This move gains time, since blocking with the bishop doesn't work for White.

**11.Nc3**

Forced.

White has scored disastrously after 11.Bd2? . Following 11...fxe5 12.fxe5 O-O 13.Bg2 Ndxe5! 14.dxe5 Nxe5 (Black's latent mating threat on f2 makes this move possible) 15.Ned4? ( Houdini claims White's only prayer lies in the line 15.Bxb4 Qxb4+ 16.Kf2 Qe4 17.Nc3 Nd3+ 18.Kf1 Qc4 19.Qa4 Nb4+ 20.Ke1 e5 which looks pretty awful as well for White as his king is left bouncing around the middle of the board ) 15...Nc4 16.Bc3 e5 17.Nc2 , A,Finkel-F.Holzke, Groningen 1996, now crushing is 17...Nxb2! 18.Qd2 Bxc3 19.Qxc3 e4 .

11.Kf2?? This plays into our hands after 11...fxe5 12.fxe5 Ndxe5 with an extra pawn, a developmental lead and a winning position. Seven unfortunate players had fallen for this trap according to my database. Maybe one of our future opponents may volunteer to be unlucky number eight?

**11...O-O**

More accurate than 11...fxe5 12.fxe5 O-O since it allows White 13.Bf4 . Now Black went for it with 13...Ndxe5 14.Bxe5 Nxe5 15.Nxe5 Bxc3+ 16.bxc3 Qb2 (threatening mate on f2 and also the c3-pawn) 17.Qc1 Qf2+ 18.Kd1 Qxf1+ 19.Rxf1 Rxf1+ 20.Kd2 Rxc1 21.Rxc1 b6 22.Rf1 Rb8 23.Rf7 Rb7 24.Rxb7 Bxb7 and White's good knight versus Black's bad bishop saved the former in the pawn-down ending, R.Robson-G.Meier, Lubbock 2010.

**12.a3**

QUESTION: Can White relieve some of the central pressure by agreeing to a concession with 12.exf6 ? --- ANSWER: The move does reduce the central pressure for White, but it also helps Black unravel. Black gets excellent chances after 12...Nxf6 13.Be3?! , and now Black can utilize his developmental lead by blasting open the centre favourably with ( 13.a3 avoids Black's coming trick, T.Fogarasi-M.Guzijan, Budapest 1990 ) 13...e5! 14.Nxe5 Nxe5 15.fxe5 Bg4 16.Be2 Bxe2 17.Qxe2 Ne4 18.Rc1 Qa5 , thus threatens both the a2-pawn and the c3-knight. After 19.a3 Bxc3+ 20.bxc3 Rac8 , Black regains lost material. More pertinent is that he retains the dominant position with a continuing developmental lead, the superior minor piece and White's king is still stuck in the middle.

**12...Be7 13.Bh3 fxe5!?**

To agree to the decapitation of your central pawns is no minor matter. Yet generosity of such magnitude is a commonplace trait in our system. With our last move, we refuse to bother with defence of the e6-pawn and sign a war declaration, relying solely upon our considerable developmental lead.

Black doesn't have to sac as 13...Kh8 is also playable, with the idea that after 14.Na4 ( 14.Bxe6?! is met with 14...Ndxe5! 15.Bxd5 Nxf3+ 16.Bxf3 Nxd4 with a serious developmental lead for Black ) 14...Qc7 15.O-O Nb6 16.Nc3 Bd7 17.Kg2 f5 , chances look about even. Black continues to lead in development and will soon generate queenside counterplay, S.Grover-E.Danielian, Groningen 2009.

**14.Bxe6+**

White is not one to allow such a provocation to pass unchallenged.

**14...Kh8 15.Nxd5 Qd8 16.Bxd7**

This ensures us the bishop pair and domination of the light squares. --- QUESTION: I'm getting a bit concerned. We are dropping pawns left and right. Is Black still okay here?

ANSWER: Black's developmental lead continues to give him full compensation in every version. For example: 16.Nxe7 Qxe7 17.d5 e4 18.Ng5 Nc5 19.Bxc8 Nd3+ 20.Kf1 Raxc8 21.dxc6 Qxg5 22.cxb7 Rb8 23.Kg2 , A.Lukin-S.Ivanov, Soviet Union 1984. Here, Black has a powerful attack and initiative after 23...Qc5 .

16.dxe5 Ndxe5! 17.Nxe5 Bxe6 18.Nxe7 Qxe7 19.Nxc6 bxc6 20.O-O Bd5 and Black's powerful light-squared bishop (thanks to the favourable opposite-coloured bishops situation) comfortably makes up for the pawn deficit.

**16...Bxd7 17.dxe5**

17.Nxe7 Qxe7 18.dxe5 Rad8 19.Qd6 Qf7 (Black's developmental lead and light-square control easily override White's two extra pawns) 20.Qc5 Bg4 21.O-O Bxf3! and White actually resigned in J.Barlow-A.Gaujens, coorrepondence 2002 as after 22.Rxf3 Nd4 23.Re3 Qf5 24.Bd2 Nc2 25.Rd1 Nxe3 26.Qxe3 Qc2 27.Qe2 Rd4 28.e6 Rfd8 29.e7 Re8 , the situation is hopeless for White.

**17...Bg4**

Threat: 18...Nxe5!.<addx start="18...Nxe5"/>

**18.O-O Bc5+ 19.Be3 Bxe3+ 20.Nxe3 Qb6**

Attacking b2 and the pinned e3-knight.

**21.Qd2**

EXERCISE (combination alert): How did Black, currently down two pawns, pick up the exchange? --- ANSWER: Attraction/double attack.

**21...Bxf3! 22.Rxf3**

The rook is lured to the tactically unfavourable f3-square.

**22...Nd4**

Double attack on the f3-rook and the b3-fork square.

**23.Rff1**

GM Smagin suggests 23.Raf1 but now, rather than immediately taking the f3-rook, Black can play the zwischenzug 23...Rfd8 24.Qg2 Nxf3+ 25.Qxf3 Rd3 26.Re1 Qxb2 with advantage to Black.

**23...Nb3 24.Qe2?!**

A new move,

though inferior to the previously played 24.Qf2! Nxa1 25.Rxa1 Rae8! 26.Rc1 g5! 27.Ng4 Qxf2+ 28.Kxf2 gxf4 29.Rc7 fxg3+ 30.Kxg3 Rg8 31.Kf4? S.Smagin-V.Dimitrov, Prilep 1992. Now Black should play ( Correct was 31.Kf3 after which chances should have been even ) 31...Rc8! which forces White to swap his active rook, giving Black a winning ending.

**24...Nxa1 25.Rxa1 g5 !**

This thematic destabilizer of a move lowers the barrier to Black's overall goal and sends White the message "Your king is more exposed than mine." Normally two pawns for an exchange is plenty but not here, since White's king is more precariously placed than Black's and his e- and f-pawns will soon become unstable.

**26.Rf1 gxf4 27.gxf4 Rf5?**

I don't get this move as it appears to be an allusion to the correct idea, rather than the real thing. One senses that Black's confidence in his attack refuses to wane. His last move is a waste of time, after which the game becomes unclear.

Correct was 27...Rad8! , intending to destabilize White's centre further with ...Rd4 thus giving Black a clear advantage.

**28.Kh1!**

After this useful move, Black simply lost a tempo.

**28...Rf7 29.f5 Rg8 30.e6**

The pawns are deeply entrenched now.

**30...Rfg7**

Threat: ...Qc6+ to force mate.

**31.Qf3**

White fends off the mate and threatens to blast forward with f6.

**31...Rg5 32.b4**

32.f6?? doesn't cut it after 32...Qxe6 33.f7 Rf8 when the f7-pawn soon falls as well.

**32...Qd6 33.Nd5 Rg3!?**

"I wish I may, I wish I might, Have the wish I wish tonight," thinks the rook. White's indignation is quickly replaced by astonishment.

33...Rg2 forces a draw after 34.Nf4 Rc2 35.f6 Qd2 36.Ne2! Qxe2 37.Qxe2 Rxe2 38.e7 . This looks ominous but Black is equal to the task of containing White's promotion ambitions after 38...Re6 39.f7 Rxe7 40.fxg8=Q+ Kxg8 .

**34.Qd1**

Perhaps White is playing for the win.

34.hxg3 Rxg3 and we examine the following:

Most certainly not 35.Qe4?? as after 35...Rh3+ ("God save the king," whispers the anti-royalist, with a smile, as he reveals a dagger before White's king) 36.Kg2 Qh2# is mate!

Also fatal is 35.e7?? Qh6+ 36.Qh5 Qxh5# with mate once again.

35.Ne3! Rxf3 36.Rxf3 Kg8 and neither side can make progress and the position should be drawn.

**34...R3g4!**

Somehow the rook emerged from the fight with all his teeth intact. He sidesteps a would-be assailant with bored indifference, all the while setting up a sneaky mate threat. Black's move covers against Qd4+ and sets up ...Qxh2+! followed by ...Rh4 mate!

**35.Qf3?!**

White's game sours through irresolute play.

Correct was 35.Qd3! Qe5 36.Nf4! Rxf4 37.Rxf4 Qxf4 38.Qc3+ Rg7 39.Qc8+ Rg8 40.Qc3+ which ends in perpetual check.

**35...Qe5!**

Suddenly, White's pawns are in real danger.

**36.e7?**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Black can force the win here. How?

Also bad is 36.Ne3?? Re4 37.Ng2 Re2 38.Rf2 Qa1+ 39.Rf1 Qb2 40.Rg1 Rexg2! and Black wins.

White's last prayer is 36.Nf4! Qxf5 37.Qc3+ R4g7 38.Qd4 when he still retains chances to save the game.

**36...Rh4?**

This allows White back into the game. Missing a combination is like a judge telling a confessed serial killer: "The court leaves guilt or innocence to the dictates of the defendant's own conscience."

ANSWER: Black misses 36...Re4! which destabilizes White and forces him to come face to face with the magnitude of his error. If 37.f6 Re1! (threat: ...Rxf1+ followed by ...Qxd5+) 38.Nf4 Qe4! and White is helpless to defend against Black's multiple pin/overload threats.

**37.Nf4! Qxe7**

37...Qxf5?? 38.Qc3+ is mate in two moves.

**38.Qc3+ Qg7 39.f6 Qf7 40.Qe5**

White prays that his deeply passed f-pawn will hold the game.

**40...b6 41.b5 Rhg4!**

Setting up a deadly threat of a queen check on b7.

**42.h3**

42.Qf5?? Qb7+ 43.Nd5 R4g5 wins.

**42...Rg3 43.Kh2**

A mistake but White was busted anyway. --- EXERCISE (combination alert): A cloud of anxiety hangs over White's king. Black to play and win.

His best hope to resist was 43.Re1 though it would have been futile with careful play from Black.

**43...Qa2+**

ANSWER: Double attack/deflection. --- Quick as a shadow, the queen strikes. "A well-aimed arrow at my brother's heart will finally resolve our misunderstanding," thinks Black's queen.

**44.Ne2**

On 44.Kh1 , White's defences get punctured, as if with a pin cushion, with the deflection shot 44...Rxh3+ 45.Nxh3 Qg2# .

**44...Rg2+ 45.Kh1 Rxe2**

. SUMMARY: In the Shirov-Anand Line, we enter a classic battle between structure and dynamism. It is imperative to rely on our lead in development, even if we must keep sac'ing to maintain our initiative.

0-1

### (24)Baramidze, D.   --   Bartel, M. 10: German League  2012   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4**

QUESTION: Didn't you cover this in Chapter One? --- ANSWER: We can also reach the Shirov-Anand Line with this move order.

**5...c5 6.Nce2 Nc6**

QUESTION: Shouldn't we punish White for his failure to play c3 by playing 6...cxd4 ? --- ANSWER: It's playable but most GMs just stick to 6...Nc6, the move Bartel played in the game. After 6...cxd4, White retains absolute control over d4 after 7.Nxd4 Nc6 . Even though now Black threatens ...Ndxe5! followed by ...Qh4, every opponent in the universe is going to respond with White's next move, even if he or she doesn't spot the trap. After the natural 8.Ngf3 Nc5 9.Be3 Bd7 10.c3 Be7 11.Nb3 b6! 12.Be2 Nxb3 13.axb3 Bc5 14.Qd2 a5 15.O-O O-O 16.Bd3 Qe7 17.Kh1 f6 18.exf6 gxf6!? 19.Rae1 , White has a dynamic position where his attacking chances get the nod over Black's central potential, C.Bauer-M.Gurevich, Belfort 2003.

**7.c3 Qb6 8.Nf3 f6 9.a3**

White continues to follow his leisurely strategy, putting off development for later, with the belief that Black experiences difficulty in opening the game to exploit his developmental lead.

**9...Be7**

QUESTION: If we know White is planning to resolve central tension with b4, then why not prevent it with 9...a5 ? --- ANSWER: The move is playable but we actually don't mind White playing b4, since this allows us ...a5, undermining White's queenside. 10.g3 (White follows the game plan from the previous game in the chapter) 10...Be7 11.Bh3 Nf8 ( 11...f5 is exactly what White wants ) 12.exf6 Bxf6 occurred in A.Ivanov-A.Bykhovsky, New York 1990 when White can exert unpleasant central pressure after 13.dxc5! (to clear d4 for his pieces) 13...Qxc5 14.Ned4 .

**10.b4**

White forces our hand.

In the next game, we will look at 10.h4 .

**10...cxd4 11.cxd4 O-O**

Black's developmental lead reaches alarming proportions.

**12.h4**

White sets up future Ng5 sacrificial binges. However, you may have noticed that virtually all his pieces remain at home while the clumsy e2-knight gums up development.

After 12.Qd3 Qc7! (clearing the b6-square for his knight) 13.Nc3 Nb6 (the knight eyes the c4-hole) 14.Nb5 Qd8 15.Be2 Nc4 16.O-O Bd7 17.Nc3 b5! , I prefer Black mainly due to the entrenched c4-knight, E.Vitolins-A.Pyshkin, correspondence 1991.

**12...a5!**

Principle: Create confrontation when leading in development.

**13.b5!**

QUESTION: Why did White hand over a pawn on a platter? --- ANSWER: It's a forced blockading sac to take control over b5.

White really doesn't have much choice since he stands clearly worse after 13.bxa5? . I don't see a single game in the database with this weak move and with good reason. Black retains initiative after 13...Qxa5+ 14.Bd2 Qb6 when the a3-pawn is hanging.

**13...Qxb5**

White's queenside is disgorged of a pawn but in return, he gets strong compensation.

**14.Nc3 Qb6 15.Rb1**

Suddenly, White's game springs to life, at the cost of a pawn. He exerts pressure down the b-file and owns the b5-hole.

**15...Qd8 16.Bd3**

White takes aim at h7. There is no reason for White to commit to 16.Nb5 just yet.

**16...h6!**

A strong defensive move.

Black cuts out the Greek-gift sacrificial (Bxh7+ followed by Ng5+) trick. This move was first played in Bauer-Bareev, Enghien les Bains 2003 and is a clear improvement over the following reactions: The slightly panicked 16...f5?! is met by 17.g4! a4 18.gxf5 exf5 19.Nxd5! (some pawns are less poisoned than others) 19...Qa5+ 20.Nd2! with a clear advantage to White, K.Nemcova-E.Danielian, Plovdiv 2008. White's knight doesn't hang on d5 as 20...Qxd5?? will get hit by the 21.Bc4 pin, winning the queen.

16...fxe5 17.dxe5 Nc5? was played in V.Bologan-C.Bauer, Belfort 2002. At this point White had a winning attack with the standard sac 18.Bxh7+! . It's amazing that two 2600+ players misassessed this thematic sac. 18...Kxh7 19.Ng5+ Kg8 20.Qh5 Nd3+ 21.Ke2 Nxc1+ 22.Rbxc1 Bxg5 23.hxg5 Nd4+ 24.Kd3 Nf5 25.Nb5! Qb6 26.Qh8+ Kf7 27.Rc7+ Bd7 28.Nd6+! Nxd6 ( 28...Ke7 29.Nxf5+ exf5 30.Qxg7+ Rf7 31.Rxd7+ is a game-ender ) 29.Rxd7+ Ke8 30.Qxf8+! Kxd7 31.Qxg7+ Kc6 32.exd6 Qb3+ 33.Kd2 Qa2+ 34.Ke3 Qxa3+ 35.Ke2 Qa2+ 36.Kf3 with no perpetual check in sight, Black's king is about to get fried.

**17.Nb5 Na7**

The powerful b5-knight is immediately challenged.

**18.Ng5!?**

Into the wild blue yonder. Normally a revolution-inciting demagogue is put to death for challenging the ruling authority - but only if he or she is caught. Now all hell breaks loose. Within the strands of Black's position is embedded a subliminal message - "Attack me!" so the Charles Mansonesque knight comes charging in with a kind of psychotic klutzy grandeur.

**18...fxg5**

Declining the gift is out of the question as 18...Nb8? is met by 19.Qh5! (the threat is Qg6 and Qh7 mate!) and 19...fxg5 20.hxg5 Qe8 21.Bg6! (even stronger than taking e8 and then forking on c7) 21...Qd7 22.gxh6 gives White a winning attack.

**19.hxg5 Nxb5**

Most certainly not 19...hxg5?? 20.Rh8+ Kxh8 21.Qh5+ Kg8 22.Qh7+ Kf7 23.Bg6# mate! The bishop ministers to the spiritual needs of his flock, whether they ask for it or not.

**20.gxh6?**

White crosses a barrier and pushes into unsound territory.

He extracts a strong attack after 20.Rxb5! , yet Black's defensive resources look adequate to the task as well after 20...Rf7 21.Bg6 Qe8! (triple purpose: Black's queen protects f7, keeps an eye on the b5-rook and keeps f8 clear for his knight) 22.gxh6 Nf8! ( 22...Nxe5?? 23.dxe5 Qxb5 24.Qh5! gives White a winning attack ) 23.Bxf7+ Qxf7 24.hxg7 Kxg7 25.Rb3 Qf5 when it's anybody's game. Houdini rates this even while I prefer Black's minor pieces over White's attacking chances.

**20...Bh4+ 21.Kf1**

EXERCISE (critical decision): Should Black's knight fork on c3? Or should he take d4?

**21...Nc3?**

Back returns the favour.

ANSWER: Black consolidates with 21...Nxd4! 22.hxg7 Kxg7 and 23.Qg4+ is met with the cool 23...Qg5 when Black defends everything.

**22.Qg4**

Threatening mate on the move as well as hitting the hanging h4-bishop and also the e6-pawn.

**22...Qg5!**

White's attacking attempts do little to ruffle Black, who thwarts the mating threats at every turn.

**23.Qxe6+?**

One wrong step and White risks a plunge into a dark, bottomless abyss. Taking the pawn with check is tempting yet incorrect.

White should play 23.Rxh4! Qxg4 24.Rxg4 when taking the b1-rook leads to perpetual check.

**23...Kh8 24.hxg7+ Kxg7 25.f5**

EXERCISE (critical decision): Black to play and win: Should he play 25...Qh5 which covers h6 and threatens ...Qd1 (mate!) or should he play 25...Qg3 which threatens ...Qf2 (mate too!) and hits the White's d3-bishop. Be careful. Only one of the lines works.

**25...Qh5?**

In attempting to shield the h6 weakness, Black inadvertently calls attention to it, making it all the more conspicuous.

ANSWER: 25...Qg3! is a killing double attack and game ender after 26.Qh6+ Kg8 27.Be3 Nxe5! . The knight had kept e5 within eyeshot, awaiting the correct moment to strike. After 28.Rh3 Qg6! , the queen addresses her court, "You would all do well to regard me as a model by which to base your own lives upon." Remarkably, Black's king continues to reside in a region of luxurious ease, despite the storm-driven attackers swirling about. 29.Qxh4 Bxf5 30.Kg1 Nf3+! (a good deflection shot!) 31.Rxf3 Bxd3 and the trouble is 32.Rg3 fails miserably to 32...Ne2+ when White's king is ejected from his resting place, as if bucked from a wild horse.

**26.g4!**

This should force a draw.

**26...Qxg4 27.Qh6+**

27.Rg1 is met with the calm 27...Bg3 28.Bh6+ Kh8! and Black wins, since White runs out of checks while Black threatens mate on f3.

**27...Kf7 28.Qe6+ Kg7 29.Qh6+ Kg8 30.Rxh4??**

Caught right smack in the eye of a hurricane, we kid ourselves to believe there is no storm around us. In this case White refuses to act upon well-grounded apprehensions. Can a lifelong sinner sneak his way into heaven? The surest path to suicide in a chess game is to refuse to relent when the position screams that we should. However in time trouble, we live in a world of supposition, mingled with a belief in our own lucky star. In this instance, White pushed his luck too far and this astrological misalliance returns to haunt him.

should just take the perpetual check with 30.Rb2!? Rxf5+ 31.Bxf5 Qxf5+ 32.Kg1 Qg4+ 33.Rg2 Ne2+ 34.Kf1 Ng3+ 35.Rxg3 Bxg3 36.Qh8+ Kf7 37.Rh7+ Ke6 38.Rh6+ Ke7 ( 38...Kf5?? 39.Qh7+ and White mates on the next move ) 39.Rh7+ Ke6 instead.

**30...Rxf5+ 31.Bxf5**

EXERCISE (combination alert): The expansive sweep of White's dishevelment grows painfully apparent. Black to play and force mate in four moves. --- ANSWER: Zwischenzug. The surprise eclipses White's expectations. Black inserts an important proviso to the contract: He is under no obligation to automatically recapture f5.

**31...Qf3+!**

The queen, feeling that tolerance has been pushed to her limits, decides the time has arrived to punish the f1-upstart, beginning her lecture with "I fully expected this attitude of non-cooperation. So now, we shall begin your re-education".

White is doomed after 31...Qf3+ 32.Kg1 Ne2+ 33.Kh2 Qg3+ 34.Kh1 Qg1# mate! The queen professes shock and dismay at her brother's sudden and mysterious death. Yet the faintest hint of the Mona Lisa smile on her lips betrays her true feelings.

White must have hoped for the blundering 31...Qxf5+?? 32.Ke1 Nf8 33.Qh8+ Kf7 34.Rb6 Ne4 35.Rf4 and White wins instead. --- SUMMARY: Bartel's adoption of Bareev's 16...h6! dampens White's kingside ambitions considerably. Black's chances look at least even in the coming complications.

0-1

### (25)Lupulescu, C.   --   Smerdon, D. 9: Chess Olympiad, Calvia  2004   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3**

Tarrasch French: 3.Nd2 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.c3 Nc6 7.Ndf3 Qb6 8.g3 f6 9.Ne2 .

**3...Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.Nce2**

QUESTION: Why is this variation called the Shirov-Anand Line? ANSWER: This idea was played by Anand in his 2000 FIDE World Championships match against Shirov in the fourth and final game (See Game 11). Anand won the match 3.5-0.5, by the way. QUESTION: The move openly violates principles: 1. Don't move the same piece more than once in the opening. 2. Don't clog your development, which the knight clearly does on e2. Am I correct in this assumption? ANSWER: It's no easy task to examine a situation from the opponent's point of view, mainly since our own perspective tends to block out the horizon. You are correct, yet it's still a good move and White scores 55.1% with it - an average score for a white opening. The line is also played at the very highest levels, being a particular favourite of Anand, who has accumulated a devastating score with it as White. White's ideas behind the move: Unlike the first chapter, where Black undermines White's centre with ...c5, ...cxd4 and later ...f6, in the case of the Shirov-Anand Line, White intends to back up the gigantic centre with c3 and also f4, intending to recapture on d4 and e5 with pawns. This means White annexes massive territory, hoping to deny the opponent counterplay and essentially asphyxiate Black. Of course, there is a huge catch to White's dreams - the fact that White, while busily erecting the centre, wilfully neglects development. It is up to us to find a way to open the position early and exploit this factor. It is not enough to merely play ...c5, ...cxd4, ...f6 and ...fxe5. We must keep in mind the possibility of ...g5 and also look for exchange sacs on f3, not forgetting piece sac options on d4 and e5 to exploit our developmental lead.

**5...c5 6.c3**

For simplicity's sake, on 6.f4 , let's avoid the sideline 6...cxd4 ( and just continue 6...Nc6 which should simply transpose to the games in this chapter. )

**6...Nc6 7.f4 Qb6**

Black's main move in the position, where the queen adds firepower to both d4 and b2.

In the book, we won't be covering 7...cxd4

or 7...b5

and in the final game of the chapter, we will cover 7...Be7 .

**8.Nf3**

QUESTION: Wait a minute...this seems familiar. Doesn't this look like a French Tarrasch setup? ANSWER: Well done! The position may actually begin with a Classical move order, yet it transposes to a known variation of the Tarrasch French. Compare the position we get in the game, with this one, arising from Tarrasch French after 3 Nd2 Nf6 4 e5 Nfd7 5 f4 c5 6 c3 Nc6 7 Ndf3 Qb6 8 Ne2, reaching the same setup. So your eyes didn't deceive you (see the 3 Nd2 variation).

**8...f6**

A logical extension of our undermining project.

Later in the chapter, we will examine the lines 8...Be7

and 8...a5 .

**9.g3**

QUESTION: More time loss? ANSWER: White must find a way to develop the kingside, so he plans Bh3 to take aim at the newly weakened e6-square. GM Neil McDonald calls the move "extremely ambitious".

In the next two games of the chapter, we will look at 9.a3 .

**9...cxd4 10.cxd4**

10.Nexd4 is inconsistent with White's philosophy in the line, since it accords Black the possibility of dismantling the big centre. After 10...fxe5 11.fxe5 ( 11.Nxe6 Nf6 12.Nxf8 Bg4! 13.Ne6 Bxe6 14.Nxe5 O-O offers Black a massive developmental lead, which easily outweighs the lost pawn, K.Suwara-G.De Melo, correspondence 2007 ) 11...Nc5 12.Bh3 Be7 13.O-O O-O 14.Qe2 Nxd4 15.Nxd4 Rxf1+ 16.Kxf1 Bd7 17.Kg2 , Black managed to chip away at White's once imposing centre and also develop his pieces harmoniously, V.Atlas-T.Luther, Austria 2001.

**10...Bb4+!**

This move gains time, since blocking with the bishop doesn't work for White.

**11.Nc3**

Forced.

White has scored disastrously after 11.Bd2? . Following 11...fxe5 12.fxe5 O-O 13.Bg2 Ndxe5! 14.dxe5 Nxe5 (Black's latent mating threat on f2 makes this move possible) 15.Ned4? ( Houdini claims White's only prayer lies in the line 15.Bxb4 Qxb4+ 16.Kf2 Qe4 17.Nc3 Nd3+ 18.Kf1 Qc4 19.Qa4 Nb4+ 20.Ke1 e5 which looks pretty awful as well for White as his king is left bouncing around the middle of the board ) 15...Nc4 16.Bc3 e5 17.Nc2 , A,Finkel-F.Holzke, Groningen 1996, now crushing is 17...Nxb2! 18.Qd2 Bxc3 19.Qxc3 e4 .

11.Kf2?? This plays into our hands after 11...fxe5 12.fxe5 Ndxe5 with an extra pawn, a developmental lead and a winning position. Seven unfortunate players had fallen for this trap according to my database. Maybe one of our future opponents may volunteer to be unlucky number eight?

**11...O-O**

More accurate than 11...fxe5 12.fxe5 O-O since it allows White 13.Bf4 . Now Black went for it with 13...Ndxe5 14.Bxe5 Nxe5 15.Nxe5 Bxc3+ 16.bxc3 Qb2 (threatening mate on f2 and also the c3-pawn) 17.Qc1 Qf2+ 18.Kd1 Qxf1+ 19.Rxf1 Rxf1+ 20.Kd2 Rxc1 21.Rxc1 b6 22.Rf1 Rb8 23.Rf7 Rb7 24.Rxb7 Bxb7 and White's good knight versus Black's bad bishop saved the former in the pawn-down ending, R.Robson-G.Meier, Lubbock 2010.

**12.a3**

QUESTION: Can White relieve some of the central pressure by agreeing to a concession with 12.exf6 ? ANSWER: The move does reduce the central pressure for White, but it also helps Black unravel. Black gets excellent chances after 12...Nxf6 13.Be3?! , and now Black can utilize his developmental lead by blasting open the centre favourably with ( 13.a3 avoids Black's coming trick, T.Fogarasi-M.Guzijan, Budapest 1990 ) 13...e5! 14.Nxe5 Nxe5 15.fxe5 Bg4 16.Be2 Bxe2 17.Qxe2 Ne4 18.Rc1 Qa5 , thus threatens both the a2-pawn and the c3-knight. After 19.a3 Bxc3+ 20.bxc3 Rac8 , Black regains lost material. More pertinent is that he retains the dominant position with a continuing developmental lead, the superior minor piece and White's king is still stuck in the middle.

**12...Be7 13.Bh3 fxe5!?**

To agree to the decapitation of your central pawns is no minor matter. Yet generosity of such magnitude is a commonplace trait in our system. With our last move, we refuse to bother with defence of the e6-pawn and sign a war declaration, relying solely upon our considerable developmental lead.

Black doesn't have to sac as 13...Kh8 is also playable, with the idea that after 14.Na4 ( 14.Bxe6?! is met with 14...Ndxe5! 15.Bxd5 Nxf3+ 16.Bxf3 Nxd4 with a serious developmental lead for Black ) 14...Qc7 15.O-O Nb6 16.Nc3 Bd7 17.Kg2 f5 , chances look about even. Black continues to lead in development and will soon generate queenside counterplay, S.Grover-E.Danielian, Groningen 2009.

**14.Bxe6+**

White is not one to allow such a provocation to pass unchallenged.

**14...Kh8 15.Nxd5 Qd8 16.Bxd7**

This ensures us the bishop pair and domination of the light squares. QUESTION: I'm getting a bit concerned. We are dropping pawns left and right. Is Black still okay here?

ANSWER: Black's developmental lead continues to give him full compensation in every version. For example: 16.Nxe7 Qxe7 17.d5 e4 18.Ng5 Nc5 19.Bxc8 Nd3+ 20.Kf1 Raxc8 21.dxc6 Qxg5 22.cxb7 Rb8 23.Kg2 , A.Lukin-S.Ivanov, Soviet Union 1984. Here, Black has a powerful attack and initiative after 23...Qc5 .

16.dxe5 Ndxe5! 17.Nxe5 Bxe6 18.Nxe7 Qxe7 19.Nxc6 bxc6 20.O-O Bd5 and Black's powerful light-squared bishop (thanks to the favourable opposite-coloured bishops situation) comfortably makes up for the pawn deficit.

**16...Bxd7 17.dxe5**

17.Nxe7 Qxe7 18.dxe5 Rad8 19.Qd6 Qf7 (Black's developmental lead and light-square control easily override White's two extra pawns) 20.Qc5 Bg4 21.O-O Bxf3! and White actually resigned in J.Barlow-A.Gaujens, coorrepondence 2002 as after 22.Rxf3 Nd4 23.Re3 Qf5 24.Bd2 Nc2 25.Rd1 Nxe3 26.Qxe3 Qc2 27.Qe2 Rd4 28.e6 Rfd8 29.e7 Re8 , the situation is hopeless for White.

**17...Bg4**

Threat: 18...Nxe5!.<addx start="18...Nxe5"/>

**18.O-O Bc5+ 19.Be3 Bxe3+ 20.Nxe3 Qb6**

Attacking b2 and the pinned e3-knight.

**21.Qd2**

EXERCISE (combination alert): How did Black, currently down two pawns, pick up the exchange? ANSWER: Attraction/double attack.

**21...Bxf3! 22.Rxf3**

The rook is lured to the tactically unfavourable f3-square.

**22...Nd4**

Double attack on the f3-rook and the b3-fork square.

**23.Rff1**

GM Smagin suggests 23.Raf1 but now, rather than immediately taking the f3-rook, Black can play the zwischenzug 23...Rfd8 24.Qg2 Nxf3+ 25.Qxf3 Rd3 26.Re1 Qxb2 with advantage to Black.

**23...Nb3 24.Qe2?!**

A new move,

though inferior to the previously played 24.Qf2! Nxa1 25.Rxa1 Rae8! 26.Rc1 g5! 27.Ng4 Qxf2+ 28.Kxf2 gxf4 29.Rc7 fxg3+ 30.Kxg3 Rg8 31.Kf4? S.Smagin-V.Dimitrov, Prilep 1992.. Now Black should play ( Correct was 31.Kf3 after which chances should have been even ) 31...Rc8! which forces White to swap his active rook, giving Black a winning ending.

**24...Nxa1 25.Rxa1 g5 !**

This thematic destabilizer of a move lowers the barrier to Black's overall goal and sends White the message "Your king is more exposed than mine." Normally two pawns for an exchange is plenty but not here, since White's king is more precariously placed than Black's and his e- and f-pawns will soon become unstable.

**26.Rf1 gxf4 27.gxf4 Rf5?**

I don't get this move as it appears to be an allusion to the correct idea, rather than the real thing. One senses that Black's confidence in his attack refuses to wane. His last move is a waste of time, after which the game becomes unclear.

Correct was 27...Rad8! , intending to destabilize White's centre further with ...Rd4 thus giving Black a clear advantage.

**28.Kh1!**

After this useful move, Black simply lost a tempo.

**28...Rf7 29.f5 Rg8 30.e6**

The pawns are deeply entrenched now.

**30...Rfg7**

Threat: ...Qc6+ to force mate.

**31.Qf3**

White fends off the mate and threatens to blast forward with f6.

**31...Rg5 32.b4**

32.f6?? doesn't cut it after 32...Qxe6 33.f7 Rf8 when the f7-pawn soon falls as well.

**32...Qd6 33.Nd5 Rg3!?**

"I wish I may, I wish I might, Have the wish I wish tonight," thinks the rook. White's indignation is quickly replaced by astonishment.

33...Rg2 forces a draw after 34.Nf4 Rc2 35.f6 Qd2 36.Ne2! Qxe2 37.Qxe2 Rxe2 38.e7 . This looks ominous but Black is equal to the task of containing White's promotion ambitions after 38...Re6 39.f7 Rxe7 40.fxg8=Q+ Kxg8 .

**34.Qd1**

Perhaps White is playing for the win.

34.hxg3 Rxg3 and we examine the following:

Most certainly not 35.Qe4?? as after 35...Rh3+ ("God save the king," whispers the anti-royalist, with a smile, as he reveals a dagger before White's king) 36.Kg2 Qh2# is mate!

Also fatal is 35.e7?? Qh6+ 36.Qh5 Qxh5# with mate once again.

35.Ne3! Rxf3 36.Rxf3 Kg8 and neither side can make progress and the position should be drawn.

**34...R3g4!**

Somehow the rook emerged from the fight with all his teeth intact. He sidesteps a would-be assailant with bored indifference, all the while setting up a sneaky mate threat. Black's move covers against Qd4+ and sets up ...Qxh2+! followed by ...Rh4 mate!

**35.Qf3?!**

White's game sours through irresolute play.

Correct was 35.Qd3! Qe5 36.Nf4! Rxf4 37.Rxf4 Qxf4 38.Qc3+ Rg7 39.Qc8+ Rg8 40.Qc3+ which ends in perpetual check.

**35...Qe5!**

Suddenly, White's pawns are in real danger.

**36.e7?**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Black can force the win here. How?

Also bad is 36.Ne3?? Re4 37.Ng2 Re2 38.Rf2 Qa1+ 39.Rf1 Qb2 40.Rg1 Rexg2! and Black wins.

White's last prayer is 36.Nf4! Qxf5 37.Qc3+ R4g7 38.Qd4 when he still retains chances to save the game.

**36...Rh4?**

This allows White back into the game. Missing a combination is like a judge telling a confessed serial killer: "The court leaves guilt or innocence to the dictates of the defendant's own conscience."

ANSWER: Black misses 36...Re4! which destabilizes White and forces him to come face to face with the magnitude of his error. If 37.f6 Re1! (threat: ...Rxf1+ followed by ...Qxd5+) 38.Nf4 Qe4! and White is helpless to defend against Black's multiple pin/overload threats.

**37.Nf4! Qxe7**

37...Qxf5?? 38.Qc3+ is mate in two moves.

**38.Qc3+ Qg7 39.f6 Qf7 40.Qe5**

White prays that his deeply passed f-pawn will hold the game.

**40...b6 41.b5 Rhg4!**

Setting up a deadly threat of a queen check on b7.

**42.h3**

42.Qf5?? Qb7+ 43.Nd5 R4g5 wins.

**42...Rg3 43.Kh2**

A mistake but White was busted anyway. EXERCISE (combination alert): A cloud of anxiety hangs over White's king. Black to play and win.ANSWER: Double attack/deflection.

His best hope to resist was 43.Re1 though it would have been futile with careful play from Black.

**43...Qa2+**

Quick as a shadow, the queen strikes. "A well-aimed arrow at my brother's heart will finally resolve our misunderstanding," thinks Black's queen.

**44.Ne2**

On 44.Kh1 , White's defences get punctured, as if with a pin cushion, with the deflection shot 44...Rxh3+ 45.Nxh3 Qg2# .

**44...Rg2+ 45.Kh1 Rxe2**

. SUMMARY: In the Shirov-Anand Line, we enter a classic battle between structure and dynamism. It is imperative to rely on our lead in development, even if we must keep sac'ing to maintain our initiative.

0-1

### (26)Baramidze, D.   --   Bartel, M. 10: German League  2012   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4**

QUESTION: Didn't you cover this in Chapter One? ANSWER: We can also reach the Shirov-Anand Line with this move order.

**5...c5 6.Nce2 Nc6**

QUESTION: Shouldn't we punish White for his failure to play c3 by playing 6...cxd4 ? ANSWER: It's playable but most GMs just stick to 6...Nc6, the move Bartel played in the game. After 6...cxd4, White retains absolute control over d4 after 7.Nxd4 Nc6 . Even though now Black threatens ...Ndxe5! followed by ...Qh4, every opponent in the universe is going to respond with White's next move, even if he or she doesn't spot the trap. After the natural 8.Ngf3 Nc5 9.Be3 Bd7 10.c3 Be7 11.Nb3 b6! 12.Be2 Nxb3 13.axb3 Bc5 14.Qd2 a5 15.O-O O-O 16.Bd3 Qe7 17.Kh1 f6 18.exf6 gxf6!? 19.Rae1 , White has a dynamic position where his attacking chances get the nod over Black's central potential, C.Bauer-M.Gurevich, Belfort 2003.

**7.c3 Qb6 8.Nf3 f6 9.a3**

White continues to follow his leisurely strategy, putting off development for later, with the belief that Black experiences difficulty in opening the game to exploit his developmental lead.

**9...Be7**

QUESTION: If we know White is planning to resolve central tension with b4, then why not prevent it with 9...a5 ? ANSWER: The move is playable but we actually don't mind White playing b4, since this allows us ...a5, undermining White's queenside. 10.g3 (White follows the game plan from the previous game in the chapter) 10...Be7 11.Bh3 Nf8 ( 11...f5 is exactly what White wants ) 12.exf6 Bxf6 occurred in A.Ivanov-A.Bykhovsky, New York 1990 when White can exert unpleasant central pressure after 13.dxc5! (to clear d4 for his pieces) 13...Qxc5 14.Ned4 .

**10.b4**

White forces our hand.

In the next game, we will look at 10.h4 .

**10...cxd4 11.cxd4 O-O**

Black's developmental lead reaches alarming proportions.

**12.h4**

White sets up future Ng5 sacrificial binges. However, you may have noticed that virtually all his pieces remain at home while the clumsy e2-knight gums up development.

After 12.Qd3 Qc7! (clearing the b6-square for his knight) 13.Nc3 Nb6 (the knight eyes the c4-hole) 14.Nb5 Qd8 15.Be2 Nc4 16.O-O Bd7 17.Nc3 b5! , I prefer Black mainly due to the entrenched c4-knight, E.Vitolins-A.Pyshkin, correspondence 1991.

**12...a5!**

Principle: Create confrontation when leading in development.

**13.b5!**

QUESTION: Why did White hand over a pawn on a platter? ANSWER: It's a forced blockading sac to take control over b5.

White really doesn't have much choice since he stands clearly worse after 13.bxa5? . I don't see a single game in the database with this weak move and with good reason. Black retains initiative after 13...Qxa5+ 14.Bd2 Qb6 when the a3-pawn is hanging.

**13...Qxb5**

White's queenside is disgorged of a pawn but in return, he gets strong compensation.

**14.Nc3 Qb6 15.Rb1**

Suddenly, White's game springs to life, at the cost of a pawn. He exerts pressure down the b-file and owns the b5-hole.

**15...Qd8 16.Bd3**

White takes aim at h7. There is no reason for White to commit to 16.Nb5 just yet.

**16...h6!**

A strong defensive move.

Black cuts out the Greek-gift sacrificial (Bxh7+ followed by Ng5+) trick. This move was first played in Bauer-Bareev, Enghien les Bains 2003 and is a clear improvement over the following reactions: The slightly panicked 16...f5?! is met by 17.g4! a4 18.gxf5 exf5 19.Nxd5! (some pawns are less poisoned than others) 19...Qa5+ 20.Nd2! with a clear advantage to White, K.Nemcova-E.Danielian, Plovdiv 2008. White's knight doesn't hang on d5 as 20...Qxd5?? will get hit by the 21.Bc4 pin, winning the queen.

16...fxe5 17.dxe5 Nc5? was played in V.Bologan-C.Bauer, Belfort 2002. At this point White had a winning attack with the standard sac 18.Bxh7+! . It's amazing that two 2600+ players misassessed this thematic sac. 18...Kxh7 19.Ng5+ Kg8 20.Qh5 Nd3+ 21.Ke2 Nxc1+ 22.Rbxc1 Bxg5 23.hxg5 Nd4+ 24.Kd3 Nf5 25.Nb5! Qb6 26.Qh8+ Kf7 27.Rc7+ Bd7 28.Nd6+! Nxd6 ( 28...Ke7 29.Nxf5+ exf5 30.Qxg7+ Rf7 31.Rxd7+ is a game-ender ) 29.Rxd7+ Ke8 30.Qxf8+! Kxd7 31.Qxg7+ Kc6 32.exd6 Qb3+ 33.Kd2 Qa2+ 34.Ke3 Qxa3+ 35.Ke2 Qa2+ 36.Kf3 with no perpetual check in sight, Black's king is about to get fried.

**17.Nb5 Na7**

The powerful b5-knight is immediately challenged.

**18.Ng5!?**

Into the wild blue yonder. Normally a revolution-inciting demagogue is put to death for challenging the ruling authority - but only if he or she is caught. Now all hell breaks loose. Within the strands of Black's position is embedded a subliminal message - "Attack me!" so the Charles Mansonesque knight comes charging in with a kind of psychotic klutzy grandeur.

**18...fxg5**

Declining the gift is out of the question as 18...Nb8? is met by 19.Qh5! (the threat is Qg6 and Qh7 mate!) and 19...fxg5 20.hxg5 Qe8 21.Bg6! (even stronger than taking e8 and then forking on c7) 21...Qd7 22.gxh6 gives White a winning attack.

**19.hxg5 Nxb5**

Most certainly not 19...hxg5?? 20.Rh8+ Kxh8 21.Qh5+ Kg8 22.Qh7+ Kf7 23.Bg6# mate! The bishop ministers to the spiritual needs of his flock, whether they ask for it or not.

**20.gxh6?**

White crosses a barrier and pushes into unsound territory.

He extracts a strong attack after 20.Rxb5! , yet Black's defensive resources look adequate to the task as well after 20...Rf7 21.Bg6 Qe8! (triple purpose: Black's queen protects f7, keeps an eye on the b5-rook and keeps f8 clear for his knight) 22.gxh6 Nf8! ( 22...Nxe5?? 23.dxe5 Qxb5 24.Qh5! gives White a winning attack ) 23.Bxf7+ Qxf7 24.hxg7 Kxg7 25.Rb3 Qf5 when it's anybody's game. Houdini rates this even while I prefer Black's minor pieces over White's attacking chances.

**20...Bh4+ 21.Kf1**

EXERCISE (critical decision): Should Black's knight fork on c3? Or should he take d4?

**21...Nc3?**

Back returns the favour.

ANSWER: Black consolidates with 21...Nxd4! 22.hxg7 Kxg7 and 23.Qg4+ is met with the cool 23...Qg5 when Black defends everything.

**22.Qg4**

Threatening mate on the move as well as hitting the hanging h4-bishop and also the e6-pawn.

**22...Qg5!**

White's attacking attempts do little to ruffle Black, who thwarts the mating threats at every turn.

**23.Qxe6+?**

One wrong step and White risks a plunge into a dark, bottomless abyss. Taking the pawn with check is tempting yet incorrect.

White should play 23.Rxh4! Qxg4 24.Rxg4 when taking the b1-rook leads to perpetual check.

**23...Kh8 24.hxg7+ Kxg7 25.f5**

EXERCISE (critical decision): Black to play and win: Should he play 25...Qh5 which covers h6 and threatens ...Qd1 (mate!) or should he play 25...Qg3 which threatens ...Qf2 (mate too!) and hits the White's d3-bishop. Be careful. Only one of the lines works.

**25...Qh5?**

In attempting to shield the h6 weakness, Black inadvertently calls attention to it, making it all the more conspicuous.

ANSWER: 25...Qg3! is a killing double attack and game ender after 26.Qh6+ Kg8 27.Be3 Nxe5! . The knight had kept e5 within eyeshot, awaiting the correct moment to strike. After 28.Rh3 Qg6! , the queen addresses her court, "You would all do well to regard me as a model by which to base your own lives upon." Remarkably, Black's king continues to reside in a region of luxurious ease, despite the storm-driven attackers swirling about. 29.Qxh4 Bxf5 30.Kg1 Nf3+! (a good deflection shot!) 31.Rxf3 Bxd3 and the trouble is 32.Rg3 fails miserably to 32...Ne2+ when White's king is ejected from his resting place, as if bucked from a wild horse.

**26.g4!**

This should force a draw.

**26...Qxg4 27.Qh6+**

27.Rg1 is met with the calm 27...Bg3 28.Bh6+ Kh8! and Black wins, since White runs out of checks while Black threatens mate on f3.

**27...Kf7 28.Qe6+ Kg7 29.Qh6+ Kg8 30.Rxh4??**

Caught right smack in the eye of a hurricane, we kid ourselves to believe there is no storm around us. In this case White refuses to act upon well-grounded apprehensions. Can a lifelong sinner sneak his way into heaven? The surest path to suicide in a chess game is to refuse to relent when the position screams that we should. However in time trouble, we live in a world of supposition, mingled with a belief in our own lucky star. In this instance, White pushed his luck too far and this astrological misalliance returns to haunt him.

should just take the perpetual check with 30.Rb2!? Rxf5+ 31.Bxf5 Qxf5+ 32.Kg1 Qg4+ 33.Rg2 Ne2+ 34.Kf1 Ng3+ 35.Rxg3 Bxg3 36.Qh8+ Kf7 37.Rh7+ Ke6 38.Rh6+ Ke7 ( 38...Kf5?? 39.Qh7+ and White mates on the next move ) 39.Rh7+ Ke6 instead.

**30...Rxf5+ 31.Bxf5**

EXERCISE (combination alert): The expansive sweep of White's dishevelment grows painfully apparent. Black to play and force mate in four moves: ANSWER: Zwischenzug. The surprise eclipses White's expectations. Black inserts an important proviso to the contract: He is under no obligation to automatically recapture f5.

**31...Qf3+!**

The queen, feeling that tolerance has been pushed to her limits, decides the time has arrived to punish the f1-upstart, beginning her lecture with "I fully expected this attitude of non-cooperation. So now, we shall begin your re-education".

White is doomed after 31...Qf3+ 32.Kg1 Ne2+ 33.Kh2 Qg3+ 34.Kh1 Qg1# mate! The queen professes shock and dismay at her brother's sudden and mysterious death. Yet the faintest hint of the Mona Lisa smile on her lips betrays her true feelings.

White must have hoped for the blundering 31...Qxf5+?? 32.Ke1 Nf8 33.Qh8+ Kf7 34.Rb6 Ne4 35.Rf4 and White wins instead. SUMMARY: Bartel's adoption of Bareev's 16...h6! dampens White's kingside ambitions considerably. Black's chances look at least even in the coming complications.

0-1

### (27)Anand, V.   --   Shirov, A. 11: FIDE World Ch Final, Tehran  2000   1-0   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

We now come to the players who propelled this line into prominence by contesting it at the top level. 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.Nce2 c5 6.f4 Nc6 7.c3 Qb6 8.Nf3 f6

QUESTION: Why not ...Be7 and leave ...f6 for later?

ANSWER: Shirov hopes to play, under certain circumstances, ...cxd4 and ...Bb4+, without wasting a move on ...Be7. However, transpositional possibilities might occur after 8...Be7 9.a3 O-O 10.h4!? f6 11.Rh3 and the players reached a position in the stem game. Following 11...Na5!? 12.b4! cxb4 13.axb4 Nc4 14.Ng3 a5 15.Bd3 f5 ( Shirov didn't want to allow 15...Ra7 16.Ng5! and if 16...fxg5?? 17.Bxh7+! Kxh7 18.hxg5+ Kg8 , 19.g6 is decisive ) 16.Ng5 Rd8 17.Qh5 Bxg5 18.Qxg5! ( setting up the threat of Nh5 and Black looks okay after 18.hxg5 Nf8 ) 18...Rf8 19.Nh5 Rf7 20.Rg3 g6 , a critical weakening is induced. After 21.Bxc4 dxc4 22.b5! , Anand finds a way to bring the c1-bishop into the attack, culminating in 22...Qxb5 23.Ba3 b6 24.Qh6 Bb7 25.Rxg6+! hxg6 26.Qxg6+ Kh8 27.Qxf7 Rg8 . --- EXERCISE (combination alert): White to play and force mate. --- ANSWER: Overloading the defenders with 28.Bf8! and Black resigned in V.Anand-A.Shirov, Frankfurt 2000, since 28...Nxf8 29.Nf6 forces mate. --- We will also look at another White plan 9 g3 in the 8...Be7 line in Games 12.

**9.a3**

Ending all ...Bb4+ ideas.

Shirov may have intended 9.h4 cxd4 10.cxd4 Bb4+ .

**9...Be7 10.h4 O-O 11.Rh3**

The players transposed to their previous game from the above note.

**11...a5!?**

Black restrains b4 in an attempt to improve over Shirov's previously played 11...Na5!? .

**12.b3!**

Anand is alert to the demands of the position. --- QUESTION: Why did White toss in b3? --- ANSWER: Anand prevented Black's coming light-squared bind, based upon the plan ...a4 and then eventually ...Na5 and either ...Nc4 or ...Nb3.

**12...Qc7!**

QUESTION: Why did Black retreat his well-placed queen? --- ANSWER: Shirov possibly intends to free his congested queenside and especially the dead c8-bishop with ...b6, followed by ...Ba6.

Anand also indicated in ChessBase Magazine 81 that he preferred this over 12...Qd8 since "this move looks much better" and "for a start, there are possibilities of Qc3+ in some lines".

**13.Neg1!?**

QUESTION: What on earth is the point of undeveloping like this? --- ANSWER: Anand plans to unravel with Bd3 and knight back to e2. The obvious problem: White's position may not tolerate such a flagrant violation of principle.

**13...a4!?**

Played with the intention of the coming piece sac.

Black can also play the calmer 13...b6! . ( . If 14.Bd3 , Black gets away with 14...Ba6! since the h7-sac looks unsound, after 15.Bxh7+?? Kxh7 16.Ng5+ fxg5 17.hxg5+ Kg8 18.Qh5 ( 18.g6? is met with the clever 18...Bg5! ) 18...Bxg5! . This move refutes White's sac. If 19.fxg5 ( 19.Qh7+ Kf7 20.Qh5+ g6 21.Qh7+ Ke8 22.Qxg6+ Rf7 23.Qxe6+ Be7 24.Qxd5 cxd4! 25.e6 Rg7 26.exd7+ Qxd7 Black consolidates ) 19...Rf1+ 20.Kd2 Raf8 , White attack splutters to a halt and he can resign. ) ( 14.Ra2 Ba6 15.Bxa6 Rxa6 With the removal of the light-squared bishops, Black's king looks a lot safer and his queenside initiative continues, O.Hartvig-S.Brynell, Helsingor 2011. )

**14.b4 fxe5 15.fxe5 Ndxe5!**

The position is a composite of White's and Black's intentions. Their conflicting ideas clash in a battle to the death as Black's dreamed-of plan, for so long quiescent, now self-activates. Shirov refuses to worry about details and plays the position with the perspective of an impressionist painter, who just hopes the colours fall correctly. --- QUESTION: Does Black get enough for the piece? --- ANSWER: I believe so. Black gets two central pawns, a developmental lead, the initiative and attacking chances for the piece. A fair deal.

**16.dxe5 Nxe5 17.Nxe5 Qxe5+ 18.Qe2**

EXERCISE (combination alert): How did Shirov pick up a third pawn for the piece?

Instead, 18.Ne2 prevents Black's following combination. After 18...Qf5 19.Rf3 Bxh4+ 20.Kd2 , now Black can take a draw if he wants one with 20...Bg5+ 21.Ke1 Bh4+ .

**18...Bxh4+!**

ANSWER: Deflection/double attack. --- A hissing arrow grazes the white king's face, leaving a thin red line as a permanent reminder of the experience. Black gains a third pawn for the piece.

**19.Kd1**

EXERCISE (critical decision): Should Black agree to swap queens with 19...Bf6, or should he risk 19...Qf6 as 19.Rxh4?? is met with 19...Qg3+ clinching the rook.

**19...Qf6?**

Perseverance, when directed at an unworthy cause, fails to bring profit, as in this case, where Black's strenuous exertions to continue attacking lead nowhere. To Shirov, caution is simply a language he doesn't understand, and he misreads the position's signals. Naturally, he desires the queens to remain on the board. But in doing so he cuts off his h4-bishop. The navigation of such complex positions isn't an exact science. Success depends upon the power of our chaos-intuition, and in this case, Anand's proves superior.

ANSWER: Correct was 19...Bf6 20.Qxe5 Bxe5 21.Bd3 g6 with approximately even chances.

**20.Nf3 Qxc3**

Shirov picks up a fourth pawn for the piece but Anand has seen deeper into the position.

Also hopeless was going into desperation mode with 20...g5 21.Nxh4 Qxf1+ 22.Qxf1 Rxf1+ 23.Ke2 Rxc1 24.Rxc1 gxh4 25.Rxh4 b6 26.Ke3 Ra7 27.bxc5 bxc5 28.Rg4+ Rg7 29.Rxa4 and the g2-pawn isn't hanging since White threatens Ra8.

**21.Bb2**

The disgraced, disrobed bishop, now free from monastic constraints and unencumbered by all forms of morality, decides which commandment he would like to break first.

**21...Qb3+ 22.Kc1!**

This shocker appears unheralded by previous warning and may be the move Shirov overlooked in his calculations. Perhaps he expected a queen swap with Qc2, when it is Black who stands better. Suddenly, Black's long unblemished position displays signs which indicate otherwise. White's king graciously holds the door open for Black's queen, beckoning her into a trap on b3, with an "after you" gesture. To come up with a rational plan from such chaos, we first begin by isolating the facts: 1. Anand's deep point is revealed: A deadly double attack. White's forces - hungry carrion birds - camp out, awaiting the black queen's inevitable death. White threatens Ne5, trapping Black's queen in the middle of the board. --- 2. White also threatens the hanging h4-bishop. Conclusion: Black is obliged to hand over a second piece to extricate his queen.

**22...e5!**

Black's best practical chance. One can still make good moves, even when busted. Not liking the hand he has, Shirov decides to reshuffle and deal, radically altering the landscape with a desperado sac of a second piece, in exchange for a wall of pawns, all hungry to promote. The idea arises as an alloy of optimism and desperation.

Instead, 22...Bf6 fails miserably to 23.Bxf6 Rxf6 24.Nd2 when Black's queen is void of sanctuary.

**23.Rxh4**

Anand takes the second piece.

Even stronger was 23.Nd2 Rf2 24.Qxe5 Qxb2+ (nothing infuriates Black's trapped queen more than to have nobody around to blame for the problems of her own creation) 25.Qxb2 Bxh3 26.gxh3 Bg5 27.Qe5 Bxd2+ 28.Kd1 cxb4 29.axb4 Bxb4 30.Be2 and White should consolidate and win.

**23...Bf5 24.Qd1!**

Anand infringes upon Capablanca's patent: Always take the simplest path. Principle: Swap pieces when ahead in material.

**24...e4 25.Qxb3 axb3 26.Nd2 e3 27.Nf3 Rae8 28.Kd1**

Now comes a frantic battle to blockade the armada, as Shirov's pawns move closer and closer to their promotion squares.

Another path to consolidation lies in 28.Bb5 Rc8 29.Be5 cxb4+ 30.Kb2 Rc2+ 31.Kxb3 bxa3 32.Rxa3 Rxg2 33.Nd4 when Black's passers are blockaded.

**28...c4**

Shirov continues to make a fight of it. The passer's power feels like it radiates over a featureless landscape without end. In truth, formidable as they appear, they are no match for two extra pieces. Still, Anand is forced to play precisely to consolidate.

**29.Be2 Be4 30.Kc1!**

Intending to unravel with Bc3 and Kb2.

**30...Re6!**

Going after g2.

30...Bd3 is met with 31.Rg4 g6 32.Kd1 .

**31.Bc3 Rg6 32.Rh2 Bd3 33.Bxd3!**

Confidently calculated. Anand worked out a blockading plan.

**33...cxd3 34.Kb2**

At last, White's dormant a1-rook emerges.

**34...d2 35.Kxb3 Rg3 36.Kb2?!**

Black's swarm continues to fray the white king's nerves.

36.Kc2! , intending Kd3, looks more logical. Why not use the king's services to help out in the blockade? Anand admitted, "Yes, Kc2 is quicker. I guess I was getting nervous!" in ChessBase Magazine.

**36...g5 37.Kc2!**

Better late than never. To admit an error is the mark of a flexible mind. Anand realizes his last move was inaccurate and switches to the correct plan.

**37...Rc8**

37...g4 38.Nd4 Rf2 39.Rah1 e2 40.Kxd2 e1=Q+ 41.Kxe1 Rxc3 42.Ne2! leaves White up a rook.

**38.Kd3 g4 39.Be5!**

Stronger than 39.Ne5 d1=Q+ 40.Rxd1 Rxc3+ 41.Kxc3 e2+ 42.Kd2 exd1=Q+ 43.Kxd1 Rxa3 44.Nxg4 which should also win for White.

**39...Rc1 40.Rh1 Rxg2 41.Nh4!**

Black's initiative looks as dry and unappealing as last week's loaf of bread.

The passer's arduous trek is at an end after 41.Nh4! Rxa1 42.Rxa1 d1=R+ 43.Rxd1 Ra2 44.Kxe3 . --- SUMMARY: Shirov's piece sac, initiated with 13...a4!? looks sound. Still, I prefer the calmer path 13...b6! intending 14...Ba6, with equality and possibly even an edge for Black.<skip start="14...Ba6"/>

1-0

### (28)Lalic, B.   --   Speelman, J. 12: Hastings Premier, England  2000   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.Nce2 c5 6.c3 Nc6 7.f4 Qb6 8.Nf3 Be7**

Black holds off on ...f6, keeping White wondering if he will play it or not.

**9.g3**

In the next game, we will look at 9.a3 .

**9...a5!?**

Speelman wilfully infringes the position's normal plan. --- QUESTION: Why does Black play ...a5 when White isn't even threatening to play b4? --- ANSWER: Since White tossed in g3, playing ...f6, in a sense plays into White's hands since it allows Bh3, attacking e6. In this instance, Black refuses to oblige with ...f6 and instead seeks to make territorial gains on the queenside with ...a4.

**10.h4**

Let's have a look at the alternatives: 10.Bh3 a4 11.O-O O-O 12.Kh1 a3 13.b3 cxd4 14.cxd4 Ndb8!? 15.Nc3 Nb4 16.Be3 Bd7 17.g4 Qa6! (intending to spoil White's attacking fun with ...Qd3 next) 18.Ne1 N8c6 , C.Tesik-A.Illner Budapest 2012. Black looks fine since 19.f5?! is met with 19...f6 when White's position begins to reach the cusp of overextension.

10.a4 O-O 11.Bh3 cxd4 12.cxd4 f6!? ( Black can also consider 12...Ndb8!? as seen in the above variation ) 13.Bxe6+ Kh8 14.exf6 Bb4+ 15.Nc3 Nxf6 16.Bxc8 Re8+ 17.Kf2 Bxc3 18.bxc3 Raxc8 and Black has more than enough compensation for the pawn. He owns the e4-square and the c3-pawn is weak, L.Gorin-S.Volkov, Bydgoszcz 2000.

**10...a4 11.Bh3 Ndb8!?**

A stunning theoretical novelty! Jon Speelman, one of the most original chess-thinkers of our time, has the disconcerting habit of filling his head with impossible, nonsensical fantasy and then somehow transforming fiction into a reality. Nimzowitsch would approve of this bizarre idea. Speelman strives to reroute and activate his worst-placed piece via a6 or c6. --- QUESTION: Can Black get away with such a flagrant violation? --- ANSWER: He can, as long as the position remains closed. Also, let's remember that White indulged in an awful lot of non-developing pawn pushes earlier in the game. So Speelman's idea feels justified.

Previously played was 11...cxd4 12.cxd4 a3 13.b3 f5 14.h5 h6 15.Kf2 O-O 16.Be3 Ndb8 There it is again! 17.g4 fxg4 18.Bxg4 Bd7 19.Qd3 Nb4 20.Qg6 and I don't like Black's game since Rag1 and f5 are in the air, creating great danger to Black's king, M.Holeksa-T.Sedlacek, correspondence 1997.

**12.h5!?**

Played to prevent ...h5. This move may be the seed of White's coming difficulties.

Lalic criticized his last move, claiming that 12.O-O was superior. --- QUESTION: Why was he afraid to castle during the game? --- ANSWER: Lalic may have feared the blocking plan 12...h5 but in his analysis he pointed out the plan 13.Kg2 followed by a future g4, prying open the kingside. Let's take a look at a possible scenario: 13...g6 14.Rh1 Bd7 15.g4 cxd4 16.cxd4 hxg4 17.Bxg4 Nd8 18.Rb1 Bb5 and the bishop, having performed a miracle, falls to his knees to give thanks for its emergence. After 19.Nc3 Nbc6 20.Be3 Qa6 21.Nxb5 Qxb5 22.Ng5 a3 23.bxa3 Qa4 24.Rb3 Na5 25.Rd3 Qxd1 26.Bxd1 Nc4 27.Bf2 Bxa3 28.h5 gxh5 29.Rdh3 Be7 30.a4 Rg8 31.Rxh5 Kd7 32.Kf3 , Houdini rates this position at dead even.

**12...cxd4 13.cxd4 Bd7 14.O-O Na5**

Black slowly unravels his queenside congestion.

**15.Nc3**

Let's look at the players' alternate suggestions: 15.b3!? which looks incorrect to me since it violates the principle: Don't engage the opponent on his or her strong wing.

Speelman, on the other hand, preferred 15.f5 exf5 16.Nc3 with a double attack on a4 and d5. Following 16...Qc6 17.Bg2 , at this point I would diverge from the Speelman's suggested 17...Be6 ( and try 17...a3 18.Nh4 Bxh4 19.Nxd5 Bxg3 20.Qd3 Bh4 21.b4 ( 21.Nf6+? wins the queen but leaves Black with a winning position after 21...gxf6 22.Bxc6 Nbxc6 with three minor pieces and a coming attack for the queen ) 21...Qc4 22.Qxc4 Nxc4 23.Nc7+ Ke7 24.Nxa8 Nc6 25.Nc7 Nxd4 26.Bxb7 Nxe5 when Black gets full compensation for the exchange. )

**15...Nc4**

The knight swings from tree to tree in Tarzan fashion. Speelman wisely declines to castle, reasoning that his king actually remains safer in the centre.

**16.f5!**

An absolutist is one who never settles for a cheap substitute of the genuine item.

White correctly offers b2, since protecting with 16.Qe2?! loses the initiative after 16...Nc6 17.Qf2 Qa5 (intending ...a3) 18.a3 h6 19.g4 Qb6 20.Rb1 ( 20.f5?? is met with 20...N6xe5! 21.Nxe5 Nxe5 when White is unable to recapture due to ...Bc5 ) 20...N6a5 and Black's queenside attack assumes form faster than White's kingside attempts, mainly since Black's king hasn't committed himself.

**16...Nxb2 17.Qe2 a3 18.f6**

Thematic.

White can also try 18.fxe6 fxe6 19.Rb1 Nc6 20.Kg2 Qa5 21.Bxb2 axb2 22.Qxb2 O-O 23.Qxb7 Qxc3 24.Qxd7 Rxf3! 25.Bxe6+ Kh8 26.Rxf3 Rxa2+ 27.Kh3 ( 27.Rf2 Rxf2+ 28.Kxf2 Qc2+ 29.Kf3 Nxd4+ 30.Kg4 Qe2+ 31.Kh3 Qxh5+ 32.Kg2 Qe2+ is perpetual check ) 27...Qxf3 28.Qxe7! Qg2+ 29.Kh4 Qh2+ 30.Kg4 Qe2+ with perpetual check.

**18...gxf6**

EXERCISE (critical decision): How should White pursue his attacking ambitions? He can play 19 exf6, opening attacking lines, or he can gamble with the piece sac 19 Nxd5. Only one path is correct.

**19.exf6?**

Now White's impossible dream virtually disappears. The move strips White's position of much of its glamour and doubt about White's attacking efficiency flies about like sparks from a hammered anvil. After this serious strategic error, White's initiative, which by now resembles discount bulk rate chewing gum, quickly loses its flavour. White's last move opens the g-file for Black, enables ...Bd6, and plugs up the f-file. White is in too deep to play it safe here. He must continue with the line-opening sac.

ANSWER: 19.Nxd5! exd5 20.exf6 Qxf6 21.Bg5 Qd6 22.Rae1 Qxg3+ 23.Bg2 Be6 24.Bxe7 Kxe7 and the king strikes out alone, entering an uncaring world. However, White has the dangerous riposte 25.Ng5! Qxg5 26.Rxf7+! Kd8 (forced) 27.Qxe6 Ra6 and the position is absolutely unclear and anyone's game after 28.Qh3 Nc4 29.Rf5 Qd2 30.Rxd5+ Rd6 31.Qh4+ Kc7 32.Rc5+ Rc6 33.Bxc6 bxc6 (Black threatens ...Rg8+) 34.Qg3+ Nd6 35.Re7+ Kc8 36.Qg4+ . Black's harried king hasn't seen his ex-wife for quite a while and wishes he could extend not seeing her ad infinitum. Following 36...Kd8 37.Re6 Kc7 38.Qg7+ Nd7 , Houdini rates this mess at 0.00.

**19...Bd6!**

Speelman cleverly 'hangs' the d5-pawn. Black's king looks safe and he is up a pawn with the superior attack.

**20.Bh6**

20.Nxd5? fails to the dirty trick 20...Qb5! 21.Qxb5 Bxb5 22.Re1 Nd3 23.Re4 Bxg3 .

**20...Nc6?!**

This move may allow White back into the game.

More accurate is 20...Rg8! 21.Bg7 Nc6 when 22.Nxd5 is met with 22...Nxd4 23.Nxb6 Nxe2+ 24.Kg2 Nxg3! 25.Nxa8 Nxh5 26.Kf2 Bc6 with the advantage to Black in the ending.

**21.Kh1?**

Now Black's initiative gets out of control.

White had to take the plunge with 21.Nxd5! Nxd4 22.Nxb6 Nxe2+ 23.Kg2 ( 23.Kf2 is met with 23...Bc5+ 24.Be3 Bxb6 25.Bxb6 Nc3 ) 23...Rg8 24.Nxa8 Rxg3+ and the aloof and taciturn king is rousted from his comfort zone with 25.Kf2 . After 25...Bb5 26.Rfd1! Nxd1+ 27.Rxd1 Nc3 28.Rxd6 Ne4+ 29.Ke1 Nxd6 30.Nc7+ Kd8 31.Nxb5 Nxb5 32.Ng5 Ke8 33.Bf1 Rb3! 34.Ne4 Rb1+ 35.Kf2 Kd7 , White may yet hold the game.

**21...Nxd4**

White's centre falls apart.

**22.Qe3 Bc5 23.Bg7 Nf5 24.Qg5 h6!**

Also crushing is 24...Be3! 25.Qg4 Rg8 .

**25.Nxd5**

An error in a losing position, after which White has maxed out all his credit card limits.

However, after 25.Qg4 Ne3 26.Nxd5 Nxd5 27.Bxh8 O-O-O , White is up the exchange but totally busted since Black's threats include ...Rxh8 and ...Ne3.

**25...hxg5 26.Nxb6 Rxh5**

The rook views h3 as a fragment of paradise. White's king remains oblivious to the situation which remains clear to all those around him: He has only moments to live.

**27.Nxa8 Rxh3+**

For White, the landscape is one of blighted dreams and deceased hope. The sagging state of White's unfortunate king suggests that his worthless defenders aren't keeping up their part of their job-description. The remainder of the game reminds us of a mystery novel, where seven or eight people (besides the original victim) are murdered, before the hero detective cracks the case.

**28.Kg2 Rxg3+ 29.Kh2 Bd6**

The d6-bishop, along with his ruthless confederates, approach their target unencumbered by concepts of right or wrong.

29...Bd6 30.Kh1 (the king's hiding place is discovered, mainly due to the loud, convulsive chattering of his teeth) 30...g4 31.Ng5 Bc6+ and the evidence is presented and the white king's guilt remains incontrovertible. "Our bargain was that I would be spared upon surrendering," White's king reminds the c6-emissary who responds, "I'm afraid you have been misinformed upon the matter, Your Grace." --- SUMMARY: When White enters 9 g3, you may consider 9...a5, avoiding 9...f6 (which weakens the e6-pawn). Black simply refuses to cooperate on the kingside, while pursuing expansion on the queenside.

0-1

### (29)Arakhamia, K.   --   Volkov, S. 13: Monarch Assurance Open, Port Erin  2000   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6**

King's Gambit: 1...e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 d5 5.e5 Nh5 6.d4 g5 7.Bd3 .

**2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.Nce2 c5 6.c3 Nc6 7.f4 Qb6 8.Nf3 a5!?**

QUESTION: How is this different from last game? --- ANSWER: This is sort of an accelerated version of what we looked at in the previous game. Black puts off both ...f6 and ...Be7 and pursues a queenside expansion policy, keeping White in the dark about when and if he will toss in either move.

**9.a3**

White's most common response, which eliminates ...Bb4+ ideas and also halts Black's ...a4-a3 plan. --- QUESTION: But doesn't the move also weaken White's queenside light squares? --- ANSWER: It does. White gambles that she can get to Black's king before she loses control of the queenside.

Let's look at a couple of alternatives: 9.g3 a4 10.Bh3 cxd4 11.cxd4 a3 and now we see the problem of White refusing to comply with a3. Black plays the move himself, weakening White's queenside dark squares. After 12.b3 Bb4+ 13.Kf2 Ndb8 14.Be3 Bd7 15.g4 h5 16.gxh5 Rxh5 17.Bf1 Ne7 18.Ng3 Rh8 19.Rc1 Nbc6 (finally, Black managed to untangle his knights) 20.h4 O-O-O! , I like Black's position since his king looks rather safe on the queenside. White lacks a pawn storm there and his pieces are on the other side of the board, A.Khalifman-S.Volkov, St Petersburg 1999.

9.f5 exf5!? ( Black is better off playing 9...cxd4! 10.fxe6 fxe6 11.cxd4 Be7 12.a3 O-O! 13.Nf4 Rf7! when the e6-pawn isn't really hanging, since 14.Nxe6?? is met with 14...Ndxe5 ) 10.Nf4 Ne7 and I don't like Black's position, which looks too tangled for one measly pawn, E.Lobron-S.Volkov, Internet (blitz) 2004.

**9...a4**

Risky as it is, Volkov follows through with his plan of queenside aggression, mixed with kingside inaction.

**10.h4**

Arakhamia follows the Anand-Shirov game plan, essentially ignoring Black's queenside build-up.

**10...Ra7!?**

A bizarre new move in the position. --- QUESTION: What the hay!? This almost looks like a random move. What is the point? --- ANSWER: I think Volkov anticipates a (distant future!) Nc7 fork. He continues to leave White in the dark about how he plans to set up on the kingside. Of course, the obvious downside to his plan is that he loses his main benefit of the line - his developmental lead.

Black can also try the Speelmanesque 10...Ndb8!? when after 11.g3 Bd7 12.Bh3 Na5 , White can never resist after our queenside provocations whip them into an attacking fury with 13.f5!? exf5 14.Nf4 Nb3 15.Rb1 Be6 and the burden of proof is on White, M.Pavlovic-M.Ruf, Bern 1989. 16.c4 is met with 16...cxd4 17.cxd5 Qa5+ 18.Nd2 Bxd5 19.O-O g6 20.Nxd5 Qxd5 21.Bg2 Qb5 22.Nxb3 axb3 23.Bf4 when Rf3 is threatened and White may have full compensation for two pawns.

**11.f5!?**

A natural attacker can only gaze upon such a position with jaundiced eyes. So White distributes sac'ed pawns impartially to all in need, with a lavish hand. GM Neil McDonald writes in Chesspublishing.com: "Naturally an aggressive player like Arakhamia cannot resist these provocations. On the other hand, Black has three pieces in play (four if you envisage a role for the rook on a7!) and White only two, so why exactly should Black be mated by the attack?" He in fact, is saying that Black may look like he is behind in development, but he really isn't.

**11...exf5 12.Nf4 cxd4 13.cxd4**

Black leads in development and looks better after 13.Nxd5?! Qa5 14.Bb5 dxc3 15.Nxc3 Bc5 16.Qxa4 O-O .

**13...Qa5+!**

A secondary claimant for sole rights to the d5-pawn appears in the background. --- QUESTION: Doesn't this just lose a tempo? --- ANSWER: This check, which appears on the surface as a futile gesture, when examined deeper, contains a drop of poison. Black needs this move to hang on to his extra pawn.

If 13...Qd8?! , White regains her investment with 14.Nxd5 .

**14.Bd2 Qd8 15.Bd3**

Black's clever point: 15.Nxd5 is now met with 15...Ndxe5! which wouldn't have worked if White's bishop had not been induced to d2.

**15...Nb6 16.Qc2 g6 17.h5 g5!**

This leads to psychotic complications which probably favours Black.

The text move is clearly superior to 17...Rg8? 18.hxg6 hxg6 19.Rh7 Be7 20.O-O-O Be6 21.Bb5 and I don't like this position for Black. Houdini rates this as winning for White.

**18.Ne2 f4**

The King's Gambit: Move by move? --- Compare the central and kingside pawn structure the players reached in the game with this King's Gambit game played by the old masters: 1 e4 e5 2 f4 exf4 3 Nf3 Nf6 4 Nc3 d5 5 e5 Nh5 6 d4 g5 7 Bd3, M.Chigorin-J.Miese, Vienna 1903 (see the 1...e5 variation).

**19.Bxh7**

White loses the initiative after this natural grab.

However, if she refuses to take it, then after 19.O-O-O h6 , I prefer Black's chances with the extra pawn.

**19...Nc4!**

Black leaps at the chance of sinking a knight on the c4-square.

**20.Bf5 g4! 21.Ng5!**

One could have sworn this position arose from a King's Gambit.

**21...Qxg5 22.Bxc8 Nxd2?!**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Being armed for combat is not a substitute for vigilance of the enemy's intent. Black has just captured on d2. How did White respond?

22...Rxh5! 23.O-O-O Rxh1 24.Rxh1 Nxd2 25.Qxd2 Ne7 and the bishop is trapped. White is forced into the following sac. 26.Nxf4 Nxc8 27.Rh5 Qd8 28.Rh8 Ne7 29.Nh5 Ng6 30.Nf6+ Ke7 31.Rh1 Qc8+ 32.Kb1 Kd8 33.Nxd5 Qe6 and I like Black's consolidating chances.

**23.Bxb7!**

ANSWER: Zwischenzug. After a few genteel throat clearings, Black didn't get the message. So Arakhamia decided to throw off restraint with a blow to the abdomen.

**23...Ne7**

23...Rxb7 24.Qxc6+ Rd7 25.Qc8+ Ke7 26.Qc5+ Ke6 27.Qc6+ draws by perpetual check.

**24.Qc7**

The queen's patently phony innocence doesn't fool Black's king for a minute. He understands perfectly well that she is up to no good.

**24...Rxb7 25.Qxb7 Nc4?**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Both sides missed a clever combination here. Let's see if you can find it.

Correct was 25...f3 which should logically lead to a draw after 26.Qb5+ Kd8 27.Qa5+ Kd7 28.Qb5+ .

**26.Qa8+?**

This inaccurate move lets Black out.

ANSWER: White missed the discovered attack with 26.Qb8+! Kd7 27.Nxf4! and the knight is immune to the e6+ discovery while Black's king remains in serious danger.

**26...Kd7 27.Qxa4+ Ke6 28.Qa6+ Kf5**

La, la la, la la. The king, who was obviously endowed with nerves of steel, carols a merry tune while under heavy fire on his Sunday stroll in the park.

**29.Ng3+!**

The contempt of the king with regards to his would-be assailants induces rebellion. The f5-square isn't quite the haven of refuge Black's king imagined it to be.

White can opt for a draw after 29.O-O f3 30.Ng3+ Kf4 31.Ne2+ Ke3!? 32.Rae1! fxe2 33.Qa4 Qxh5 34.Rxe2+! Kxe2 35.Qc2+ Ke3 36.Qf2+ Kd3 37.Rd1+ Ke4 38.Re1+ .

**29...fxg3 30.O-O+ Ke4**

As the Jimi Hendrix tune goes - "Stone free, do what I please. Stone free, to ride the breeze". For Black's king, freedom is a commodity in perhaps too large a supply!

**31.Rae1+!?**

Maybe White was playing for the win.

A clearer path to the draw lies in the abridged version of the plan, with 31.Rfe1+! Kf5 ( after 31...Kd3?? , Black's king mistakenly decides the war strategy requires not an army, but a single spy, in the form of himself and finds himself in hot soup after 32.Rad1+ Kc2 33.Qa4+ Kxb2 34.Qb4+ Kc2 35.Qb1+ Kc3 . The energy-deficient king looks as if he stayed up way too late last night and now the ghosts of past revelries haunt him in the present with 36.Rd3# ! ) 32.Rf1+ Ke4 .

**31...Ne3 32.Qe2**

Time failed to soften old resentments, so White's queen has a second go at Black's king.

**32...Rxh5 33.Qc2+ Kxd4**

The new valet looks shady to White's queen and she decides to count the silverware.

**34.Qc3+ Ke4 35.Qc2+ Kxe5 36.Qc7+ Ke6**

EXERCISE (combination alert): How should White continue her attack?

**37.Qxg3??**

Time, assisted by the bungling queen's interference, achieved its goal. Now White's world begins to crumble around her. This time pressure-induced move loses the initiative and allows Black to consolidate.

ANSWER: Correct was the double attack 37.Qb6+! Nc6 38.Rxe3+ Kd7 39.Rc1 and now Black can play 39...Bc5!! 40.Qxc5 Qh6! 41.Qxc6+ ( forced as 41.Kf1? loses to 41...d4 and if 42.Rd3?? Qf4+ mates handily ) 41...Qxc6 42.Rxc6 Kxc6 43.Rxg3 f5 44.Rc3+ Kb5 and Black stands better due to his active king though White should hold the draw here.

**37...Bh6**

Game over. No use for euphemisms. Now White's attack transforms into nothing short of an emphatic disaster, as her discouraged non-attackers go about their business with an almost funereal air: 1. Every Black piece works efficiently (including his king!). --- 2. Black's king is safe, unlike White's. --- 3. Black is up in material.

**38.Qc7 f5**

Giving his king air on f7.

**39.Qb6+ Kf7 40.Rf2 g3**

White does not wait to be demonstrated how after 40...g3 41.Rf3 Rh1+ , his king, who appears about as lively as a wax figure, harbours the awful intuition that "the times, they are a-changing". After 42.Kxh1 Qh4+ , Black's queen informs the king, "Your usefulness is at an end and like any redundant thing, the time has come to discard you." and she proceeds to pull the plug with 43.Kg1 Qh2# mate! --- SUMMARY: Volkov's 8...a5!? plan involves queenside aggression, mingled with kingside lethargy! Although obviously risky, it may throw some of your opponents off and thus is possibly worth a try.

0-1

### (30)Macieja, B.   --   Ivanchuk, V. 14: FIDE World Championship, Moscow  2001   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.Nce2 c5 6.f4 Nc6 7.c3 Be7**

Ivanchuk holds back on ...Qb6. To my mind, this may be Black's sneakiest and best move order in the chapter. --- QUESTION: But won't the game simply transpose when Black plays ...Qb6 later on? --- ANSWER: It would but this is under the assumption that Black will play the move, which he may or may not. --- QUESTION: What would be the point of holding back on ...Qb6? --- ANSWER: If we briefly review the Anand-Shirov game from earlier in the chapter, Shirov retreated his queen from b6 to c7. In this case, Ivanchuk may be trying to reach the same position a full move up. --- QUESTION: Why does Black sometimes move the queen back to c7 in this line? --- ANSWER: Two reasons: 1. Black may opt to develop the c8-bishop with ...b6 and ...Ba6 (this plan was suggested in the notes to the Anand-Shirov game). In order to do so, the queen must be removed from b6. --- 2. If you recall, Shirov retreated his queen to c7 to set up a piece sac on e5. Imagine what Shirov could have done if he was handed a full tempo in that game.

**8.Nf3 O-O 9.a3**

I just have a feeling it's a bad idea to take the Anand-Shirov route.

Perhaps, White should veer away with 9.g3! cxd4 10.cxd4 . Black can take advantage of the tempo saved in eschewing...Qb6 by occupying the square with his knight, playing it in Leningrad Tarrasch fashion with 10...Nb6!? 11.Bg2 a5 ( I would play 11...f5 first ) 12.O-O a4 13.g4 a3 14.bxa3?! , B.Socko-M.Gurevich, Venaco 2005. ( Instead, White should probably have opted for 14.b3 Bd7 ( Black can also consider 14...f5!? 15.gxf5 Rxf5 16.Bh3 Rf8 17.Ng5 Bxg5 18.fxg5 Bd7 ) 15.Ng3 Nb4 16.f5 Bb5 17.Rf2 Nd7 18.f6 gxf6 19.Qd2 fxe5 20.Qh6 Kh8 21.Ng5 Bxg5 22.Bxg5 f6 23.Nh5 Qe7 24.Nxf6 Qg7 25.Nxd7 Rxf2 26.Kxf2 Qxh6 27.Bxh6 Bxd7 28.dxe5 Rc8 . I prefer Black's chances in this ultra-sharp ending, despite White's bishop pair, dark-square control and potential for back rank tactics. This is because: 1. He ties White down to the defence of the a2-pawn. --- 2. Black's rook may infiltrate down the open c-file (as long as Black's king doesn't get back rank mated!). --- 3. Black's bishop can control the f1-square with ...Bb5. )

**9...a5**

Halting b4 and preparing the standard bind with ...a4 and a future ...Na5.

**10.h4?!**

An ill-advised project. Why labour to fix an elementally dysfunctional line? I repeat that emulating the Anand-Shirov game plays into Black's hands.

White can consider the following alternatives: GM Neil McDonald suggests 10.Ng3 though my preference is for Black following 10...f5 11.exf6 Nxf6 12.Bd3 Qb6 13.Bc2 cxd4 14.cxd4 Bd6 15.Qd3 Bd7 16.Bd2 Rac8 and White looks somewhat tied down, having to worry about the b2-, d4- and f4-pawns, E.Paehtz-D.Swiercz, Potsdam 2012. If 17.O-O , Black has 17...e5! and if White bites with 18.fxe5? Nxe5 19.Nxe5 Bb5! wins material.

I think White's best is once again to stay far away from Anand-Shirov territory with 10.g3! a4! (I believe this is an improvement over other moves) 11.Kf2 b6 and Black intends ...Ba6 with a decent position.

**10...f6 11.Neg1?!**

The blame for White's coming deterioration can be laid at this move's door. Macieja's high opinion of his position's likelihood for success doesn't seem to be justified by the actual facts. The plan, however pedigreed with precedent, also contains a serious blemish. White, apparently enamoured with the Anand-Shirov game, may not realize he is headed there a full move down. Here, it's even worse since Black returns to the ...Qb6 plan, vindicated by the knowledge that the d4-pawn is weak. But it doesn't really matter which way he plays.

I can't find a way to avoid the move-down scenario! For example: After 11.Rh3 , Black can play 11...b6! to reach a suggested line from Anand-Shirov a move up.

Also, 11.b3 Qc7 ( 11...b6 looks good as well ) 12.Be3 b6 13.Neg1 Ba6 14.Bxa6 Rxa6 15.Ne2 cxd4 16.cxd4 b5 17.O-O a4 leaves White stuck with a bad bishop and no semblance of a kingside attack, while Black exerts his ambitions on the queenside, F.Volkmann-T.Luther, Austria 2008. Still, both alternatives look better than White's choice in the game.

**11...cxd4 12.cxd4 Qb6!**

A novelty at the time, displaying Ivanchuk's remarkable understanding of the position. --- QUESTION: Should this move be give an "?!" since Ivanchuk reverts to the Anand-Shirov game? --- ANSWER: On the contrary, the move is an exclam for such flexibility of mind. This isn't the same position as Anand-Shirov, mainly due to White's premature Neg1. The trouble is not only is d4 weak, but Black threatens an accelerated version of Shirov's ...Nxe5-sac. Just watch.

**13.Bd3**

This move allows Black his intention but I don't know what else to suggest.

**13...fxe5 14.fxe5 Ndxe5!**

Thematic and powerful. Ivanchuk gets Shirov's sac but a greatly superior version on steroids.

**15.dxe5 Nxe5 16.Bc2**

Black stands better in any case: Houdini suggests 16.Nh3 Nxf3+ 17.gxf3 e5 18.Ng5 Bxg5! 19.hxg5 e4 20.Be2 exf3 which doesn't inspire confidence. Black looks better since his attacking chances clearly outweigh White's extra piece.

Of course not 16.Nxe5?? since 16...Qf2# isn't much of a consideration.

**16...Bd7**

The deeper we analyse, the more numerous the contradictions we discover in White's position. For the piece Black gets: 1. Two central pawns. --- 2. Punctures on g4, g3, f2, and e3. --- 3. Open c- and f-files for his rooks. --- 4. A massive developmental lead. --- 5. White's king stuck in the centre. --- 6. Numbers one through five mean Black also receives an endless attack for a tiny investment.

Note that 16...Ng4?! is met with 17.Qd4 with a double attack on the b6-queen and g4-knight. Swapping queens isn't in Black's best interest here.

**17.Qe2 Rac8 !**

EXERCISE (critical decision): No time for White to brood over past folly. His already difficult position impels zero leeway for error. His choices: a) Accept the gift with 18 Nxe5. --- b) Decline and continue developing with 18 Be3. --- c) First toss in 18 Bxh7+ Kxh7 and then follow with 19 Qxe5. --- Which one would you play?

Ivanchuk's move looks clearer than allowing White complications with 17...Ng4 18.Ng5 .

**18.Bxh7+?**

A move which fails to avert the coming peril. This sharp retort was better left unsaid. Macieja gets boggled with the overwhelming defensive task ahead of him.

If White continues to accept all sacs with 18.Nxe5?! , he runs into 18...Bxh4+! 19.Kd1 Ba4!! and if 20.Bxa4 Qd4+ 21.Qd2 Rf1+ 22.Ke2 Rf2+ 23.Kd1 Rxc1+! mates.

ANSWER: White must endeavour to be less trusting and work on easing queenside congestion. The key to survival is: 18.Be3! Qxb2! 19.Ra2! ( 19.Bxh7+?? Kxh7 20.Qxb2 Nd3+ and Black regains the queen with a winning position ) 19...Qc3+ 20.Bd2 Qc4! when Black remains better but White still hangs in there.

**18...Kxh7 19.Qxe5**

The queen senses danger all around her, like a cat out of her normal neighbourhood, walking in an unfamiliar alley.

**19...Bd6!**

The queen reads impertinence in the bishop's body language. Meanwhile, the bishop clears his throat, harrumphing in disapproval at the queen's liberties. The attack works on maximum efficiency plus minimum effort, with each attacking unit spare and functional. Target: g3. Black has only one pawn for the piece and yet still boasts a winning attack.

**20.Be3**

20.Qh5+ Kg8 21.Ne2 Rc4! leaves White curiously helpless against the threat of ...Re4 followed by ...Bb5.

**20...Qb3 21.Nd2**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Ivanchuk found a beautiful combination here. Take your time on this one. For now, the solution appears enshrouded in an obscuring mist. Where is it?

Equally hopeless were: 21.Qxd6 Qxe3+ 22.Ne2 Rc2

and 21.Qd4 Bg3+ 22.Bf2 e5 23.Qd2 Rc2 .

**21...Rf1+!!**

ANSWER: Deflection/overload. The rook approaches the heavily guarded f1-square, almost against his will, propelled by some irresistible urge of the subconscious. --- A devious idea forms in Ivanchuk's mind, like a bubble rising to the surface of a pond.

**22.Kxf1**

After 22.Nxf1 , the knight draws the short straw, as it is assigned the unpleasant task of defending the undefendable since 22...Bxe5 picks up the queen.

22.Ke2 Bb5+ forces mate in two moves.

**22...Qd3+!**

"In the past, you caused my heart to bleed. So now I shall be requiring some of your blood to repay the debt," Black's queen hisses in the king's ear. Black's point is: White's queen hangs, while his doesn't.

**23.Kf2**

As a kid, your writer was not the best of citizens in the school environment. As a result, I was hauled into the dreaded principal's office on many an occasion. One sign of the principal's power was there were no chairs behind his large, intimidating desk. So the penitent was forced to stand, while the red-faced principal lectured upon your unfortunate writer's woeful standards of behaviour. --- QUESTION: Does this story have a point? --- ANSWER: I'm getting to it! Black's queen is the principal, while White's king is your unfortunate writer, standing behind his desk.

**23...Bxe5**

Black is up material and continues to attack. White can resign here.

**24.Ngf3 Bxb2 25.Rab1 Rc2 26.Rhd1 e5 27.g3 Bg4**

. That was one pin too many for White. --- SUMMARY: This is the line I intend to play as Black. I like the idea of holding back on ...Qb6 by playing 7...Be7. Who knows, we may be able to dupe some of our opponents into positions similar to the Anand-Shirov game but with a full move up. Just imagine what we can do with an extra tempo in such a sharp position!

### (31)3: Poisoned Pawn Line   --   ? ? ????   \* (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**8.--**<fen value="r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3N1P2/2N1B3/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8"/>

When I was five years old, it always enraged me if one of my misguided kindergarten colleagues made the outrageously unscientific claim that Santa Claus was a giant hoax perpetrated by the adults of the world. Well, in this line, we must once again believe in Santa, whom I assure you, is very real and ready to bring us gifts, like White's b2-pawn. I normally stroke my moustache craftily, like an old school villain, as I play 8...Qb6!?

, which I admit is a bit odd, since I don't have a moustache. This is a line which will infuriate most of our opponents, yet to my mind is perfectly sound for Black, despite outrageous appearances. We must always keep in mind that positions like this may be beyond our powers of computation - but not when we are still within book and remain under the protection of our big brothers' comps. If you do your homework, I assure you, Black is okay in the Poisoned Pawn Line which to my knowledge, has never been covered in detail in any previous French Defence book. That in itself is an added bonus, because your opponents will likely be bumped from their book knowledge very quickly in this line, while ours extends to around move 20 (but only if we do our homework!).<fenend/>

### (32)Georgiev, K.   --   Ehlvest, J. 15: Reggio Emilia, Italy  1989   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qb6**

The gateway position into that dark science, the Classical French Poisoned Pawn Line. Black's queen attacks the b2-pawn and also exerts pressure on the d4-knight, which for now is semi-pinned, only having access to the useless f5-square. --- QUESTION: Is this meant to be funny? Isn't it somewhat counterintuitive for Black's queen to walk headlong into the e3-bishop's stare? --- ANSWER: It certainly is but this doesn't mean the line is bad for Black. In fact the current state of theory at the highest levels suggests that it is White who experiences difficulty in maintaining an edge. At the time of this writing (be careful though, some super GM may refute it a week after you purchase this book!) I can confidently state the line is sound. In fact, the top-ranked US (and perennial world's top-ten player) GM Hikaru Nakamura uses it as a drawing weapon!

**9.Qd2**

The principled continuation. Just as in the Najdorf Sicilian Poisoned Pawn Line, White offers the b2-pawn for a scary developmental lead. --- QUESTION: Does White have to offer the sac? --- ANSWER: No.

At the end of the chapter, we will examine the declined lines with 9.a3

9.Be2 (when taking on b2 is unfavourable for Black)

and 9.Ncb5 .

**9...Qxb2**

"B" tends to follow "A". We accept White's challenge and dare our opponents to do their worst.

**10.Rb1 Qa3 11.Bb5**

This counterintuitive move is White's best. --- QUESTION: It appears to me that Black is in danger if White moves either knight to b5. Am I wrong about this assessment? --- ANSWER: Both moves, although exceedingly tempting, give White nothing.

Let's take a look: On the surface 11.Ncb5 , looks crushing, since Black's queen is attacked and White also threatens the c7-fork. However, Black has 11...Qxa2 attacking the rook: ( 12.Rb3 Qa1+ 13.Ke2 ( 13.Kf2? Nc5! threatens a king/queen fork on e4 and also ...Nxb3 ) 13...Rb8 14.Nc7+ Kd8 15.Ncxe6+!? fxe6 16.Nxe6+ Ke7!? ( 16...Ke8 17.Nc7+ Kd8 18.Ne6+ is drawn ) 17.Qxd5 Qa5 18.Rb5 , E.Liu-C.Lakdawala, San Diego (rapid) 2004. Houdini rates the position at dead even after 18...Qc3 19.Kf2 Qxc2+ 20.Kg1 . ) ( 12.Rd1 Rb8 13.Nc7+ Kd8 14.Ncb5 a6 15.Nd6 Bxd6 16.exd6 Qa3 and Black is about to pick up a second pawn. The burden of proof is on White to prove full compensation, M.Duckworth-C.Lakdawala, California, 1988. Houdini rates this as nearly even, while I favour Black. )

After 11.Ndb5 Qa5 , we examine: ( 12.Be2? a6 13.Nd4 only results in two wasted White moves. Following 13...Bb4 ( also favourable for Black is 13...Nxd4 14.Bxd4 Bc5 15.O-O Bxd4+ 16.Qxd4 Qc5 with a clean pawn up for zero compensation in the coming ending ) 14.Nxc6? ( correct was 14.Nb3 Qc7 ) 14...bxc6 15.Bd4 ( 15.Rb3 Nc5 16.Bxc5 Qxc5 is also hopeless for White ) 15...c5 16.Rxb4 Qxb4 17.Bf2 , White had absolutely no compensation for his material deficit, A.Krishnan-C.Lakdawala, San Diego (rapid) 2013. ) ( . The combination 12.Nxd5! produces only a dynamically balanced game after 12...Qxd2+ 13.Kxd2 exd5 14.Nc7+ Kd8 15.Nxa8 b6 (the a8-knight is trapped) 16.Be2 ( 16.Bb5 Bb7 17.Nxb6 axb6 18.Bxc6 Bxc6 19.Bxb6+ Nxb6 20.Rxb6 Kc7 21.Rhb1 Bc5 is dynamically balanced ) 16...d4 17.Bf2 Bb7 18.Nxb6 Nxb6 19.c3 Bc5 20.Rhd1 Kc7 21.cxd4 Bxd4 22.Ke1 , M.Zayats-C.Lakdawala, Internet (blitz) 2005. Black looks at least even after 22...Bxf2+ 23.Kxf2 Ne7 . )

**11...Nxd4**

The main line and the logical move, since every swap gets us closer to a pawn-up ending.

GM Josef Klinger's bizarre unravelling move 11...Ndb8!? is exceedingly dangerous to attempt. After 12.O-O! , both 12...Bb4 ( and 12...a6 13.f5! ) 13.Rb3 Qa5 14.Rfb1 Be7 15.f5! seem too risky to venture.

**12.Bxd4 Bb4**

The old main line.

For the bulk of the chapter we will look at the modern interpretation 12...a6 , which according to current theory, is Black's best move.

**13.O-O**

13.f5 a6 14.Rb3 Qa5 15.a3 was M.Duckworth-C.Lakdawala, Buena Park 1992. Chances are balanced after 15...Bxc3 16.Bxd7+ Bxd7 17.Rxc3 (threatening a discovery cheapo on c8) 17...Qd8 18.f6 gxf6 19.O-O f5 20.Qh6 Rc8 21.Qg7 Rf8 and if 22.Qxh7? , Black takes over the initiative with 22...Rxc3 23.Bxc3 Qg5 24.Bb4 Rg8 .

Switching the order of the attacking motifs with 13.Rb3 Qa5 14.a3 Be7 15.f5 exf5 16.Nxd5 was seen in N.De Firmian-R.Huebner, Polanica Zdroj 1995. Chances look dynamically balanced after 16...Qxd2+ 17.Kxd2 Bg5+ 18.Ke2 Bd8 19.c4 a6 20.Bxd7+ Kxd7!? when White seems to have full compensation for the pawn, even with queens off the board.

**13...a6**

After 13...O-O 14.Rb3 Qa5 15.Qe3 Nb6 16.Qg3 Nc4 , the players agreed to a draw in a position which Houdini rates at 0.00, V.Ivanchuk-A.Dreev, Biel 1993.

**14.Rb3 Qa5 15.Bxd7+?!**

The line at the time was in its infancy. One senses that White veered from the correct plan, the way your car radio station slowly disintegrates to static as you drive from one city to the next. After this inaccuracy, White's initiative is rendered inoperative since he regains the lost pawn but loses the initiative.

We will analyse Georgiev's improvement 15.Rfb1 in the next game.

**15...Bxd7 16.Rfb1 Bc5 17.Rxb7 Rc8!**

The effects of White's 15th move expand in ever widening circles. Black threatens ...Bxd4+, followed by ...Qxc3. White may have regained the lost pawn but his position went downhill by doing so. White's knight remains awkwardly vulnerable on c3 and he also carries the inferior pawn structure.

**18.R1b3 Ba4**

18...Bc6 19.Rb8 O-O 20.Rxc8 Rxc8 21.Bxc5 Qxc5+ 22.Qf2 Be8 23.Qxc5 Rxc5 also looks slightly better for Black, since White must defend the c3-knight and c2-pawn.

**19.Bxc5 Qxc5+ 20.Kh1**

EXERCISE (critical decision): Black enjoys the clearly superior structure, and exerts pressure on the c3-knight and c2-pawn. Should we take the hanging b3-rook?

**20...Qc4!**

Threat: mate on f1. This alert move tarnishes White's magic.

ANSWER: Black should decline the gift. If Black takes the exchange, White slips away with a draw by meeting 20...Bxb3?! with the clever zwischenzug 21.Ne4!! . The goal is to get from point A to point B. How we accomplish it is irrelevant. The knight, a wild mountain goat, leaps from crag to crag, in complete disregard to his safety. After 21...Qxc2 22.Qxc2 Bxc2 , the knight unloads with 23.Nd6+ like a delivery of gravel. Following 23...Kd8 ( 23...Kf8 24.Nxc8 g5 25.Nd6 Bg6 26.fxg5 looks at least even for White, who may eventually pick up a6 ) 24.Nxf7+ Ke8 25.Nd6+ Kd8 26.Nf7+ , the game is drawn by perpetual check.

**21.Rb1 O-O**

Certainly not 21...Qxc3?? 22.Qxc3 Rxc3 23.Rb8+ picking up the exchange.

**22.Nxa4 Qxa4**

We diagnose White's ills: In the aftermath, White nurses weak pawns on a2, c2 and f4.

**23.c3 h6 24.h3 Qc4 25.R1b3 a5**

Worrying White with the potential ...a4 thrust.

**26.Kh2**

White has no way to improve his position and can only wait.

**26...Qe4**

Intending ...Rc4, going after the f4-pawn.

**27.g3?**

The multiple targets contribute to the increasing feelings of pessimism and the virus spreads through White's camp. --- EXERCISE (combination alert): White's last move weakened his king. How can Black exploit this?

White can put up greater resistance with 27.R7b5 Rc4 28.Rxa5 Rfc8 29.Rab5 g5! 30.Rb8 Rxb8 31.Rxb8+ Kg7 32.Kg1 gxf4 33.Rb4 Qxe5 34.Rxc4 dxc4 35.a4 .

**27...Rc4?!**

Ehlvest bypasses the real issue and settles for a cheap substitute.

ANSWER: Attraction. Black breaks down defences with 27...d4! 28.Qxd4 Qe2+ 29.Kg1 Rcd8 30.Rd7 Rxd7 31.Qxd7 a4! 32.Rb4 ( not 32.Qxa4?? Rd8 and White has no defence to the dual threats ...Rd2 and ...Rd1 mate! ) 32...Qf3 33.Qd2 Qxg3+ 34.Qg2 Qe3+ 35.Kh2 Rd8 36.Re4 Qxc3 37.Re2 Rd4 leaving White a pawn short and hopelessly tied down.

**28.h4**

Hoping to discourage ...g5.

**28...Rfc8 29.Rb8 Rxb8 30.Rxb8+ Kh7 31.Rb2 Kg6!?**

Ehlvest's king makes good use of the light-square lanes, just in case the queens come off the board.

**32.Rc2 Qf3 33.Qe1 Qd3!**

Now the c3-pawn falls. A hot spasm of jealousy runs through White's queen, as she views her infinitely more powerful sister.

**34.Rd2**

34.Qc1 a4 35.Kg2 d4 and the c3-pawn is soon abducted without a trace with the search party unable to locate the body.

**34...Qxc3 35.Qd1 Kh7!?**

Opening up possibilities of future ...g5 breaks.

I prefer to secure the kingside light squares with 35...h5 .

**36.h5**

Preventing ...g5 but creating a potential new weakness.

**36...Qe3 37.Rg2 d4**

Finally, Ehlvest prepares to push his passer down the board.

**38.Re2 Qf3 39.Rd2 Qe4 40.Re2 Qf3 41.Rd2 Qe3 ?**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Invariably, we might get a hitch in our plans, derailing them from the perfection we imagined. Black's formally radiant halo begins to dim. His last move was a blunder which allowed White right back into the game. What did he miss?

Correct was 41...Qe4 .

**42.Re2?**

Georgiev squanders a perfect opportunity and turns his back to his best interests.

ANSWER: He missed 42.Qb1+! g6 ( 42...d3 43.Qxd3+ Qxd3 44.Rxd3 Rc2+ 45.Kh3 Rxa2 46.Rd7 Kg8 47.Rd8+ Kh7 48.Rd7 is drawn ) 43.hxg6+ . Most definitely not 43...fxg6?? ( 43...Kg7 44.Rg2 and White equalized, since Black still can't recapture the g6-pawn ) 44.Qb7+ when Black's king gets lectured by White's queen, "Now you don't talk so loud. Now you don't feel so proud," only to realize in embarrassment that she inadvertently quoted a Bob Dylan song. After 44...Kg8 45.Qb8+ Kg7 46.Rb2 Rb4 47.Qc7+ , the queen reassures, "Be of good courage, Your Grace," adding that "We all die eventually." Finally, 47...Kg8 48.Rc2 , the end is nigh as Black's king stares into the unforgiving face of bleak truth: He has no reasonable defence to the coming Qc8+ and Rc7+.

**42...Rc1!**

Black's queen is sick and tired of these tiresome, snippy intellectual exchanges with her sister. So she decides the time has come to switch from words to violence, sending the rook to do her dirty work.

**43.Rxe3 Rxd1 44.Ra3 d3 45.Kg2**

Not 45.Rxa5?? d2 and the pawn promotes.

**45...g6!**

Endgame Principle: Activate your king as quickly as possible.

**46.g4 g5!**

Ehlvest cleverly undermines the e5-pawn.

**47.fxg5 hxg5 48.Kf2 d2 49.Rd3**

White's king and rook strive mightily to intercept the runaway d-pawn, which will soon be swapped away for the one on e5.

**49...Kg7 50.Rd4 Re1 51.Rxd2 Rxe5**

Not only is Black up a pawn, but he can destabilize the h5-pawn with a coming ...f5 break.

**52.Rd4 Rc5 53.Ke3?**

EXERCISE (combination alert): How did Ehlvest pick up a second pawn?

White had to try 53.a4 .

**53...Rc3+**

ANSWER: Generate dual threats on a2 and g4.

**54.Ke4**

54.Kd2 Ra3 picks up the a2-pawn.

**54...Ra3 55.Rd7**

55.Rd2 is met with 55...Rg3 when the g4-pawn falls. White's king sighs at the rook's constant nagging.

**55...Rxa2 56.h6+ Kg6 57.Kf3 Rh2 58.Ra7 Rxh6 59.Rxa5 Rh3+ 60.Kg2 Rc3**

. The ...f5 break is imminent. --- SUMMARY: The old main line 12...Bb4 still looks quite playable for Black.

0-1

### (33)Georgiev, K.   --   Dolmatov, S. 16: GMA Qualifier, Moscow  1990   1/2-1/2   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qb6 9.Qd2 Qxb2 10.Rb1 Qa3 11.Bb5 Nxd4 12.Bxd4 Bb4 13.O-O a6 14.Rb3 Qa5 15.Rfb1**

Georgiev's improvement over his game against Ehlvest, where he took on d7 and lost the initiative. Yet I'm not sure it's enough to extract an edge.

**15...Qxb5!**

We all sense that Black's queen is on the verge of another diatribe.

White gets a tempi-up version over the previous game after 15...Be7 16.Bxd7+ Bxd7 17.Rxb7 .

**16.Rxb4**

QUESTION: Doesn't White win the exchange after 16.Nxb5 ? --- ANSWER: It wins the exchange but since Black snags two pawns and the bishop pair after 16...Bxd2 17.Nc7+ Ke7 18.Nxa8 Bxf4 , he stands at least equal, R.Kuczynski-W.Schmidt, Wroslaw 1987.

**16...Qc6 17.f5!**

QUESTION: Isn't this just bad for Black? It feels to me like White has too much compensation for a pawn here. --- ANSWER: The comps seem to disagree that White has an edge. However, I do concede that Black's position does look a lot harder to play, and is perhaps the reason the old main line has been replaced by 12...a6, which we will look at for the remainder of the chapter. White's advantages for the sac'ed pawn: 1. White's massive developmental lead. --- 2. The presence of opposite-coloured bishops also helps White, who plans to run a dark-square campaign. --- 3. Black's lack of king safety. If he castles kingside, the f6 spike is at hand and White's queen and b4-rook may swing in that direction as well. Still, if you ask the comps, they tell you Black is just fine here!

**17...h6?!**

White may extract an edge from this move, which looks too slow. Black seeks to prevent Qg5 at the cost of further weakening.

Houdini recommends: 17...O-O!? 18.f6 gxf6 19.Qh6 fxe5 20.Bxe5 Nxe5 21.Rh4 Re8 22.Qxh7+ Kf8 23.Qh8+ Ke7 24.Qxe5 Bd7 25.Rf1 Rf8 26.Qf6+ Ke8 27.Rh8 Qc5+ 28.Rf2 Rxh8 29.Qxh8+ Qf8 30.Qe5 Kd8 when White's aggressive position and Black's superior structure lead to a complex and probably balanced game.

QUESTION: Can Black remove the f6 threat with 17...exf5 ? --- ANSWER: I don't think it's advisable. White looks clearly better after 18.Qg5 Qg6 ( 18...O-O 19.e6 f6 20.Qxf5 also looks difficult for Black ) 19.Qxg6 hxg6 20.Nxd5 Rb8 21.Ba7 when White picks up the exchange.

**18.f6**

The once pristine black landscape is marred by the blot on f6.

Thematic, yet White may be better off maintaining pawn tension with 18.Qe3! , planning to swinging it to g3 with unpleasant pressure.

**18...gxf6 19.exf6 Qd6 20.a4**

Preventing ...b5.

**20...b5?!**

Hey, I said: "Preventing ...b5!" Dolmatov doesn't exactly play like a man stricken by remorse, but I suppose growing concerns sometimes impel us to consider risky measures. Black, sick and tired of bearing his defensive burden with fortitude, decides to lash out at his tormentor, returning the extra pawn in exchange for freedom. But this looks like premature desperation to me.

Perhaps Black should delay the move and try 20...h5 . Houdini gives the line 21.a5 Rg8 22.R4b3 b5!? 23.Rxb5! Rb8 24.Rxb8 Nxb8 with only an edge for White.

**21.Rxb5!?**

In an embarrassing misunderstanding, both players seem to believe that b5 is in their possession as they simultaneously plant their respective flags upon the square. A fanciful move, but maybe not best.

White looks clearly better after 21.axb5 e5 22.Bf2 Nxf6 23.Bh4 .

**21...Rg8**

Clearly, the b5-square is ground hallowed by painful associations for Black, who just ignores the rook.

There is no way Black survives 21...axb5?? 22.Nxb5 Qc6 23.Qb4 Nc5 24.Bxc5 when the black king's circle of acquaintances grows noticeably smaller, as the number of enemies grows exponentially.

**22.Re1!**

Threat: Rxd5. Such showmanship. White continues to tempt Black with fruit dangling on b5. When your nervous writer finds himself in such situations similar to White's position, he finds it prudent not to flaunt his incompetence due to the fear of hanging something and steer towards safer routes instead.

A practical player like me would play 22.R5b3 with a sigh of relief.

**22...axb5!?**

Black, seeing a tactical quirk, decides to accept on the second offer and puts his fortunes to the test. So he seeks a middle ground between over-aggression and passive defence.

**23.Nxb5 Qc6 24.Qb4**

Threat: Mate on e7.

**24...Nc5**

No choice in the matter.

**25.Bxc5 Rxa4!**

Only with this counter-shot does Black have a chance to save himself.

**26.Qxa4 Qxc5+ 27.Kh1 Kd8**

EXERCISE (planning): Come up with a clear plan to conduct White's attack.

**28.Qa5+?!**

White confines his thoughts too narrowly in the direction of a non-existent checkmate. This doesn't lead anywhere and walks into a self-pin.

ANSWER: White should transfer his knight to e5, after which Black experiences difficulty in covering the weakened dark squares. For example, after 28.Nd4! Kc7 29.Nf3 h5 30.Qf4+ Qd6 31.Qd4 Qb6 32.Qe5+ Qd6 33.Qxh5 (attacking f7) 33...Rg6 34.Qh4 (with the threat of Ne5 and the knight paws at e5, the way a kitten plays with a ball of wool) 34...e5 35.Nxe5 Rxf6 36.Qd4 , Black won't survive.

**28...Kd7 29.Re3?!**

Previous excavation attempts to remove the annoying queen from c5 haven't gone well. So now White decides the time has come to use dynamite. White executes a clever yet flawed tactic as he goes all out against Black's king.

White should try 29.Qa4 Bb7 30.Nd4+ Bc6 when Black survived the storm to attain equal chances.

**29...Rg4**

The rook swings to the defence. White's threats flow in an unceasing stream, yet Black fends them off, one by one.

White must fight for the draw after 29...d4! 30.Rd3 e5 31.Nxd4 Qxa5 32.Nb3+ Qd5 33.Rxd5+ Ke6 34.Ra5 Kxf6 .

Inadvisable is 29...Qxe3?? 30.Qc7+ Ke8 31.Qe7# mate! The queen has a bad feeling about this romance, thinking, "A relationship between an heiress and a swineherd will never work."

**30.Rc3**

A direct frontal charge represents the most elemental yet least successful military strategy.

**30...Rb4!?**

"How powerful you once thought you were! In retrospect, you were nothing but a nuisance to me, to be casually ignored," Black's queen informs the c3-rook with a condescending laugh. Black's last move creates a nasty mating threat on b1. Clearly, strange changes elapsed in the brief interval of the last few moves. I have a feeling Dolmatov overestimated the power of White's threats.

Even stronger was 30...Rc4! 31.Rxc4 dxc4 when White, down a pawn, finds himself struggling to draw.

**31.g4 Rb1+**

Once again, 31...Rc4! would leave White hard-pressed to hold the game.

**32.Kg2**

The draw is a fitting conclusion as after 32.Kg2 Qg1+ 33.Kh3 (a look of alarm washes over the king's face as Black's hateful queen enters the room) 33...Qf1+ 34.Kg3 (White's king is pleasantly surprised to find himself still alive) 34...Qg1+ leads to perpetual check. --- SUMMARY: Houdini's untried 17...0-0!? may be an improvement over 17...h6.

1/2-1/2

### (34)Leko, P.   --   Nakamura, H. 17: Renova Group Grand Prix, Zug  2013   1/2-1/2   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qb6**

Once again, we attempt to abuse Fate and our opponents in equal measure.

**9.Qd2 Qxb2 10.Rb1 Qa3 11.Bb5 Nxd4 12.Bxd4 a6!**

Black dispenses with ...Bb4 and immediately offers to return the pawn. This move is the modern interpretation of the line, which turns it into - believe it or not - a drawing weapon for Black! But...be careful. This is not a line open to creative interpretation on every move. We must know and understand the comp analysis which now runs past move 20. If you didn't do your homework on time in grade school, this line may not be for you! Too bad in chess, one can't write down the analysis on one's hand, the way Sarah Palin does to remind herself of her talking points during speeches.

QUESTION: What is the point of avoiding ...Bb4, since the move both develops a piece and pins the c3-knight?

ANSWER: The difficulty with ...Bb4 as we saw last game, is that the bishop, far from being a pest on b4, actually provides White with the convenient tempo-gaining manoeuvre Rb3, followed by Rfb1. Black then either must lose a tempo or chop on c3, after which White dominates the dark squares. Now in this version, we delay our dark-squared bishop's development until we play ...Qe7 and ...Qd8!, and only then, develop our bishop to e7. It took theoreticians a quarter of a century to decipher this subtlety. However, now that it's found, White is currently experiencing a devil of a time extracting even a slight edge. So in a sense, the main line of the Poisoned Pawn is perhaps the soundest Black opening in the book (but only if we believe in the comps to keep us alive)!

**13.Bxd7+**

We examine 13.Rb3 in the next two games of the chapter.

**13...Bxd7 14.Rb3!**

This in-between move is White's only shot at an edge. --- QUESTION: Why not take on b7 immediately? --- ANSWER: The immediate capture would have been inaccurate. By first tossing in Rb3, Black's queen is chased to the unfavourable e7-square.

If 14.Rxb7 Bb4 15.O-O Rc8 16.Nb1! (White is lucky to have this resource) 16...Bxd2 17.Nxa3 , Black stands at least even in the ending, due to his bishop pair and the weak c2-target, M.Agopov-J.Jarvenpaa, Jyvaskyla 2007. Play may continue 17...h5 18.Rf2 Ba5 19.Ra7 Ke7 20.Rxa6 Bc3 21.Bxc3 Rxc3 22.Nb1 Re3 23.Ra7 Rc8 24.Nd2! Rxc2 25.Nf3 with an equal ending.

**14...Qe7**

QUESTION: Why not place the queen on the more active a5-square?

ANSWER: I'm begging you not to fall for 14...Qa5?? 15.Bb6 after which our queen is trapped, causing you to bitterly give up the Poisoned Pawn Line and send me an angry email, demanding a refund for the book. No can do. All sales of this book are final!

**15.Rxb7 Qh4+?!**

This check is inaccurate as it provokes White's queen to the stronger f2-square.

Black is walking on eggshells in this line: Also risky is 15...Rc8!? 16.O-O Qa3 when White has the superb reply 17.Rfb1! ( 17.Rb3?! Qa5 18.Qe3 Bc5 19.Ne2 O-O 20.Bxc5 Rxc5 21.Nd4 Rc4 22.Rb7 Bc8 23.Rb2 Qc5 , S.Karjakin-A.Morozevich, Dubai (rapid) 2014 and Black has a slight edge, thanks to the pressure on the c2-pawn ) 17...Bc5 18.Ne2 h6 (to deny White's queen the use of the g5-square after f5 and ...exf5) and White engineers a double pawn sacrifice to force a queen invasion with 19.f5! exf5 20.h3 Bxd4+ 21.Nxd4 Rc4 22.e6! fxe6 23.Qe2! Qe7 ( 23...Rxd4 is not possible due to 24.Qh5+ Kd8 25.Rxd7+ Kxd7 26.Qf7+ Kc8 27.Qxe6+ Kc7 28.Qb6+ Kd7 29.Qxd4 ) 24.Qh5+ Kd8 25.Qe2 e5 ( after 25...Qf6 , Black has no good answer to 26.Nf3! Bc8 27.Ne5! Bxb7 28.Rxb7 and the sad h8-rook will cost Black the game ) 26.Rb8+ Bc8 27.Nxf5 Qc5+ 28.Kh1 Rxc2 29.Rxc8+ Qxc8 30.Qxe5 Rc1+ 31.Kh2 Qc7 32.Rb8+ Kd7 33.Qxc7+ Rxc7 34.Rxh8 and White emerges a piece up with a winning position, C.RodrBguez Amezqueta-T.Baranowski, correspondence 2012.

Safer is 15...Qd8 when top-flight chess praxis has seen: ( 16.f5 Qc8 17.Rb3 Qc4 18.fxe6 fxe6 19.Rf1 Be7 ( I prefer 19...Bb4! 20.a3 Be7 when White must watch over the a3-pawn ) 20.Qd3 Rc8 21.Kd2 Rf8 22.Qxc4 Rxc4 23.Rb8+ Bc8 24.Rxf8+ Bxf8 25.Ne2 Kd7 , S.Karjakin-H.Nakamura, Zug 2013. Black, with the bishop pair and superior pawn structure, already stood a shade better. ) ( 16.O-O Rb8 17.Rxb8 Qxb8 18.f5 (White attempts to batter Black on the kingside) 18...Qc8 19.f6 gxf6 20.Rxf6 h5 (to free up the h7-square for the h8-rook to defend f7 if necessary) 21.Rf3 Qc4 , A.Grischuk-S.Agdestein, Stavanger 2014. Black is holding firm and looking forward to make his bishop pair count. )

**16.Bf2?!**

Missing out on a chance to get the edge.

White can also block the check with 16.Qf2! : ( . Simplifying with 16...Qxf2+ 17.Kxf2 Be7 18.Rhb1 Bd8 19.Rb8 Rxb8 20.Rxb8 O-O 21.Rb7 Bc8 22.Ra7 gives White a nagging edge. ) ( . After 16...Be7 , Karjakin kept the queens on against Agdestein and played to stymie Black's development after 17.g3 Qh3 18.Kd2 Bd8 ( Black will be asking for trouble after 18...Bc8 19.Rxe7+ Kxe7 20.Bc5+ Ke8 21.Re1!! (nullifying the possibility of ...f6 and...Kf7) 21...Bd7 22.Ba3 Rc8 23.Qb6 and Black will get obliterated on the dark squares ) 19.Rhb1 Bc6 20.Bc5! (White has to sacrifice the exchange or Black will castle into safety and consolidate) 20...Bxb7 21.Rxb7 Rc8 , S.Karjakin-S.Agdestein, Stavanger 2014. --- QUESTION: Can you find a powerful move to maximize White's piece activity here? --- ANSWER: Cut off the c7-access square to Black and prepare to invade via the g1-a7 diagonal. 22.Bd6!! Ba5 ( also, 22...Rc6 23.Rb8 places Black in a developmental zugzwang. Even returning the exchange to get into safety does not help as after 23...Rxd6 24.exd6 O-O , White has 25.Rxd8!! Rxd8 26.Qb6 and Black cannot match the White queen and d-pawn tandem ) 23.Kc1!! . An incredibly nonchalant retort to Black's 'counter-attack'. After 23...Rxc3 24.Kb2 and Black is helpless in the face of the white queen infiltration to a7. Hence, it is more circumspect for Black to play 15...Qd8 instead of encouraging White to improve his queen position with 15...Qh4+. )

**16...Qd8 17.Bb6**

17.O-O Qc8 18.Rfb1 Be7?! ( with hindsight, better is 18...Bc6! 19.R7b6 Be7 20.f5 Bd8 21.R6b3 d4! 22.Ne2 exf5 23.Nxd4 Be4 24.Rg3 Bc7 25.Rxg7 Bxe5 and I like Black's position, since his bishops are monsters ) 19.f5 and White looks a shade better, "Jahudor"-C.Lakdawala, Internet (blitz) 2013.

**17...Qc8!**

Black's queen shudders at the thought of yet another visit from her annoying siblings.

17...Qh4+? 18.g3 Qh3 19.Rxd7! Kxd7 20.Nxd5! gave White a ferocious attack, F.Nijboer-S.Kuipers, Dieren 2011.

**18.Rc7 Qd8**

Black's queen is unable to maintain the pretence of being her sister's equal.

QUESTION: Oh, are you kidding?

ANSWER: As a friend, I urge you to cut back on caffeine intake and begin a daily meditation routine. When we enter the line with 8...Qb6, we voluntarily place our queen on the same diagonal as White's dark-squared bishop - just as we do here. We must remember: To navigate a position of such dangerous complexity is beyond the ability of most humans - but not beyond the ability of the comps. This position has been heavily comp-checked. A top player like Nakamura, isn't going to make a move like this unless Houdini, Fritz and the gang have been pulling all-nighters working things through, and seeing that every decimal point sits in its proper location. A position may look optically scary, yet it remains perfectly safe from a comp's eyes. This applies to our current position as well. The only thing required on our part is to do our homework and know the comp analysis cold. Also, if you are a club level player, don't assume your opponents will know this analysis. In fact, the Vegas odds are 99-1 against White knowing what he or she is doing. So this line may be a drawing weapon at Nakamura's level. However, on our level, I'm guessing it will be more of a winning weapon. Our side will fathom the analysis, but our opponents - thank goodness - won't be Lekos!<level/>

Much weaker is 18...Qb8? 19.Qd4 when White threatens the now familiar Rxd7! followed by Nxd5!. After 19...a5?! 20.Rxd7! Kxd7 21.Nxd5! Kc8 , D.Rivera Kuzawka-C.Grushka, La Hora 1985, White remains up material, with attacking chances after 22.Nc7! .

**19.Qd4**

A move seemingly packed with dark layers of menace. This appears unbelievably intimidating but White isn't actually threatening a serious discovery. It's all show, very little substance and the computers declare that Black is doing perfectly fine here.

**19...Ba3**

19...Rc8 20.Rc6 Qh4+ 21.g3 Qe7 22.Rxc8+ Bxc8 looks solid for Black and I even prefer his position here, due to his bishop pair and superior pawn structure, S.Ganguly-T.Batchuluun, Jakarta 2013.

**20.Nb1**

Leko agrees to decentralize his knight to clear the path for the coming c4 break.

After 20.O-O O-O 21.f5 Rc8 , some possibilities are: ( 22.Rxc8 Qxc8 23.f6 Qc4 (this move spoils White's attacking fun) 24.Qxc4 dxc4 25.Rd1 Bc6 26.Rd4 Rb8 27.Ba7 Ra8 28.Bb6 Rb8 and the players drew by repetition of moves, V.Zakhartsov-A.Greenfeld, Dieren 2013. ) ( 22.Ra7 is met with 22...Qxb6! 23.Qxb6 Bc5+ 24.Qxc5 Rxc5 25.Rxd7 Rxc3 26.Rb1 Rxc2 27.fxe6 ( 27.Rbb7 exf5 28.e6 Re2 29.exf7+ Kh8 30.Rxd5 g6 reaches a near-certain draw ) 27...fxe6 28.h3 h6 29.Rbb7 Rff2 30.Rxg7+ Kf8 31.a4 d4 32.Rg4 h5 33.Rb8+ Kf7 34.Rb7+ is perpetual check. )

**20...Be7 21.c4 Rb8**

After 21...Rc8 22.Rxc8 ( 22.Rb7 Bb4+ 23.Kf2 ( 23.Ke2 Qh4 24.Rxd7 Qg4+ 25.Kf2 Kxd7 26.c5 Bxc5 27.Bxc5 Rxc5 28.Qxc5 Qxf4+ 29.Ke2 Qe4+ leads to a draw ) ) 22...Qxc8 , we have the following continuations: ( 23.c5?! and Black stands better after this inaccuracy following 23...f6 24.O-O O-O 25.Nd2 fxe5 26.fxe5 Rxf1+ 27.Kxf1 . Black's bishop pair and multiple pawn targets gave him a clear advantage in the ending, D.Jakovenko-A.Shimanov, Yekaterinburg 2013. ) ( . Correct is 23.Nd2 O-O 24.O-O Bc6 and only then 25.c5 when the position is about equal. ( ) )

**22.Nd2**

22.cxd5? is met with the sneaky 22...Qxc7! 23.Bxc7 Rxb1+ 24.Kf2 Rxh1 25.Qa7 O-O 26.Bb6 Bh4+ 27.g3 Rxh2+ 28.Kf3 Bb5 29.gxh4 Rc8! with an edge to Black in the ending since White's king doesn't look so safe.

**22...O-O 23.cxd5 exd5 24.O-O Bf5 25.Nb3 Ba3 26.Rb7 Qc8 27.Rc7 Qd8**

How infuriating for White! It appears to the naked eye that by the laws of physics, White should extract something from the discovery. Yet, there is nothing there and Black has equalized!

**28.h3 Qh4**

Drawing ideas with ...Bxh3 are in the air.

**29.Kh2 Bb2!?**

Slightly more accurate was 29...Qh6 30.Bc5 Bxc5 31.Nxc5 Qb6 32.Re7 Rfe8 33.Rxe8+ Rxe8 34.Qxd5 Rd8 35.Na4 Rxd5 36.Nxb6 Rd2 37.Nc4 Rxa2 38.Ne3 Be4 39.Rc1 h5 and Black does not stand worse.

**30.Qxb2 Rxb6 31.Qf2!**

White retains an edge in the ending due to his mobile kingside pawn majority.

**31...Qxf2 32.Rxf2 Rb4 33.g4**

33.Ra7 f6! should hold the game.

**33...Bb1?!**

33...Be4! saves a tempo.

**34.Nc5!**

Threatening e6! as well as the a6-pawn.

**34...d4?**

EXERCISE (planning/critical decision): Bitter intensity of effort isn't enough to make up for an inherent defect in our position. After this mistake, White's tiny edge grows into something far more dangerous. We sense opportunity, hidden yet present. Twin dangers lie ahead for Black, as when James Bond engages dual missiles which mysteriously pop out of the headlights of his souped-up Aston-Martin. Black has trouble defending his a-pawn and his king is also a source of worry. Should White play 35 Rd7, following the principle: Place your rooks behind enemy passers? Or should he simply ignore the passed d-pawn and go after Black's king with 35 e6? One line is much stronger than the other. The correct path is hidden somewhere in the depths of the position. What's your take on this?

Correct is 34...Be4 35.Nxa6 Rc4 36.Rxc4 dxc4 37.Nc5 Bc6 38.Rc2 Ra8 39.a4 Bxa4 40.Rxc4 Bc6 41.Rc3 h6 when Black still retains reasonable, drawing chances. This is due to the fact that the remaining pawns are all on the same side of the board.

**35.Rd7?**

This may be a case of that nearly unavoidable complacency which comes along with a winning position. After this move, the black defenders creak beneath their burden yet manage to hold the line. Leko goes for a pawn when he can have so much more. He swaps away something of great value and receives a worthless trinket in return, underestimating the power of his own attack.

ANSWER: With 35.e6! , the conspirators exchange knowing glances as they approach their target: Black's king. After this move, the kingside, like the surface of a dead sun, is a cold, forbidding environment. 35...d3 36.Nd7 Rd8 37.f5 Rd4 38.e7! Re8 39.Rb2 d2 40.Rb8! and what began as a steady accumulation of attackers now assumes the stance of cold fury. Now only slings and arrows of outrageous fortune fly Black's way. 40...f6 41.Rxe8+ Kf7 (the king peeps coyly from his enclosure) 42.Nxf6! Kxf6 43.Rf8+ Kg5 44.e8=Q d1=Q 45.Qe3+ and the love-smitten queen eyes her target with ragged breath and heaving bosom. Black's king, on the other hand, chafes at his assailant's enforced intimacy. 45...Kh4 46.Qe7+ "You will modify your behaviour and conform to Our wishes, or suffer terrible consequences for disobedience," she informs the king, the reluctant object of her love and thus exacts her wrath with 46...g5 47.fxg6# which is a sweet en passant checkmate!

**35...Rb5 36.Nxa6**

When the target lies to the East, why look in a Westerly direction? White won a pawn but distracted himself from what could have been a vicious kingside attack. Now Black's d-pawn generates sufficient play to perhaps hold the game.

**36...d3 37.Rd4 g5!**

A French player should always keep ...g5 in the back of his or her mind. In this case, Nakamura dismantles Leko's once proud centre, after which defensive dreariness soon vanishes.

**38.Nb4 gxf4 39.Nxd3 Bxd3 40.Rxd3 Rxe5**

Attrition of White's fighting units continues without fresh replacements.

**41.Rd4 Ra8 42.a4 Re3 43.Rdxf4 Ra3 44.Rxf7 R3xa4**

The extra pawn is more an ornament than a functional object. One pawn up on the same side in a double rook ending is not enough to win.

**45.Kg3 R4a7**

The draw is even easier if Black manages to swap off a pair of rooks.

**46.R7f5 Ra5 47.Re2 Rxf5!**

The position is drawn, even without Black's h-pawn!

**48.gxf5 Kf7 49.Kf4 Ra6 50.Kg5 h6+ 51.Kh5 Kf6 52.Rf2 Ra4 53.h4**

The suicidal 53.Kxh6?? Rh4# (mate!) would be a delightful way to end a chess game, but such things don't happen to Elo 2700+ rated players.

**53...Rb4 54.Rh2 Kxf5 55.Kxh6 Rb6+ 56.Kg7 Rb7+ 57.Kh6 Rb6+ 58.Kg7 Rb7+ 59.Kh6**

. SUMMARY: Out with the old and in with the new. I believe 12...a6! represents an improvement over the old 12...Bb4, especially with the 15...Qd8 continuation. I comped the coming positions for endless hours and can't find a single path to even a slight edge for White. In comp world, Black always equalizes and holds the draw!<skip start="15...Qd8"/>

### (35)Topalov, V.   --   Nakamura, H. 18: Amber (rapid), Monaco  2011   1-0   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qb6 9.Qd2 Qxb2 10.Rb1 Qa3 11.Bb5 Nxd4 12.Bxd4 a6 13.Rb3!?**

QUESTION: Won't this simply transpose to the position we reached in the previous game? --- ANSWER: No. This line is radically different. Just watch!

**13...Qe7 14.Ba4!?**

A new move then and a risky attempt to refute the Poisoned Pawn Line. White dares Black to win a piece with ...b5 next. GM Mikhail Golubev gave this move an exclamation mark. --- QUESTION: Since you downgraded the exclam to an "interesting" mark, I take it that you don't believe this is a refutation, correct? --- ANSWER: Correct. According to the comps, Black remains fine in this line as well.

With regards to your earlier question about transposition, if White attempts to transpose to the previous game with 14.Bxd7+?! , Black responds with 14...Qxd7! when White can no longer pick up the b7-pawn. Black already stands better here.

**14...b5!?**

Nakamura refuses to allow the provocation to go unchallenged.

Golubev suggests the untested 14...g6 without analysis. Let's take a look. After 15.O-O Bg7 , Black's idea is to induce Bxd7+ since ...b5 is a very real threat, with Black about to castle. 16.Bxd7+ Qxd7 17.Bc5! (this annoying move offers White full compensation) 17...Bf8 18.Bxf8 Kxf8 19.Qd4 b5 20.a4 Qa7 21.Qxa7 Rxa7 22.axb5 axb5 23.Nxb5 Ra2 24.Nd6 Ke7 25.Rb8 Rxc2 26.Ra1 Rd8 27.Raa8 Kd7 28.Ra7+ Rc7 29.Raa8 Rc2 and I don't think either side can make headway.

In the next game, we will discuss 14...Qd8 , declining White's offer.

**15.Bxb5 axb5 16.Nxb5 Qd8 17.Qc3!**

White's point. He threatens a monster check on c7.

**17...Qa5**

The only move.

**18.Nc7+ Kd8 19.Nxa8 Qxa8 20.O-O**

This is our tabiya position in the Topalov line. --- QUESTION: Who stands better? --- ANSWER: That's not an easy question! Golubev feels White stands better, while I interpret the position as dynamically balanced. The unbiased Houdini rates it at 0.00. Two critical points to consider: 1. White picked up a rook and one pawn for two minor pieces - generally not quite enough in the middlegame, so Black is ahead materially. --- 2. It all boils down to the question: Is Black's king safe? If so, he stands better. If not, he stands worse.

**20...Qa4 21.Kh1**

Not 21.Rb8? because of 21...Qxd4+! ( 21...Nxb8?? 22.Bb6+ mates ) 22.Qxd4 Bc5 and Black stands better in the ending.

**21...Be7!**

An improvement over 21...Qc4 22.Qa5+ Ke8 ( Topalov gave the line 22...Qc7?! 23.Qxc7+ Kxc7 24.Rc3+ Kd8 25.Rb1 intending a4, a5, Rc6 and a6 ) 23.Rd1 Qa6 24.Qc7 Qc4 25.Rc3 Qxc7 26.Rxc7 Kd8 27.Ra7 as played in W.Spiegel-G.Kirsch, correspondence 2011. White has the advantage after 27...f6 28.c4 fxe5 29.fxe5 dxc4 30.Bb6+ Ke7 31.Rc1 g5 32.Rxc4 Bg7 33.Bc7 when Black is tied up and must worry about the passed a-pawn's advance.

**22.Rfb1 f6!**

Golubev called this "insufficient" but I don't agree, and feel it is Black's logical plan to challenge the centre to unravel.

I don't blame Nakamura for avoiding the passive 22...Qa6 and simply asking White how he plans to proceed. I have a feeling Black must do something or else White's passed a-pawn will slowly march forward.

**23.exf6 gxf6?**

EXERCISE (combination alert): After Black's last move, the defence's nervous system is rendered out of sync with the position's requirements and this handicaps him in his efforts to quash White's uprising. His position contains a hidden, underlying fatal flaw, like a person who appears externally healthy, while inside the body, the undetected cancer reaches Stage II. How did Topalov gain a decisive advantage?

Black should clear the e7-square and challenge the d4-bishop with 23...Bxf6! 24.Bxf6+ gxf6 . Massively fortified sheer walls rise up to frustrate White's attackers, who are unable to find a weak point in Black's position. Houdini rates this position at dead even.

**24.Rb6!**

ANSWER: Invade b6, since the rook is immune. I'm afraid this rook is the ogre in Black's fairy tale.

**24...Qxa2!**

Perhaps Black's best move.

Other choices are unpalatable: 24...Nxb6?? 25.Bxb6+ Kd7 26.Qc7+ ends the game.

24...Nf8?? 25.Rc6 Qa8 26.Bb6+ Kd7 27.Rc7+ and White wins.

24...Qc4 25.Rc6 Qxc3 26.Bxc3 Ba3 27.Rxe6 Ne5 28.Rxf6 Nc4 29.Rb5 and I don't think Black can save himself, since he is down in material and more pawns fall.

**25.Re1?!**

Inaccurate.

White should play 25.R1b3 Qa4 26.Rc6 Qa8 27.Rxe6 with a winning position.

**25...Qc4 26.Rbxe6**

White's rooks snap and peck at the e6-pawn, like seagulls swooping down for the flesh of a dead fish washed ashore.

**26...Bb4?**

Black should jump at the chance to remove queens off the board with 26...Qxc3 27.Bxc3 Ne5 28.fxe5 Bxe6 29.exf6 Kd7 30.fxe7 Rc8 31.Bb4 Bf7 32.c3 . I don't think the opposite-coloured bishops are enough to save Black here but this is still his path of greatest resistance.

**27.Bxf6+ Nxf6 28.Qxf6+ Kc7**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Opportunity and wealth spread out before White, like new toys on the carpet on Christmas day to a six-year-old. Houdini assesses this position at +18.05, where White is nearly the equivalent of two queens up! But this is contingent upon White finding the winning combination. Do you see what Topalov missed?

**29.Re7+?**

Topalov isn't exactly concluding the game with polished ease of motion. The rook nursed a sullen resentment against White's king for quite a while, which now boils over to open hostility. The decisions we make when our clocks begin to run low resemble early stages of intoxication: We are vaguely aware that we engage in questionable, self-destructive actions, but just can't help ourselves! The Houdini assessment plummeted to +0.66, about half a pawn's worth only!

ANSWER: White had too many attractive options and Topalov missed 29.Qe5+! Kb7 30.Qg7+! as the queen, unable to make up her mind about Black's king, begins to tap her teeth with a pen, pondering: "Hanging? Beheading? Burning at the stake? Or perhaps the rack? Which would be best?" With 30...Kb8 ( 30...Qc7 31.Re7 ends the contest ) 31.Qxh8 Bxe1 32.Qe5+ Ka7 33.Qa1+ Ba6 34.Rxe1 , White is easily winning.

**29...Bd7!**

A player of Nakamura's calibre doesn't allow himself to get rattled by an unexpected downturn of events. Suddenly, Black begins to see a shimmer of hope. He is right back in the game and motion slowly returns to his once-palsied position.

**30.Qe5+ Kc6! 31.Qxh8 Bxe7**

The trouble is White can't recapture on e7 since he must cover his back rank on f1.

**32.Qa8+ Kc7 33.Qa7+ Kd8!**

Nakamura defends like a comp and the rocky course of events has most certainly not matured along the path which Topalov originally envisioned.

The terrible 33...Kd6?? 34.Qb6+ Bc6 35.Qb8+ Kd7 36.Qa7+ wins for White.

**34.Qb8+**

Topalov said he calculated to this point and intended 34.Qb6+ Ke8! ( 34...Kc8?? and now White can play 35.Rxe7 since White's back rank isn't hanging anymore, thus 35...Qf1+ 36.Qg1 wins ) 35.Qd6? . Here, he realized Black had a combination. In fact, let's make an exercise of it: EXERCISE (combination alert): Black to play and save himself. --- ANSWER: Deflection. Black's queen, a woman of volcanic passions, obviously doesn't take kindly to rejection and reacts with 35...Qf1+! 36.Rxf1 Bxd6 when Black saves the game.

**34...Bc8 35.Qe5**

At this stage, the pressure of long, continuous defence gets to Nakamura, as he begins to fumble.

**35...Bc5?!**

After this inaccuracy Black's position becomes irreparable.

Correct was 35...Bb4! 36.Rd1 Kd7! 37.Qxd5+ Qxd5 38.Rxd5+ Bd6 39.Rd4 Kc6 and a rook and three pawns are a lot for two bishops. Houdini assesses this at only +0.49, about half a pawn up for White. However, I think this is a misassesment. I played out the position against the comps and as I suspected, White won, but only with great difficulty.

**36.f5!**

Topalov sacs the c2-pawn to transform his f-pawn into a serious weapon.

**36...Qxc2 37.f6 Qf5 38.Qe8+ Kc7 39.Rc1! Kb6 40.f7 d4 41.Qd8+ Kb5**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Black's king finds it quite disconcerting that White's queen continues to refer to him in the past tense. How did White convert his advantage to the full point? --- ANSWER: Double attack/removal of a key defender/deflection.

**42.Qc7!**

The queen's now non-existent conscience is shrivelled and atrophied from a lifetime of disuse. She wipes away tears of joy at seeing the suffering and woe she causes in Black's camp.

After 42.Qc7 Be6 , the flustered bishops clearly do not love their fellow man or woman (especially White's queen!), a clear violation of their job guidelines, which state that they should love everyone. Now simplest is 43.Qxc5+ and in one swoop, White removes both defenders of the f8-square and wraps up the game with 43...Qxc5 44.Rxc5+ Kxc5 45.f8=Q+ . --- SUMMARY: Topalov's 13 Rb3 and 14 Ba4 idea is at the time of this writing, our greatest theoretical challenge of the chapter. According to the comps, Black is still okay, but we must play exceedingly accurately. Also, we don't have to accept the piece. We have options to decline like Golubev's 14...g6. In fact, let's move on to our next game, where we take a look at 14...Qd8, which also declines the dangerous Topalov piece sac.

1-0

### (36)Popilsky, G.   --   Ikonnikov, V. 19: Dieren  2012   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qb6 9.Qd2 Qxb2**

"I don't steal," philosophizes the queen, adding, "I appropriate."

**10.Rb1 Qa3 11.Bb5 Nxd4 12.Bxd4 a6 13.Rb3 Qe7 14.Ba4 Qd8**

Thanks but no thanks! Black refuses to enter the Topalov jungle with Nakamura's daredevil 14...b5!? lash-out and instead, politely declines. --- QUESTION: If Topalov's sac is so dangerous for Black, then why doesn't everyone play 14...Qd8? --- ANSWER: One issue is that White can force a draw by going back and forth with Bb6 and Bf2. --- QUESTION: So what? A draw with Black is a good result, isn't it? --- ANSWER: A draw is fine if you assume the players are evenly rated or that Black doesn't desperately need to win, due to the tournament standings. But what if Black is rated 2100 and White 1750? Or if White only needs a draw to secure first place in the tournament while Black needs to win? Then the draw may not be so tempting. So basically, only use 14...Qd8 when a draw is okay for you.

**15.Bb6**

This move essentially forces a draw.

**15...Qh4+**

QUESTION: Can Black play for the win with 15...Qe7 ? --- ANSWER: Not a good idea, since Black just gave White the very desirable Bb6 for free. This is not a position conducive for giving away a tempo! Play may continue 16.O-O g6 17.Qe3! and the problem now is the intended 17...Bg7? is met with the crushing 18.Nxd5! exd5 19.Bc5 Qe6 ( 19...Qd8?? 20.e6 is devastating as well ) 20.Rb6 Qf5 21.e6 fxe6 22.Rxe6+ Kf7 ( 22...Kd8?? 23.Bb6+ Nxb6 24.Qxb6# mate! ) 23.Re7+ Kg8 24.Rxg7+! Kxg7 25.Bd4+ Kf7 26.Re1 Qe4 27.Qc3 Re8 28.Rxe4 Rxe4 29.Bb3 when Black's undeveloped forces have no hope of keeping their king safe.

**16.Kd1?**

A new move and not such a good one. This looks like a misguided winning attempt. White no longer has any compensation for the pawn if we add the fact that his own king is insecure.

White has better choices in: 16.Bf2 Qd8 17.Bb6 Qh4+ and we get a draw by repetition of moves, which is an awfully short game!

QUESTION: Can White change his mind and play 16.g3 instead? --- ANSWER: Yes, White can take this route. Houdini slightly favours Black after 16...Qh3 : ( 17.Rf1 with the idea of f5 next was seen in A.Brkic-F.Poetz, Bad Gleichenberg 2013. Black should prevent f5 withBlack should prevent f5 with 17...Qf5! 18.g4!? Qxg4 19.f5 Be7 20.Rf4 Bh4+! ( 20...Qh5?! 21.Nxd5 exd5 22.e6 O-O 23.exd7 Bh4+ 24.Kf1 Bg5 25.f6 g6 26.Kg2 and White looks better in this chaotic position ) 21.Kf1 Bg5! 22.Rxg4 Bxd2 23.Rxg7 Kf8 24.fxe6 fxe6! 25.Rxd7 Bxd7 26.Bxd7 Ke7 27.Ba4 Rac8 and Black takes over the initiative, thus stands better. ) ( 17.Ne4!? dxe4?? ( better is 17...Be7! to initiate castling as soon as possible ) 18.Rc3! (intending Rxc8+!) 18...Bb4 19.Rxc8+ Rxc8 20.Bxd7+ Ke7 21.Qxb4+ Kxd7 22.Ba5 Rxc2 23.Qxb7+ Ke8 24.Bb4 leaves Black busted. )

**16...Be7 17.h3 Bd8!?**

This move and the ones to follow effectively blot out the sun of Black's initiative. I'm not sure that 17...Bd8 is necessary.

Very favourable for Black is the line 17...Qh6! 18.Kc1 O-O 19.Bxd7 Bxd7 20.Rf1 Rac8 21.Be3 Rc4 22.f5 Qh4 23.f6 gxf6 24.exf6 Bd6 25.Rxb7 Bc6 26.Rb3 Rc8 27.Kb1 Be5 and White is busted.

**18.Bxd7+ Bxd7 19.Bf2**

White hopes to regain his pawn on b7.

**19...Qh5+ 20.g4 Qg6 21.Bc5!?**

...and then he changes his mind! --- QUESTION: Why not take b7?

ANSWER: He probably should have but his position doesn't inspire confidence after 21.Rxb7 Bc6 22.Ra7 Rxa7 23.Bxa7 h5 24.Rg1 hxg4 25.hxg4 Qh6 26.Be3 Qh3 with advantage to Black as his king looks safer. Also White's structure looks slightly overextended though this still looks better than the way White played in the game.

**21...Bc6?!**

Passive defence wasn't necessary.

Black has 21...Rc8! 22.Qe3 h5 23.g5 b5 with a strategically won game.

**22.Rg1**

Hoping to sneak in f5 at some point, when Black isn't looking.

**22...Ba5**

I prefer 22...Rc8 .

**23.Qd4 h5?**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Black's last move was a blunder and hands White a golden but deeply hidden tactical opportunity. Find White's shot, and his position goes from inferior to winning. What did both sides miss?

Once again, 23...Rc8! was necessary to prevent White's combination.

**24.Kc1?**

ANSWER: Both sides missed the crushing 24.Rxb7!! . --- Cruel forces at play begin to shape the black king's destiny. The perfect moment for a trap or combination is when your opponent is certain there is nothing amiss in his or her defences. --- Now if 24...Bxb7?? 25.Qa4+ Kd8 26.Qxa5+ Kd7 , Black's king, a mouse after a thunderstorm, emerges tentatively from his hole. With 27.Na4 Rhc8 ( 27...Qe4 28.Nb6+ Ke8 29.Nxa8 wins ) 28.Qb4 Bc6 29.Bf8!! , White executes a brilliant shot, intending to enter e7 or d6 with the queen. Black's king deals with the acute sense of injury of the bar drunk who is dying to tell his unfortunate life's story but can't find anyone willing to listen - including the bartender. Following 29...Kc7 ( 29...Rxf8 30.Qd6+ Ke8 31.Qxc6+ Ke7 32.Qb7+ Ke8 33.Qxa8+ mates in a few moves ) 30.Qc5 (White threatens the calm Rg3 and Rc3) 30...Qe4 31.Qb6+ Kd7 32.Nc5+ , White picks off the queen, whose words trail off in midsentence, with a suppressed scream.

**24...O-O-O!?**

Castling into it. The king books what he hopes to be a restful cruise on the Lusitania.

My feeling is Black's king may actually be safer in the middle with 24...Rc8 .

**25.Bb6**

White attempts to enter via the dark squares.

**25...Bxb6 26.Rxb6 Rd7**

EXERCISE (planning): White can consider an exchange sac on c6 to activate his knight and take over the dark squares. Opportunity wars with caution. Is the sac a viable reality or a mirage? --- ANSWER: The exchange sac is White's best attacking plan, whereby he eliminates Black's best defender. Yes, once again, the much maligned bad bishop was actually Black's most efficient defensive piece.

**27.Rxc6+!**

The rook gives the bishop no chance to intervene on behalf of his king.

**27...bxc6 28.Na4 Qe4!**

Wisely played with a tone of compromise.

Less accurate is 28...Rc7?! 29.Nc5 hxg4 30.Nxa6 Qe4 31.Qxe4 dxe4 32.Nxc7 Kxc7 33.hxg4 and this is almost similar to what happened in the game, except that in this line, Black drops the a6-pawn.

**29.Nb6+ Kc7 30.Qxe4 dxe4 31.Nxd7 Kxd7 32.g5**

Played in order to keep Black's rook out.

**32...Rd8**

EXERCISE (critical decision): Should White force a king and pawn ending with 33 Rd1+ or not? Work out the variations.

After 32...Rb8 33.c3! Ke7 34.Re1 Rd8 35.Re3! f5 36.gxf6+ gxf6 37.Rxe4 Rd3 38.Rc4 fxe5 39.fxe5 Kd7 40.Rh4 Rxc3+ 41.Kb2 Re3 42.Rxh5 c5 , Black stands slightly better since he can play ...Kc6 and ...Kd5, although I suspect White should still draw due to the reduced number of pawns.

**33.Re1?!**

White suffers a bit in a rook and pawn ending.

ANSWER: The king and pawn ending is drawn after 33.Rd1+! Kc7 34.Rxd8 Kxd8 35.a4! and we examine the alternatives: 35...Ke7 ( 35...Kc7 36.a5 c5 37.c4 cuts off the black king's queenside entry points ) 36.Kd2 f6 37.exf6+ gxf6 38.h4 a5 39.Ke3 f5 40.Kd4 Kd6 41.c4 Ke7 42.c5 Kf7 43.Ke3 and neither side can make progress. For example, after 43...e5 44.fxe5 , Black cannot overpress and play 44...Ke6?? 45.g6 Ke7 46.Kf4 Ke6 47.Kg5! e3 48.Kh6 e2 49.g7 e1=Q 50.g8=Q+ Ke7 when the e-pawn cannot be captured since White's queen will get skewered after a queen check on the e-file. Following 51.Qg7+ Ke6 52.Qg6+ Kd5 53.Qf7+ Kxc5 54.e6 , the e-pawn is too fast for Black.

**33...c5?**

This once again allows the drawn king and pawn ending.

Black has an edge after 33...Kc7 34.Rxe4 a5 .

**34.Rxe4?**

The rook refuses to broker the correct transaction.

34.Rd1+! forces the drawn king and pawn ending. If at first you don't succeed... then...well, White hopes to make a good second impression.

**34...Kc6 35.h4?**

White's best chance to draw lay in 35.Re3 Rd4 36.Ra3 Rxf4 37.Rxa6+ Kb7 38.Rd6 g6 . Even here, Black has winning chances due to White's loose pawns.

**35...Rd4**

Back to the king and pawn ending, this time with Black gaining the opposition.

**36.Rxd4 cxd4 37.Kd2 Kd5 38.Kd3 a5 39.a3 a4 40.c3 dxc3 41.Kxc3**

EXERCISE (critical decision/calculation): Should Black play 41...Ke4? Calculate the race and the end result. --- ANSWER: Black is faster in the race.

**41...Ke4! 42.Kb4**

White's king, much like Cinderella early in her career, gets left behind in the race.

**42...Kxf4 43.Kxa4 Kxe5 44.Kb5 Kd6!**

An overwhelming sense of futility pervades White's position, which sickens further with each passing move. This is the key move in Black's calculation, which either costs White a tempo or allows Black's king to halt the a-pawn.

**45.a4**

Also ultimately futile is 45.Kb6 e5 46.a4 e4 47.a5 e3 48.a6 e2 49.a7 e1=Q 50.a8=Q when the a-pawn, a spent marathoner crossing the finish line, arrives at the end of its journey, exhausted yet euphoric. Following 50...Qb4+ 51.Ka6 Qa4+ , the queen believes the world revolves around her whims. As it turns out, she is correct in her assumption. After 52.Kb7 and even stronger than entering the easily won king and pawn ending, Black can play for mate with 52...Qb5+! 53.Ka7 and the king, after his harrowing experience, finally relaxes and indulges in the luxury of a restful sigh - which unfortunately turns out to be premature due to 53...Kc7! . White's unfortunate king is cornered, with his useless queen only there for moral support. There are some diagrams which don't require words. There is no practical joke worse than one which ends in your assuming the role of the butt of the joke. "A few years from today, the four of us will roar with uncontrolled laughter at this misunderstanding," White's nervous king tells Black's king and queen, who don't see the humour in it, now or in the future.

**45...Kc7 46.Kc5 f5**

. SUMMARY: Play 14...Qd8 only if you are okay with a quick draw.

0-1

### (37)Kamsky, G.   --   So, W. 20: FIDE World Cup, Khanty-Mansiysk  2009   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3 Qb6**

QUESTION: What's going on here? This is a completely different line! --- ANSWER: Please try to remain calm. I believe we spoke earlier in the chapter about the necessity of cutting back on caffeine intake and also adding a daily meditation practice (chamomile tea is also excellent) to heal your frayed nerves.

We will soon transpose back to the Poisoned Pawn Line which occurs after the usual 7...cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qb6 (and 9.a3 which we soon discuss) move order.

**8.a3 cxd4 9.Nxd4**

There we go. Now we have transposed. --- QUESTION: What are the plusses and minuses of the a3 Gambit Declined line? --- ANSWER: 1. Black is unable to take the b2-pawn, since Na4 traps the queen. --- 2. With the pawn on a3, annoying ...Bb4 ideas are prevented. --- 3. White's pawn move is a non-developing one in a position which desperately requires rapid mobilization.

**9...Bc5**

As in the first chapter of the book, we focus on control over the d4-square.

A nasty point of the a3 line is that the b2-pawn is taboo as previously mentioned, due to 9...Qxb2?? 10.Na4 trapping the wayward queen.

Also, it can help White make queenside inroads after 9...Nxd4 10.Bxd4 Bc5 11.Nb5 O-O 12.b4 Bxd4 13.Qxd4 Qxd4 14.Nxd4 as seen in T.Wedberg-F.Vallejo Pons, Leon 2001. White holds a slight edge due to the extra space and superior bishop. However, Black's position is solid and he may generate some play along the c-file. This line is for French Defence players who favour endings and don't mind defending a slightly inferior position in the hopes of drawing.

**10.Na4**

This is White's main move.

10.Ncb5 a6!? isn't so bad for Black ( 10...Nxd4 11.Bxd4 O-O 12.b4 transposes into Wedberg-Vallejo Pons (in notes to 9...Bc5) ) 11.Nxc6 , and after 11...axb5 12.Bxc5 Nxc5 13.Nd4 Bd7 14.c3 O-O 15.Be2 f6 16.Nf3?! ( correct was 16.exf6 gxf6!? 17.Qd2 Rae8 and I prefer Black, who is about to roll his centre forward ) 16...fxe5 17.fxe5 Ra4! , Black already stands better, with the rook about to enter e4, L.Kritz-R.Wehner, Germany 2003. In this game, the GM handling White was held to a draw by the untitled Black player who had the initiative throughout the whole game.

**10...Qa5+ 11.c3**

11.Nc3 Qb6 repeats the position. --- QUESTION: What if Black wants to play for a win here? --- ANSWER: This is a bit of a problem for Black since dodging the draw may hand White an edge. Black's options: ( 11...Qd8?! 12.Qd2 transposes to Chapter One, but with White having the possibly useful extra a3-move. ) ( 11...Nxd4 12.Bxd4 Bxd4 ( 12...Qb6 transposes to note (b) from above once again, but if White is intent on a draw he or she can repeat with 13.Na4 ) 13.Qxd4 a6 14.Bd3 was L.Kambrath-E.Bellaiche, Nimes 2012. Now Black can play 14...Qc5 15.Ne2 Qxd4 16.Nxd4 Nc5 with an even ending. Black will play ...Ke7, ...Bd7 and can play for queenside expansion, with a well-timed ...f6 break in hand. )

11.b4 Qxa4 12.bxc5 Nxd4 ( 12...Nxc5!? 13.Nb5 Ne4 14.Nc7+ Kd8 15.Nxa8 Qa5+ 16.Bd2 Qc5 offers Black full compensation, since the a8-knight will later be trapped. Following 17.Qc1 Nd4 18.Ra2 Nf3+ 19.gxf3 Qf2+ 20.Kd1 Qxf3+ 21.Ke1 , the game will end in perpetual check after 21...Qf2+ 22.Kd1 Qf3+ ) 13.Bxd4 b6 and Black frees his game. After 14.cxb6 axb6 15.Be2 Ba6 , Black stands better since he managed to eliminate his bad bishop and remains with the superior structure, "hawler"-C.Lakdawala, Internet (blitz) 2013.

**11...Bxd4! 12.Bxd4 Nxd4 13.Qxd4 b6!**

The starting position of our line. --- QUESTION: Isn't Black just clearly worse here due to the bad bishop? --- ANSWER: Black does indeed have a bad bishop, but let's not forget that White's horribly offside a4-knight represents a serious problem for his side. This easily offsets our bad bishop issues. With our last move, we introduce the strategic threats ...Nc5 and also ...Ba6.

**14.Be2!?**

This move is a little-played offshoot.

White normally goes for 14.Qb4 instead. After 14...Qxb4 15.axb4 Ke7 16.Bb5 Bb7 17.O-O Rhd8 18.Kf2 f6 19.Bxd7 Rxd7 20.Ke3 , believe it or not, I actually prefer Black's chances in this ending, bad bishop and all, since White's knight is imprisoned on a4. The only way to bring the knight back into play is via the b2-square, and pushing the b-pawn to free up the square will weaken the c3-pawn. With 20...Rf8 ( also possible is 20...Rc8 21.b3 Bc6 22.Kd4 Rdc7 23.Nb2 Bb5 24.Rfc1 Rf8 25.exf6+ gxf6 26.c4 Rfc8 when chances look balanced ) 21.b3 Bc6 22.Nb2 Bb5 23.Rf3 Kd8 24.Rd1 Ke7 25.Ra1 Rc7 26.Kd4 Be8 , the g6-square represents a Valhalla for the bad bishop. Once it reaches that square, few dare to call him "bad". After 27.Re1 Bg6 28.Nd3 Be4 , Black stands at least equal, J.Nunn-J.Ehlvest, Reykjavik 1988.

**14...Ba6**

14...Nc5 15.Qb4 Nxa4 16.Bb5+ Bd7 17.Bxd7+ Kxd7 18.Qd6+ Kc8 19.Qc6+ Kb8 20.b4 Qa6 21.Qd6+ ends in perpetual check.

**15.Bd1 Qb5 16.b4**

Black's knight is brusquely denied access to the c5-square, at the cost of weakening the c4-square and the c3-pawn.

**16...Rc8 17.Nb2 Qc6 18.Rc1 O-O**

A new move.

Black also looks better after 18...f6 19.exf6 Nxf6 , E.Gueroff-T.Jackelen, Germany 1988.

**19.a4**

Gaining queenside space and threatening a cheapo on b5.

**19...Bc4**

The former bad bishop, having won recognition and his freedom, understandably refuses to go back to his old lifestyle. He hurries to c4 before White can shut him out with b5.

**20.Bg4!?**

I have doubts about the effectiveness of this expedition. Kamsky may be overestimating his position.

Perhaps he should enter emergency mode with 20.Nxc4 Qxc4 21.Qxc4 Rxc4 22.Rf1 d4! 23.Bb3 Rxc3 24.Rxc3 dxc3 25.Rf3 Rc8 26.Rd3 Nb8 27.Kd1 Nc6 28.Rxc3 Rd8+ 29.Ke2 Nxb4 30.f5! exf5 31.Rc7 Rf8 32.e6 fxe6 33.Bxe6+ Kh8 34.Bxf5 a5 35.Rb7 g6 36.Be4 Rf6 when White's superior activity should save the game, despite Black's extra pawn.

**20...Bb3!?**

Black stands clearly better after 20...a5! 21.Kf2 b5! 22.Nxc4 bxc4 23.b5 Qc7 24.Rc2 Nc5 25.Ra2 f6 when White's king is in serious trouble.

**21.O-O!**

Kamsky finds the best move.

21.Bd1? saves the a-pawn at too high a cost after 21...Bxd1 22.Kxd1 a5 23.Ke2 f6 when White's king is living dangerously while bouncing around the middle.

21.b5?! hands over the critical b5-square. Black stands clearly better after 21...Qc5 22.O-O Qa3! 23.c4 dxc4 .

**21...Bxa4 22.f5!?**

An external solution is unlikely to fix an internal problem, which in this case is potential overextension. White's play is infused with unwarranted optimism. I doubt he gets full compensation for the pawn here. It feels to me like Kamsky places undue emphasis on what should be a secondary concern. Sometimes possession of too much natural ability can have the effect of reinforcing faults. For example, the young Tal, knowing he trumps everyone else in irrational positions, would often sac unsoundly. These sacs worked most of the time - but not always! In this case, Kamsky's astonishing defensive abilities induce him to risk overpressing, since in the back of his mind, he may believe he can save himself in any inferior position should matters go awry.

Perhaps best is to agree to grovel mode with 22.Nxa4! Qxa4 23.Ra1 Qc2 24.Rxa7 Rfd8 25.f5 Qxc3 26.Qxc3 Rxc3 27.fxe6 Nxe5 28.Bh3 g6 and if 29.exf7+ Kf8 30.Rb7 d4 31.Rxb6 d3 32.Re6 Nc4 33.Re4 (threat: Bd7!) 33...Nd2 34.Re8+ Rxe8 35.fxe8=R+ Kxe8 36.Re1+ Kf8 37.Be6! ( 37.b5?? Nf3+! 38.gxf3 d2 39.Rd1 Rc1 is curtains for White ) 37...Rc2 38.b5 Rb2 39.Re3 Rxb5 and 40.Rxd3 leads to a draw.

**22...Bb5 23.Rfe1 Rfe8 24.Re3?**

This mission of war is ill-advised. In this game, Kamsky is in possession of every virtuous trait but one: Patience. White's last move envisions an attack, possibly based on a rook-lift later on to g3 or h3. However, White's centre is far too unstable for such a leisurely build-up.

Instead, White had to try 24.Bf3 .

**24...f6 !**

So Black finds a clever method of breaking White's kingside/central bind and now White's central structure curls like dry leaves tossed in a bonfire.

**25.fxe6 Nxe5 26.Bf5 g6 27.Bh3 Qd6**

Black can also think about activating the passed a-pawn with 27...a5 .

**28.Rd1 Rcd8 29.Rd2**

EXERCISE (planning): My father was an attorney and all my childhood arguments, cajoling and tantrums were casually dismantled with Botvinnikian logic: 1. "You are eight years old and the law says you are too young to legally own a motorcycle." --- 2. "You are currently jobless and accumulated only $12.42 in your savings account - not nearly enough to buy a motorcycle." --- 3. "Don't look to me for a loan. I'm not Santa Claus." --- The Filipino grandmaster So, with the same powerful sense of logic, composed an effective plan to systematically strengthen his game and display the unsoundness of Kamsky's previous intent. What would you play here as Black? --- ANSWER: Principle: Counter in the centre when attacked on the wing.

**29...Qe7!**

Intending ...Nc6, followed by ...d4, after which Black takes over the initiative.

**30.Rf2 Nc6**

"Be very aware that I call the shots!" the knight reminds those around him.

**31.Qd2 d4**

Now Black's idea reverberates with power, akin to a pipe organ's sound overwhelming the cathedral.

**32.Re4 dxc3 33.Qxc3 Rf8 34.g4!?**

The g-pawn ceases to be amenable to reason and pushes forward with a risky scheme. White is busted so he tries desperately to fix the f6-pawn as a stationary target and have his bishop re-enter the game, at a cost to his own king's safety.

**34...Rd6 35.Bg2 Ne5 36.g5**

This undermining attempt doesn't bother Black.

**36...Rxe6**

Ah, the relief. So exorcises a great evil from his position.

**37.gxf6 Rfxf6 38.Rxf6 Qxf6**

Black is up two pawns without a trace of compensation for White.

**39.Re3 Bc6**

Systematically eliminating White's best defender.

**40.Nd1 Qg5 41.Rg3 Qf4 42.Nf2 Bxg2 43.Kxg2 Nc4!**

We sense premonitory flutterings here and there, around White's now seriously exposed king. When Black's knight lands on e3, it disconnects White's defenders. Kamsky's normally brilliant defensive skills are ill-fitted and too overburdened to deal with such an endless series of calamities.

**44.Qd3 Ne3+ 45.Kg1 Nf5 46.Qd5 Qc1+ 47.Nd1**

Diagram

After 47.Kg2?? Ne3+ , the knight grabs White's king and queen by the scruff of their necks, akin to my terrier Kahless discovering a pair of unlucky rodents in the backyard. Following 48.Rxe3 Qxe3 , Black wins more material.

**47...Kf7 48.Rc3 Qg5+ 49.Kf2 Qf4+**

White's king is denied respite at every turn. Black's queen gives him a look normally reserved for a judge who about to pronounce sentence on a particularly vile mass murderer in the dock.

**50.Kg2 Qg4+ 51.Kf2 Qe2+**

One must reassess the purity of the queen's motives as she lurks about, near White's king.

**52.Kg1 Qe1+ 53.Kg2**

EXERCISE (planning): White is obviously busted. Find Black's most efficient method of finishing the game. --- ANSWER: Unpinning. Now Black's rook is free to threaten ...Re2+.

**53...Kg7!**

There is no defence to the rook invasion: 53...Kg7! 54.Rc2 ( 54.Nf2 Re2 55.Qd7+ Re7 56.Qd3 Nh4+ 57.Kg3 Re5! 58.Qd7+ Kh6 59.Qd1 Rg5+ 60.Kh3 Qxf2 forces mate. "So you judge me a monster?" Black's queen asks the king, adding "Keep in mind, it is your past actions which made me this way." ) 54...Rd6 and the white queen's hand trembles as she writes out her confession. After 55.Rc7+ Kh6 , not only does White's knight fall, but his king also gets fried in the process. --- SUMMARY: The a3 line, like all the declined lines of this chapter, allows Black equality.

0-1

### (38)Mitkov, N.   --   Alvarez Ibarra, R. 21: Capablanca Memorial, Matanzas  1995   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qb6 9.Be2**

QUESTION: Why is this game in the section of declined lines? Can't Black simply grab b2 next move?

**9...Bc5!**

Declining is best.

ANSWER: This one is tricky, because taking the b2-pawn here is against our best interests. For example, if you adopt the philosophy "Never turn down a free meal" and play 9...Qxb2?! , you may run into the following: ( 10.Ndb5! and believe it or not, this move (White's best) is actually unplayed in the position. This double attack threatens Nc7 and also prepares to trap our queen with Rb1. The only move for Black is 10...Qb4 and after 11.Bd2 Kd8 12.Nxd5 Qe4 13.Ndc3 Qxg2 14.Bf3 Qh3 15.Ne4 , White's attacking chances are worth more than Black's extra pawn. ) ( 10.Ncb5 instead was played in D.Stets-R.Gasik, Hlohovec 1998. Black can counter with 10...Bc5! 11.Rb1 Qxa2 12.Nc7+ Kd8 13.Ncxe6+! ( not 13.Nxa8?? as Black is close to winning after 13...Nxd4 ) 13...fxe6 14.Nxe6+ Ke8 15.Bxc5 Nxc5 16.Nc7+ Kd8 17.Nxa8 Qa5+ 18.Qd2 Qxd2+ 19.Kxd2 and Black looks okay in the ending since the a8-knight is trapped. )

**10.Na4**

The same steps to a slightly altered dance.

**10...Qa5+ 11.c3 Bxd4 12.Bxd4 Nxd4 13.Qxd4 b6**

QUESTION: Isn't this a slightly superior version for White as compared to the previous game? --- ANSWER: Maybe a shade better, since Be2 is clearly more useful than a3, which only serves to weaken White's light squares. Still, I don't believe White extracts even an iota of advantage from this position and Black stands fully equal, even with the favourable tweak on White's side.

**14.Bd1**

In an earlier game, White concentrated with swift development via 14.O-O Ba6 15.Bxa6 Qxa6 16.f5 O-O 17.b3 b5 . However 18.Nc5 proves to be a waste of time, ( 18.Nb2 Rac8 19.Nd3 Qb6 looks at least equal for Black, if not slightly better ) 18...Nxc5 19.Qxc5 Rfc8 20.Qb4 Qb6+ 21.Kh1 a5 22.Qg4 which occurred in A.Sherzer-I.Almasi,I Hungary 1995. ( White is the one fighting for the draw after 22.Qd4 Qxd4 23.cxd4 Rc2 ) 22...Rxc3 . At this point, Black can safely take the c3-pawn without getting mated after 23.f6 g6 24.Rf3 ( 24.Qg5 is met with 24...Qe3 ) 24...Qc5 and White's f6 pawn wedge doesn't compensate him for being a pawn down.

**14...Qb5**

Inviting a draw by repetition. --- QUESTION: Well, then I repeat my question from last game. What if Black wants to play for a win?

ANSWER: Black's options: 14...O-O 15.O-O Bb7 and Black intends to play Bc6, ( also playable is 15...Ba6 , J.Polasek-B.Zueger, Prague 1989, but I don't want to encourage White to play 16.Rf3 ) 16.b4 Qa6 . White can follow up with 17.a3 Qc4 18.Qxc4 dxc4 19.Nb2 b5 20.a4 a6 with an equal position.

Black can also try the untried, Steinitzian 14...Nb8!? 15.O-O Nc6 16.Qd2 O-O 17.b4 Qa6 18.a3 Bd7 (threat: ...Nxe5) 19.Nb2 Rad8 (directed against White's potential c-pawn advance) 20.Be2 Qb7 21.Bf3 Be8 22.c4 Ne7 23.Rac1 Qb8 24.Rfd1 Bc6 with equal chances.

**15.b4**

Playing for the win. There is something Napoleonic in this line, with White's lust to expand and seize ever more territory.

15.Be2 Qa5 16.Bd1 repeats the position.

**15...O-O**

Tournament praxis also saw 15...Ba6 16.Nb2 Qc6 17.Ba4 Qc7 18.Kf2 Rc8 19.Rac1 Bc4 20.a3 b5 21.Nxc4 Qxc4 22.Qxc4 Rxc4 23.Bxb5 Rxf4+ 24.Kg3 Re4 25.c4 Ke7 26.cxd5 Nxe5 with a dynamically balanced ending, N.Mitkov-D.Shmeliov, Las Vegas 2007.

**16.Nb2 f6**

Principle: Create confrontation and open the position when leading in development.

**17.Ba4**

A new move.

The following year, Mitkov tried 17.Bg4 Re8 18.a4 Qc6 19.O-O Qc7 20.Rfe1 fxe5 21.fxe5 a5 22.Re3 Ba6 23.Rae1 axb4 24.cxb4 Rac8 25.h4 Qd8 26.Bh3 Qe7 27.Rf3 Bc4 28.b5 Qc5 29.Rf4 Qxd4+ 30.Rxd4 Kf7 31.h5 Ke7 , N.Mitkov-J.Alvarez, Cienfuegos 1996. Black stands slightly better since White must guard both the e5- and a4-pawns, as well as watch for potential rook infiltrations down the c-file.

**17...Qa6**

Still not allowing White to castle.

**18.Bc6 fxe5 19.fxe5 Rb8 20.Kd2?**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Natural tacticians and attackers somehow feel less than whole when defending an inferior position. The white king is the saloon patron in an old Western movie where the gunslinger and the sheriff shoot it out, while he dives for cover under a table. White just blundered on his last move, allowing Black to untangle and generate an explosive attack. How does the latter pull it off?

Correct was 20.a4 b5! 21.Bxd7 Bxd7 22.a5 Rbc8 23.Rf1 Be8 24.Rxf8+ Kxf8 25.Kd2 ( also, after 25.Nd3 Rc4 26.Qf2+ Kg8 27.Nc5 Qc6 28.Qf3 Qc7 29.Qe3 d4! 30.cxd4 Qe7 , Black threatens ...Qh4+ and also ...Rxb4, thus he doesn't stand worse ) 25...Bg6 with dynamic equality.

**20...Nc5!**

ANSWER: Double attack/discovered attack. --- Now appears a spontaneous flowering of Black's counterplay and the relative peace which had reigned terminates in a violent spasm.

**21.Ke3**

The pounding of the king's overburdened heart sounds like a construction crew working to repair the street.

21.bxc5?? is a massive blunder as after 21...bxc5 , Black has a killing discovered attack on the b2-knight while threatening White's queen and 22.Qxc5 Rxb2+ 23.Kc1 Qe2 leads to mate.

21.Nd3 Ne4+ 22.Ke1 b5! entombs White's bishop and forces White's next move. 23.Bxd5 exd5 24.Qxd5+ Be6 25.Qxe4 and though White regains his piece, it comes at a heavy cost to his king. Following 25...Qa3! 26.Rc1 ( 26.Ke2 Bc4 is also hopeless for White ) 26...Rbd8 , there is no defence to the dual threats: ...Rxd3 and ...Bf5.

**21...Bd7!**

"Did you really believe you could outwit me, your moral and mental superior?" Black's bishop asks his startled colleague. Small steps are often the preliminary to great deeds. Black finds ingenious methods of taxing the defence so that it has little chance to mend. The exchange of light-squared bishops punctures White's light squares.

**22.Bxd7**

22.bxc5 bxc5 23.Qa4 d4+! 24.cxd4 cxd4+ 25.Qxd4 Bxc6 and White's apprehended king has no chance of survival.

**22...Nxd7**

White's king is in deep trouble and his position is overextended, with weaknesses on e5, c4, c3 and a3.

**23.Rhe1**

23.a4 Rf5 picks off the e5-pawn and Black has a winning position.

**23...Qa3!**

With this queen infiltration pressing on the weakest point in White's position, Mitkov soon finds himself unable to fend off the continual threats.

**24.Re2 Rbc8 25.Kd3**

EXERCISE (combination alert): The fakir, through mysterious powers of meditative concentration, begins to levitate to the d3-square. Somehow White's pieces wove themselves into incoherence, drifting further away from the essence with each passing move. A potential combination hangs over White like a foul stench. This is the moment when dreams and reality merge. The glow of anticipation grows bright as we sense the presence of a crushing combination.

25.Rc2 g5! 26.g3 Rf5 is also crushing.

**25...Rf4!**

ANSWER: Deflection. Black's queen leaves the grunt work to her corps of low-level assistants. --- Previously, Black lived life on a modest scale. This is about to change, as his expenditures rise to support a lavish attacking lifestyle.

After 25...Rf4 26.Qxf4 , White's queen, who had lived under the mistaken assumption that splendours and acclaim will follow her in every action she takes, realizes that the f4-pest will enable the crushing blow 26...Qxc3# mate! Adversity either strengthens character or destroys; there is no middle ground. --- SUMMARY: 9 Be2 leads to positions synonymous with the previous game, except that Be2 has more justification than the less favourable a3. This change doesn't really help White much and we equalize here as well. The variations are similar, yet dissimilar, manifesting as separate currents in the same ocean.

### (39)Huebner, R.   --   Korchnoi, V. 22: San Francisco  1995   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

I thought about putting this game in Korchnoi: Move by Move (I urge the reader to immediately order this book and drink deeply of the nectar of its mental refreshment. I don't want to make untrue, crazy claims, but if you read this book, your life will change for the better and all your dreams will come true). Now I'm glad I didn't, since it fits perfectly in this one.

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qb6 9.Ncb5**

The 17th century philosopher and mathematician Leibniz wrote: "Once the characteristic numbers of most notions are determined, the human race will have a new kind of tool that will increase the power of the mind much more than optical lenses helped our eyes, a tool that will be as far superior to microscopes or telescopes as reason is to vision." Did Leibniz foresee the coming of computers? If so, he had it backwards. My theory: Comps actually enable us to grow more stupid with each passing day, since we don't require our intelligence to work out problems anymore. This position, for instance, has been utterly worked out by the comps to a forced draw, if Black wants one. Wouldn't it be better to live in a world where we actually had to work out such enigmas by ourselves, without being provided the comps' instantaneous answers to all our questions? Well, I'm pretty sure I wallow in a lonely minority in my pet peeve, anti-comp rhetoric here. I apologize for this diatribe but can't promise it won't happen again in some other book! --- QUESTION: What is the point of White's last move, since both the c7- and d6-squares are covered? --- ANSWER: White threatens Nf5 which simultaneously unpins the d4-knight and attacks Black's queen, while threatening to infiltrate on d6 with either knight.

**9...a6!**

Cold reason always looks upon a gamble with stern disapproval. This is why Mr. Spock had difficulty understanding Captain Kirk. Korchnoi isn't a man who backs down from a challenge. So he agrees to plunge head first into the complications. --- QUESTION: You just said White "threatens Nf5", didn't you? And now Korchnoi calmly allows it. --- ANSWER: Oops! My mistake. Maybe it's not such a 'threat' after all. --- QUESTION: In previous games in this chapter, Black nearly always played ...Bc5 in such situations. Can we do so here? --- ANSWER: Yes, your suggestion is also playable. In fact it is Black's only move if you want to play for a win, since the comps worked out Korchnoi's move to a draw.

9...Bc5 10.a3 transposes to positions we discussed in the notes of the previous game (Kamsky-So, Game 20).

**10.Nf5 Bc5 11.Bxc5?!**

A bored person may sometimes undertake grave risk, thinking "Death is a better fate than life at a standstill". Even though this move seems natural, it is inaccurate and White stands worse.

Let's examine the alternatives: 11.Nxg7+?? Kf8 12.Bxc5+ Nxc5 13.Nd6 Qb4+! 14.c3 Qxf4 15.Nxc8 Kxg7 16.Nb6 Qh4+ ! and White can resign since 17.g3 is met with 17...Qe4+ picking off the h1-rook.

Correct is 11.Nbd6+ Kf8 12.Qh5 Nd8 13.Nxg7 Bxe3!

not 13...Kxg7?? 14.Qg5+ Kf8 15.Bxc5 and the Black's queen is overloaded since d8 hangs<level/>

14.Qh6 Ke7 15.Ngf5+ exf5 16.Nxf5+ Ke8 17.Nd6+ Ke7 18.Nf5+ with perpetual check, R.Paramos Dominguez-F.Vallejo Pons, Palencia 1999. 

14.Nxe6+ (this move also forces perpetual check) 14...fxe6 ( risky is 14...Ke7 15.Qg5+ when 15...Kxe6?? 16.f5+ Kxe5 17.Qe7+ Kf4 18.Bd3 ensures that Black's king has no chance of survival ) 15.Qe8+ Kg7 16.Qe7+ Kg8 17.Qg5+ Kf8 18.Qh6+ Kg8 19.Qg5+ Kf8 . It seems to this king that his entire life has been a series of vexing harassments. With 20.Qh6+ , the scenario feels like a Jane Austen novel where the plain yet independent-minded heroine finds her rich, handsome man after 20...Kg8 . The game once again ends in perpetual check, D.Andreikin-N.Vitiugov, Tyumen 2012.

**11...Nxc5 12.Nbd6+**

Weakened dark squares for our side tend to be endemic to this line. We must simply accept it as a professional risk of playing the line itself.

**12...Kf8 13.Qh5?**

Threatening mate on the move. Now we catch a glimpse of the limitless panorama of White's attacking ambitions. White's reflections configure themselves into intent, bent on an all-or-nothing kingside assault. However, Huebner miscalculated, or at least hadn't seen as deeply into the position as Korchnoi. At a glance, White's game may feel free of confining or restrictive effects. Yet when examined closer, we discover evidence of just that. If Black manages to defend the mating threats, White ends up with a hanging knight on f5, as well as multiple loose pawns once Black's queen takes b2. In this case, White stubbornly refuses to divest himself from his plan, which evidence soon indicates, sours before our eyes.

White had to back down with 13.Nd4 Ne4! ( perhaps Black can try 13...Qxb2!? 14.Nxc6 Qc3+ 15.Kf2 bxc6 16.h4 when White has some compensation for the pawn but I'm not sure it's enough ) 14.Nxe4 , S.Khmelnitsky-V.Malykin, Kiev 1997. Now Black should play 14...Nxd4! 15.Nd6 Qxb2 16.Rb1 Qc3+ 17.Qd2 Nxc2+ 18.Kd1 Ne3+ 19.Ke2 Qxd2+ 20.Kxd2 Nxf1+ 21.Rhxf1 b5 . Houdini thinks the position is almost even and perhaps White's intolerable flaws are possibly counterbalanced by his virtues. As a human assessor, I doubt that White's massive developmental lead in the ending makes up for a two-pawn deficit.

**13...Nd8!**

White's two knights and queen look impressive, yet there is nothing to attack in Black's camp. Black on the other hand, threatens the f5-knight and the b2-pawn. White is already busted!

**14.Nxg7**

EXERCISE (critical decision): Huebner decides to burn incense on the altar of his attack. White's last move is based on the philosophy: "If you hope to prosper, capital must first be sunk in the initial investment." An attack can't be derived from fantasy alone. There must be some basis from the position which calls for it as well. In this instance, the sac falls short. But White had little choice since backing up to d4 simply drops a couple of pawns without compensation. Work out Black's most accurate sequence, after which he is winning. Should Black take the hanging g7-knight, or is there something better? Before us are two flasks. One contains a healing potion; the other poison. Which one will you swallow?

14.Nd4 loses without a fight after 14...Qb4+! 15.c3 Qxb2 16.Rd1 Qxc3+ when White doesn't have compensation for the missing pawns.

**14...Qb4+!**

ANSWER: Zwischenzug.

14...Kxg7?? loses to 15.Qg5+ Kf8 16.Qh6+ Ke7 ( 16...Kg8 17.Ne8 forces mate ) 17.Qf6+ Kd7 18.Qxh8 Qxb2 19.Rd1 Qxc2 20.Be2 .

**15.c3 Qxb2**

The b2-puncture is as noticeable as a missing tooth from an otherwise beautiful woman's smile.

**16.Rd1 Qxc3+**

The queen displays little diffidence in the matter of brutally executing all those who oppose her.

**17.Rd2**

EXERCISE (combination alert/critical decision): Should Black take the g7-knight now? What would you play here? --- ANSWER: Zwischenzug/double attack. Black first cuts off access to the critical g5-square, after which he really can take the now trapped knight.

**17...h6!**

Most definitely not 17...Kxg7?? when the king's lips curl into the faintest hint of a patronizing smile at his would-be killer's ineptitude. However, he fails to factor in the knight's accomplices. Following 18.Qg5+ Kf8 19.Qxd8+ Kg7 20.Qf6+ Kg8 , the king's eyes slowly widen, upon recognition of the person who will shortly take his life with 21.Qxf7# mate! "Glare at me all you like," Black's queen tells the king, adding, "As far as I know, no one ever glared another person to death."

**18.Nge8 Ne4!**

There is no defence after 18...Ne4 19.Nxe4 dxe4 as the double attack threat of both ...e3 and ...Kxe8 wins for Black. --- SUMMARY: The comps have defanged 9 Ncb5. Black can either force a draw or equalize and play on.

0-1

### (40)4: Old School Classical Line   --   ? ? ????   \* (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.--**<fen value="rnbqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 1"/>

What was once a forgotten discard is now back in fashion. In the Steinitz Old School Classical line, White's universe doesn't operate under rational laws. He or she declines to play f4 and in Hypermodern fashion, relies on piece play instead of pawns to control his or her centre, intending to respond to ...c5 with dxc5, and to ...f6 with exf6. The battle revolves around coalescence of the now cleared d4- and e5-squares:

1. If White manages to enforce some kind of iron blockade on the two squares, Black stands worse.

2. Conversely, if Black manages to take control and play ...e5, our centre rolls forward and we stand better in most cases.

As human beings, we can't help but project our contaminated feelings of "attractive" and "unattractive" on every position we analyse. In this case, perhaps your French Defence-loving writer may be sneaking in a little of his subjective bias. However, from my experience, I find that Bob Dylan's prediction of "The first one now, will later be last" tends to be a reality in this line. White almost always erects the initial blockade and yet if we remain patient, at some point we eventually wrest control over the e5-square and our centre will commence to roll forward.<fenend/>

### (41)Alvarez Pedraza, A.   --   Moskalenko, V. 23: Spanish League, Barcelona  2011   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

GM Viktor Moskalenko wrote in the Russian Roulette chapter of his book The Flexible French that this line is a dangerous and underestimated system from White's perspective. He also predicted a rise in popularity in the coming years.

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3**

This is the Two Knights move-order.

White can also reach our line with 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.Nf3 .

**2...d5**

2...c5 turns the game into a Sicilian, but that is another book.

**3.Nc3 Nf6**

3...d4 is also played here but I suggest we stick closer to pure French positions and avoid it.

**4.e5 Nfd7 5.d4**

The starting position of the Old School Classical system. This oddball line, favoured by daredevils, is now in style and follows the dictates of fashion. --- QUESTION: What is the point of avoiding f4? --- ANSWER: In the good old Romantic perior days, this was actually White's main line: 1. The idea is to support e5 with pieces, not pawns. --- 2. When Black plays ...c5, White responds with dxc5 and after ...f6, White plays exf6. --- QUESTION: But doesn't this obliterate White's pawn centre? --- ANSWER: It wipes out White's pawn centre, but not his or her control over the centre. White and Black fight furiously over the d4-square, but mainly for dominance of the e5-square. If White seizes control over the square, then he or she may look forward to planting a piece on e5. Black must see to it that this blockade either doesn't occur, or that Black receives some form of compensating counterplay, like maybe down the open f- and/or c-files.

**5...c5 6.dxc5**

All according to Hypermodern theory. White hands his opponent over the pawn centre to chip away at it, and attempt to control and blockade d4 and/or e5 with pieces.

Let's have a look at one alternative, 6.Bb5 : ( . A curious try is 6...c4!? as somehow I seem incapable of doing anything which fits the accepted norm. After 7.O-O a6 8.Bxd7+ Bxd7 , I later won by expanding on the queenside and fending off White's attempts on the other wing. As usual, Black's unopposed bad light-squared bishop played a prominent role in wresting control over the light squares later in the game, T.Smith-C.Lakdawala, San Diego 1985. ) ( . The standard move is 6...Nc6 7.O-O cxd4 8.Nxd4 : ( 8...Qc7 9.Re1 a6 10.Bxc6 bxc6 11.Bf4 Nb6 12.Qg4 c5 13.Nb3 h6 and I prefer Black, due to his strong pawn centre and bishop pair. This counterbalances White's space and developmental lead, A.Martorelli-A.Baburin, Saint Vincent 2000. ) ( . Black can also risk 8...Ndxe5 9.Bf4 a6 10.Bxe5 axb5 11.Bg3 Bc5 12.Ncxb5 O-O as he looks fine. Black has the bishop pair and the potential to later advance in the centre makes up for White's piece play and control over the b5-square. ( ) ) )

**6...Nc6 7.Bf4 Bxc5**

Later in the chapter, we will examine my favourite response 7...Nxc5 .

**8.Bd3 f6**

Black logically grinds away at the vestiges of White's pawn centre in Classical style.

QUESTION: Doesn't 8...Qb6 attack both f2 and b2, winning a pawn?

ANSWER: The pawn is poisoned: After 8...Qb6 9.O-O , now if Black proceeds with the suicidal 9...Qxb2?? , White gets a winning position after 10.Nb5 : ( 10...Kf8 11.Rb1! Qxa2 12.Ra1 Qb2 , A.Hermlin-M.Tuominen, Tampere 1994. Now White has 13.Bd2! (threat: Bc3) 13...d4 14.Qe2 and there is no reasonable defence to the coming Rfb1. ) ( 10...O-O 11.Bxh7+! Kh8 ( 11...Kxh7 12.Ng5+ Kg6 13.Qd3+ f5 14.exf6+ Kxf6 15.Rfb1 Nde5 16.Qe2 traps Black's queen ) 12.Rb1 Qxa2 13.Bd3 and Black's king is in mortal danger after Ng5 and Qh5/Qg4-h4 ideas. )

8...Nb4 was played in the very first game of this line which continued 9.O-O Nxd3 10.Qxd3 Be7 11.Nd4 Nf8? . Oh, if only I had the ability to build a time machine. I sigh wistfully at the thought of the delightful spankings I could deliver to the strategically-challenged players of that era! Anyway, Black somehow went on to win, J.Mason-F.Lee, London 1899.

8...h6 has been discussed on Chesspublishing.com but to my French eye, it doesn't appear logical. If Black wants this kind of position, he or she should take the 7...Nxc5 route, which saves tempi over this version. After 9.h4 a6 10.Qe2 b5 11.Rh3 Bf8 , now both ...Bxc5 and ...Bf8 have been wasted moves, M.Angelini-A.Stella, Biella 2012. Black would be up a couple of moves on this position had he chosen 7...Nxc5.<level start="7...Nxc5"/>

**9.exf6 Nxf6**

The main line.

Later in the chapter, we will look at 9...Qxf6 .

**10.Qe2**

This position is a hot new theoretical battleground. White logically keeps an eye on the e5-square and prepares to castle long. Moskalenko writes: "Not long ago a young Russian player, Alexander Zakharov, devised an interesting idea in this complex variation. This new idea, in my opinion, will soon be very popular, and can be useful for players who are looking for a real fight."

In the next game, we will look at the older and probably weaker 10.O-O move.

**10...O-O 11.O-O-O**

The motto of the Mad Max Thunderdome movie: Two men enter; one man leaves.

**11...a6**

11...Bd7 is also played here in equal proportion and called "the logical response" by Moskalenko: ( . White usually continues 12.Ne5 intending g4 and g5. After halting the g4 idea with 12...Bd6 , 13.Ng6!? ( 13.g4?? loses instantly to 13...Ne8! 14.Bg3 Qg5+ 15.f4 Rxf4 ) 13...Bxf4+ 14.Nxf4 Qa5 15.a3 Rae8 16.g4?! (this move creates serious structural concessions in pursuit of attack) 16...Qc7 17.Nh3 occurred in F.Bellini-D.Komarov, Reggio Emilia 2004. At this stage, Black can play 17...e5! 18.Nxd5 Nxd5 19.Bc4 Nd4 20.Bxd5+ Kh8 21.Qe4 Bxg4! 22.Rxd4 Bf5! 23.Rc4 Qd7 24.Qf3 Bxh3 25.Qd3 Rxf2 , winning a pawn. ) ( 12.h4 Rc8 13.h5 Nb4 14.Ne5 , I.Nepomniachtchi-M.Zumsande, Internet (blitz) 2005. It's anybody's game after 14...Be8 15.h6 g6 16.a3 Nxd3+ 17.Nxd3 Bxa3 18.bxa3 Rxc3 19.Qxe6+ Bf7 20.Qe5 d4 . ) ( 12.Kb1 Rc8 13.Ne5 Be8 14.Nxc6 Rxc6 15.Na4 Be7 16.Bb5 Ne4 17.f3 Rxf4 18.fxe4 Rd6 19.Bxe8 Qxe8 20.Nc3 d4 21.g3 Rf8 22.e5 Rd8 23.Ne4 Qc6 24.Rhe1 Rd5 25.Nf2 and a dynamically balanced game is reached, I.Nepomniachtchi-S.Volkov, Tomsk 2006. If White plays his knight to d3, Black can weave his bishop into e3 via g5. )

**12.Ne5**

This move knocks out ...Nh5 possibilities.

12.Kb1 Bd7 13.Ne5 Nxe5 ( 13...Bd6?? fails miserably to 14.Nxc6 Bxc6 15.Qxe6+ ) 14.Bxe5 is perhaps stronger with both sides initiating pawn storms after 14...b5 15.g4 , leading to a complex fight.

**12...Bd6!**

Given an exclamation mark by IM John Watson. Black must fight for control over the e5-square. In doing so, he pins the e5-knight.

**13.Bg3**

White stabilizes his bishop.

A casual move like 13.Kb1? walks into 13...Qc7! 14.Nxc6 Bxf4 with a clear advantage to Black, who now owns the bishop pair and dominates the dark squares.

**13...Qc7 14.Ng4**

Already, White must be careful here: 14.Nxc6?! makes no sense as it only opens the b-file for Black's rooks and queen. After 14...bxc6 15.Rhe1 , we reached M.Iounoussov-R.Woller, Recklinghausen 2001. Black stands clearly better after 15...c5 , threatening ...Bxg3 followed by ...c4.

White can't simply back up the knight with 14.Rhe1? Nxe5 15.Bxe5 Bxe5 16.Qxe5 Qxe5 17.Rxe5 as 17...Ng4 wins a pawn.

**14...Nxg4**

Watson suggests 14...Bf4+!? 15.Kb1 Bd7 16.Nxf6+ Rxf6 with an equal game.

would simply ignore White and develop with 14...Bd7 instead, planning to generate queenside counterplay.

**15.Qxg4 Ne5 16.Qd4**

Worthy of consideration is 16.Qh4 g6!? 17.Rhe1 Bd7 18.Qd4 Nf7 19.Kb1 Rae8 20.Bxd6 Qxd6 21.f4! and White stands slightly better. This is the kind of dark-square blockade/bind White is after in this line, S.Satyapragyan-F.Franciosi, Livigno 2012.

**16...Bd7 17.Rhe1**

White must fight for control of the e5-square.

**17...Nxd3+ 18.Rxd3 Rac8**

A new move, which looks more logical than 18...Bxg3 19.hxg3 Rac8 20.f4 b5 21.Rd2 with an even game, O.Kalinina-A.Balaian, Dnipropetrovsk 2013.

**19.a3 b5**

Black continues to press on with his queenside attack.

**20.Kb1 Rf7 21.Ree3**

White seems to be waiting.

Watson suggests 21.Bxd6 Qxd6 22.g3 with the idea of f4. Now Black can continue 22...Rc4 23.Qe3 d4 24.Ne4 Qd5 25.Qd2 e5 26.f4 Bf5 27.Qg2 (cheapo alert: Nf6+ is threatened) 27...Rd7 28.fxe5 Qxe5 when I prefer Black's position since his bishop looks better than the knight and Black generates pressure on the c2-pawn.

**21...Qc5!**

Moskalenko continues to harass the blockaders.

**22.Bxd6 Qxd6 23.Rf3 Be8**

23...Rc4 24.Qa7 Re7 25.Rfe3 h6 looks balanced.

**24.Rxf7?!**

White begins to lose the thread after this move.

I think the time has come for vigorous action with 24.Ne4!? (given an exclamation mark by Watson) 24...Qxh2 25.Ng5 Rxf3 26.Rxf3 Qd6 27.Re3 Bd7 28.Qd3 g6 29.Qd4 Rf8 30.Nf3 Rf4 31.Qa7 . It looks to me that White, with his central dark-square control, gets full compensation for the pawn. If Black attempts to smash the blockade with 31...d4 32.Rd3 e5 , then White has the trick 33.Nxe5 Qxe5 34.Qxd7 Rxf2 35.Rxd4 with an equal game.

**24...Bxf7 25.Re3?!**

Taking on a risk like this is the equivalent of what the man, who proposes to a woman he doesn't love, is gambling with to win a bet with a friend. The e5-blockade isn't worth a pawn.

White should play 25.Rg3 Bg6 26.Re3 Rc4 27.Qe5 Qxe5 28.Rxe5 Kf7 29.f3 a5 30.Re2 b4 31.Nb5 Rxc2 32.Rxc2 b3 33.Nd4 a4 34.Kc1 bxc2 35.Nxc2 e5 36.b4! axb3 37.Na1 when White's outside passed a-pawn should save him in the ending.

**25...Bg6?!**

Well, they say faintheartedness is the better part of low-blood pressure. Fog doesn't last forever and one day the bishop hopes for a clear sky. The bishop nudges his way in, intruding upon White's sphere of influence. Yet the move is mistimed. I don't get it that neither side thinks the h2-pawn is worth saving or taking.

Black should accept the challenge with 25...Qxh2! 26.Rg3 Qh1+ 27.Ka2 g6 28.Qe5 Qc1 29.Ne2 Qxc2 30.Nd4 Qc4+ 31.Kb1 a5 32.Nxe6 Qe4+ 33.Qxe4 dxe4 34.Ng5 Bd5 when Black has excellent winning chances.

**26.g3!**

Idea: f4 - to clamp down on the dark squares.

The immediate 26.f4? Rc4 27.Qe5 Qxe5 28.Rxe5 Rxf4 29.Rxe6 d4 30.Nd5 Rf1+ 31.Ka2 Bxc2 favours Black.

**26...Rc6 27.f4**

QUESTION: Isn't White clearly better here? After all, he achieved his dream blockade and stuck Black with a bad bishop, fixed on the same colour as its pawns. --- ANSWER: All the factors you listed are correct, yet I think it is Black who stands better. This is yet another case of the not-so-bad bishop. In fact, let's turn this position into an exercise. --- EXERCISE (planning): How can Black take over the initiative and prove that his bad bishop is in reality a good bishop? You are the pilot. Which direction shall we take?

**27...h6?!**

Procrastination - putting off the job for tomorrow - is a dangerous business in a chess game, simply because tomorrow brings with it unforeseen contingencies.

ANSWER: Activate the queenside pawns and target c2 with 27...a5! : ( 28.Nxb5 Bxc2+ 29.Ka2 Qb8! 30.Nc3 a4! 31.Re2 Rc4 32.Qe5 Bb3+ 33.Kb1 Qxe5 34.fxe5 ( 34.Rxe5?? is met with 34...d4 35.Ne4 d3 36.Rxe6 Rd4! with dual threats of chopping the e6-rook and setting up the...d2 advance ) 34...Kf7 and White is in serious trouble. His pieces are badly tied down and his queenside light squares weak. ) ( 28.Re2?? b4 29.axb4 axb4 30.Nd1 b3 31.Ne3 Rc8! threatens to swing the queen to a6 and then to a2. After 32.Kc1 Qa6 33.Kd2 bxc2 , White's position is resignable. )

**28.Re2 Rc4 29.Qe5 Qxe5 30.Rxe5 Kf7**

White seems to have most of his defensive issues under control. Yet, there remains residue which he is unable to eradicate. The advantage tilts towards Black as: 1. His bad bishop is superior to White's unimpressive knight. As the game progresses, we soon see that this is an unequal relationship, since in an ending, a bishop is an amphibious creature, equally adaptable to offence and defence. The same can't be said for a clumsy knight, who is capable of one or the other, but not both. --- 2. He threatens to exert pressure on the c2-pawn, via ...a5 and ...b4. --- 3. His king is active and may later infiltrate the kingside light squares.

**31.h4?!**

Now the weakened light squares fester and proliferate, like the spread of weeds in an overgrown garden. Perhaps White fears the plan: ...Kf6, ...Bf5 and ...g5. But his last move creates new light square gashes on the kingside.

**31...Bf5 32.h5 Kf6 33.Re2 Rc5!**

Intending ...a5!.

**34.Re5?!**

White should try 34.Na2! a5 35.Nc1 Rc4 36.Nd3 Bg4 37.Re5 b4 38.axb4 axb4 39.Kc1 b3 40.c3 Ra4 41.Re1 Ra5! 42.Kd2 Bxh5 43.c4! dxc4 44.Ne5 with chances to save the game.

**34...Rc6?!**

A move lacking intensity of purpose. Hey, I said "Intending ...a5!"

Moskalenko continues to miss the powerful idea and settles for a cheap substitute. With 34...a5! 35.Re2 b4 36.Na4 Rxc2! 37.Rxc2 b3 38.Kc1 bxc2 39.b4 axb4 40.axb4 Ke7 41.Nc5 Kd6 42.Nb3 Bg4 43.Kxc2 Bxh5 , Black should take the full point.

**35.Re2 Rc5 36.Re5 Rc4?!**

Does 36...a5! look familiar to you?

**37.Re3?**

37.Re2 was necessary.

**37...a5!**

Hooray! What White believed to be a simple training exercise, turns out to be the real war.

**38.Nxb5**

38.Re2 b4 39.axb4 axb4 40.Nd1 d4! leaves White helpless against the threats of ...b3 and ...d3.

**38...Bxc2+**

The triumphant bishop oozes happiness. So much so that everyone around wishes he would cease and desist with his infernal whistling of the song Born Free.

**39.Ka2**

The king, a startled tortoise retreating into his shell, dives for cover.

**39...a4!**

Black's success is only due to this indispensible adjunct. One black pawn fixes two of its white counterparts. Black is almost the equivalent of two pawns up here.

**40.Re1 d4**

The overachieving d-pawn's lowly rank does not commensurate with its extraordinary abilities.

**41.Nd6 Rc6 42.Ne4+ Kf5 43.Nf2 d3 44.Re5+ Kf6 45.Ne4+ Kf7 46.Nd2**

The listless knight mopes about in his unpleasant blockading duties, lost in a growing depression.

46.Rb5 Bb3+ 47.Rxb3 axb3+ 48.Kxb3 g6! 49.g4 gxh5 50.gxh5 e5! This move creates an entry path for Black's king. 51.fxe5 ( after 51.f5 , Black breaks through with 51...Rc1 52.a4 Re1 53.Nd2 e4 54.a5 e3 55.Nf3 d2 ) 51...Ke6 and Black wins.

**46...Bb3+!**

The bishop's rapturous intake of breath follows the bliss of arriving at the end of his holy pilgrimage. "You both will always remain forever in my shadow, little men," he gloats to White's king and knight.

**47.Kb1**

White's king, accustomed to a life of bustle and activity, now lies motionless in a ditch, paralyzed from the neck down.

Likewise, after 47.Nxb3 axb3+ 48.Kxb3 d2 , neither king nor rook can halt the promotion.

**47...Rc2**

The d2-blockade is smashed. "As you can see, the king is indisposed," indicates the rook, as he points to White's poisoned king. "So I shall be acting as regent for the indefinite future," he adds.

**48.Nxb3 axb3 49.Re1 Re2! 50.Rc1 d2**

and ...Re1 follows. --- SUMMARY: Currently the Russian Roulette line 10 Qe2, is gaining in popularity. But remember, we don't have to enter this line if we don't care for Black's position. This line only arises from the 9...Nxf6 line. We avoid this line entirely in the last four games of this chapter.

0-1

### (42)Schneider, I.   --   Ulibin, M. 24: Biel  2004   0-1   C00 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.d4 c5 6.dxc5 Nc6 7.Bf4 Bxc5 8.Bd3 f6 9.exf6 Nxf6 10.O-O**

The old main line. White plays it safe and castles kingside. According to theory, Black stands well after this move.

**10...O-O 11.Ne5 Bd7 12.Qe2**

QUESTION: What about the plan of exchanging on c6 to dominate the e5-square? --- ANSWER: As we saw in the previous game, Black sometimes allows White to control the e5-square and simply seeks counterplay elsewhere.

Black would continue 12.Nxc6 Bxc6 13.Qe2 Qe7 14.Rae1 Rae8 15.Bg3 a6 16.a3 as in B.Spassky-T.Petrosian, Moscow 1966. Now Black can play 16...e5! 17.Bxe5 ( 17.Qxe5?? which is met with the crushing overload shot 17...Bxf2+! when White loses material, no matter how he responds. For example, 18.Rxf2 Qc5! wins for Black ) 17...Qf7 18.Qd1 Ne4 19.Bxe4 Bxf2+ 20.Kh1 dxe4 21.Bd6 Bxe1! 22.Rxf7 Rxf7 23.Qxe1 e3 24.Bg3 e2 25.Nxe2 Rfe7 and White is busted, since the knight is toast and soon the crucial g2-pawn will follow suit with devastating effect.

**12...Qe7 13.Rae1 Rae8 14.a3**

To prevent both ...Nb4 and ...Bb4 ideas in the future.

**14...a6 15.Bg3 Nxe5**

The correct moment to exchange, since White loses a tempo by moving his bishop once again to recapture.

**16.Bxe5 Bc6 17.b4!?**

I don't like this unnecessary weakening. --- QUESTION: I would play the same move since I don't see a plan for White here. What would you suggest?

ANSWER: White should remove his king from the g1-a7 diagonal and prepare f4 with 17.Kh1 . Even then, I prefer Black's game after 17...g6 18.Nd1 Nd7 19.Bg3 e5 . It's amazing how often White eventually loses control over this key square. After 20.f3 b5 , Black has a comfortable game, D.Johansen-C.Thomson, Edinburgh 1985.

**17...Bb6 !?**

A new move. The bishop refuses to vacate its diagonal and continues to eye the f2-pawn menacingly.

QUESTION: Shouldn't Black challenge e5 with 17...Bd6 ? --- ANSWER: Your suggestion is also playable. After 18.f4 Bxe5 19.fxe5!? ( 19.Qxe5 Nd7 20.Qd4 Qh4 21.Ne2 e5 22.fxe5 Rxf1+ 23.Rxf1 Qxd4+ 24.Nxd4 Nxe5 looks equal ) 19...Nd7 20.Rxf8+ Rxf8 21.Qg4 Rc8 22.Qd4 Nf8 23.Ne2 Bb5 24.Bxb5 axb5 25.Qd3 Rc4 26.Nd4 Qh4 27.Rd1 Qh5 28.Re1 Qh4 29.Rd1 Qf4 30.Nxb5 Qxe5 , Black's central majority looks more promising than White's on the queenside, G.Masternak-M.Kaminski, Wisla 1998. --- Ulibin, however, decides his dark-squared bishop exerts more pressure on the f2-pawn, than its e5-counterpart's impact on the black kingside.

**18.b5?**

After his wild thrust, the self-inflicted structural damage cannot be undone and it's too late to mourn lost opportunities. Raging emotions during a game is the great destroyer of sound judgement. White mistakes the ridge of the mountain for the summit by sacrificing structure on the altar of heightened activity. Perhaps he also harbours a simple hunger for adventure. In this case, it transpires that only gratuitous violence has been served. White obtained a bad deal since the slight increase in activity doesn't make up for the permanent structural damage.

Once again, White should play the calm 18.Kh1 intending f4.

**18...axb5 19.Nxb5**

EXERCISE (planning): Black found a powerful method of taking over the initiative. Come up with a plan. --- ANSWER: Deflection/target f2-pawn. Black diverts White's bishop from control over the e4-square, after which he plays ...Ne4, with overwhelming pressure exerted on the f2-pawn.

**19...Bxb5! 20.Bxb5**

Now, despite the fact that the rook on e8 is hanging, Black is able to punish his opponent for neglecting the important e4-square.

**20...Ne4!**

No need to move the e8-rook since the f2-pawn hangs. Destiny isn't always a blind dispenser of our suffering and such combinations tend to be rooted in the effects of strategic precedent, which in this case, White himself planted moves ago.

**21.Bg3**

Enforced passivity,

since after 21.Bxe8? Rxf2 22.Rxf2 Bxf2+ 23.Kh1 Bxe1 24.Qxe1 Qxe8 25.c4 Qc6 26.cxd5 Qxd5 , White is down a pawn for no compensation.

**21...Rd8 22.Bd3 Nxg3 23.hxg3 Rf6**

Dual purpose: White covers the e6-pawn and prepares to double rooks to press on the tender f2-pawn. Also the presence of opposite-coloured bishops greatly favours the attacker - in this case, obviously Black.

**24.g4?**

White's position disintegrates after this move.

He had to try 24.Qh5 g6 25.Qh4 e5 26.c4 Rdf8 27.cxd5 Bxf2+ 28.Rxf2 Qc5 29.Rxe5 Rxf2 30.Kh2 when Black should win in any case.

**24...Rdf8 25.Bf5**

White relied on this trick but Black easily deals with it.

**25...Kh8! 26.Qe5**

EXERCISE (combination alert): The preliminaries have come to a conclusion and now it's time for the attack to begin in earnest. Black has two methods of winning. Find one of them.

26.Bxe6 Rxf2 27.Rxf2 Bxf2+ 28.Qxf2 Rxf2 29.Kxf2 Qf6+ 30.Kg1 g6 is also hopeless for White.

**26...Qc5!**

. ANSWER: Unpin and target the f2-pawn. --- The queen rudely presses a finger to each of her eyes, with mock tears for White's king. Defence of the f2-square/pawn is a sacred trust in this line, to which White didn't pay sufficient dues.

After 26...Qc5 27.Bd3 Rxf2 28.Kh2 , the king looks about every which way for safe-conduct from the danger zone. Following 28...Rxf1 29.Rxf1 Rxf1 30.Bxf1 , the white queen is captured after 30...Bc7 . "Can't we let bygones be bygones?" asks the queen, with a weak smile and an ingratiating whine, to which the bishop responds with a hearty laugh.

ANSWER #2: 26...Bc7! also wins. The bishop flashes a conspiratorial smile to his queen. Following 27.Qc3 , the queen blushes, the way I used to in college, when reading one of my rambling short stories, under the critical gaze of an unamused professor. Finally, the unpinning/double attacking 27...Qd6! forces White to lose his bishop, since mate is threatened on h2. --- SUMMARY: You don't have to contest for the e5-square in this line. It is also possible to simply allow White full control over the square and just play around it.

0-1

### (43)Morozevich, A.   --   Bareev, E. 25: Sarajevo, Bosnia  1999   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.Nf3 c5 6.dxc5 Nc6 7.Bf4 Bxc5 8.Bd3 f6 9.exf6 Qxf6**

Moskalenko doesn't cover this move in The Flexible French. To me, it actually looks more logical than recapturing with the knight. --- QUESTION: What are the plusses and minuses of recapturing on f6 with the queen? --- ANSWER: 1. Black gains an immediate tempo on the f4-bishop. --- 2. Black continues to fight for control over the e5-square, unlike the 9...Nxf6 line, which cedes at least temporary control over e5. --- 3. By recapturing with the queen, Black does nothing to untangle his queenside by leaving the d7-culprit where it stands. But, I will add that the Nd7 isn't as awful as it looks, since Black can later play ...Nc5 and ...Nxd3, both untangling and picking off the bishop pair.

**10.Bg5**

QUESTION: You listed one of the benefits of 9...Qf6 as a tempo gain on the f4-bishop. Yet here we see that it is Black who actually loses a tempo in return. Can you explain this discrepancy? --- ANSWER: White does indeed regain the tempo but at a cost. --- 1. White's bishop gets diverted from control over the key e5-square. --- 2. When Black's queen backs off to f7, it conveniently releases the f6-square for the misplaced d7-knight. --- 3. On f7, Black's queen continues to add heat down the sensitive f-file towards f2, White's traditionally most sensitive square in this variation.

QUESTION: If this is the case, then how about 10.Bg3 , which continues to leave Black's d7-knight in limbo. How does Black unravel in this case? --- ANSWER: Like this: After 10...O-O , we branch off with: ( 11.O-O a6 12.Qe2 and we have the following alternatives: ( . Black can clear the f6-square for the knight with 12...Qh6!? Clearing f6 for the knight. 13.Rae1 Nf6 14.Na4 Ba7 15.Bd6 Re8 16.Ne5 Nxe5 17.Qxe5 as seen in S.Vega Gutierrez-A.Strikovic, Benidorm 2007. It appears as if White gained the advantage since he initiated an e5-clamp. But this isn't the reality as Black can now play 17...Ng4! 18.Qg3 e5! and if 19.Rxe5 ( 19.Bxe5 Bd7 20.Bf4 g5 21.Rxe8+ Rxe8 22.Bd2 Nxf2 23.Rxf2 Bxa4 24.Kh1 Bxf2 25.Qxf2 Qh5 26.h3 Bb5! 27.Qd4 Bxd3 28.Qxd5+ Qf7 29.Qxd3 h6 and White doesn't have enough compensation for the exchange ) 19...Nxe5 20.Bxe5 Bd7 21.Nc3 Bc6 and Black stands slightly better, being an exchange up for a pawn. ) ( . Another viable plan for Black is 12...Nd4 13.Nxd4 Bxd4 14.Rae1 Nc5 15.Bd6 Nxd3 16.Qxd3 Bd7!? 17.Bxf8 Rxf8 . Black actually has full compensation for the exchange, since he threatens the f2-pawn and also possesses the trick of chopping the c3-knight, followed by ...Bb5. ) ) ( 11.Qe2 intending to castle queenside can be met with 11...Bb4 12.O-O Bxc3 13.bxc3 e5 14.Bb5 e4 15.Nd4 Nb6 16.a4 Nxd4 17.cxd4 a6 18.a5 axb5 19.Be5 Qg6 20.axb6 Rxa1 21.Rxa1 Qxb6 . Black's extra pawn probably doesn't mean too much but at least it's a extra one. I prefer Black as I don't think White benefits from the opposite-coloured bishops in this case since Black's king feels adequately protected. )

**10...Qf7 11.Qe2 O-O 12.O-O-O**

White elects to take the dynamic path.

After 12.O-O h6 13.Bh4 Nf6 14.Bg3 Nh5 15.Nh4 Nxg3 16.hxg3 Qf6 17.Ng6 Rd8 , A.Von Wright-T.Vihinen, Finland 2013, Black, who owns the bishop pair and the stronger centre, looks slightly better after 18.Rae1 Bd7 .

**12...h6 13.Bh4**

Black also looks at least equal after 13.Bd2 Bd6 14.Kb1 a6 15.h4 Nc5 intending ...b5 and ...b4. White's trouble is he can't play for the thematic attacking idea g4 and g5, since the f3-knight is loose.

**13...a6**

13...Bb4! looks awkward for White: ( 14.Nb5 a6 15.Nc7 Qf4+ 16.Kb1 Qxc7 and some bizarre reason, White resigned prematurely here in I.Deseatnicov-T.Radjabov, Oropesa del Mar 1999. He probably overlooked the resource 17.Qxe6+ Rf7 ( 17...Kh8 is met with 18.Qg6 Nf6 19.Bxf6 gxf6 20.Qxh6+ Kg8 when White has at least practical chances for the piece ) 18.Bh7+! Kf8 19.Qxd5 with some compensation for the piece. Houdini only rates this at -0.63, worse for White but clearly not resignable. ) ( 14.Bg3 has been tried but I just don't buy this continuation. White's dark-square control compensates for the damage to his king's structure after 14...Bxc3 15.bxc3 Qe7 16.Rhe1 Nc5 . )

**14.Bg3**

Adding to the control of the e5-square.

Alternatively, White can tuck the king in with 14.Kb1 Bb4 ( of course not 14...e5?? when 15.Nxd5 pilfers a pawn since the knight can't be taken due to 16 Bh7+ or 16 Bc4 ) 15.Rhe1 Bxc3 16.bxc3 e5 , P.Wongwichit-R.Song, Mount Buller 2005. At this stage, White should go for 17.c4 e4 18.cxd5 exd3 19.Qxd3 Nb4 20.Qd4 a5 21.a3 Na6 22.Re7 Qg6 23.d6 Nac5 24.Ne5 Nxe5 25.Qxc5 Nd7 26.Qc4+ Kh8 27.Rd3! and White adds another attacker into the fray with full compensation for the piece. After 27...Rg8 28.Rg3 Qxd6 29.Qxg8+! Kxg8 30.Rgxg7+ , perpetual check exacts a truce.

**14...Nb6**

Once again Bareev spurns 14...Bb4!? , unwilling to hand over dark-square control to Morozevich in exchange for damage to White's structure - a sign of great respect for Moro's fearsome abilities in irrational positions.

**15.Kb1 Bd7**

At long last, the ignored c8-bishop emerges and Black finally connects his rooks.

**16.Rhf1**

QUESTION: Wouldn't it be more logical to play the rook to e1 instead? --- ANSWER: White wants to play Ne5 but the trouble is that the f2-pawn is loose. So White overprotects the square to enable Ne5.

**16...Qh5 17.a3**

Cutting out both ...Bb4 and ...Nb4.

17.Ne5? hangs a pawn after 17...Qxe2 18.Nxe2 Nxe5 19.Bxe5 Rxf2 when once again, defence of the f2-pawn proves to be a headache for White.

**17...Rac8 18.Rde1**

Again contemplating Ne5.

**18...Rf6 19.Qd2**

On the immedate 19.Ne5 , Black achieves at least an equal ending after 19...Qxe2 20.Rxe2 Bd4! 21.Nxc6 Rxc6 22.Nd1 Nc4 .

**19...Qf7**

How infuriating for White. Bareev again discourages Ne5 by adding force to press the f2-pawn.

**20.Ne5?!**

Strained silence breaks in a hostile gesture, with White expending surplus energy by going after Black's king. The spirit may be willing but sometimes the flesh refuses to cooperate with logic's directives. I realized long ago that if I point my finger to an object, my dogs only look at the finger, never the object. As chess players we all suffer such myopic bouts from time to time. Such markedly hostile gestures come with risk and cost, and White faces dire consequences if his attack or initiative should grow cold. Moro loses patience or perhaps overestimates his position and thus offers a semi-dubious pawn sac.

This move is an indicator of White's dissatisfaction with his options: 20.Re2 is met with the exchange sac 20...Rxf3! 21.gxf3 Nd4 22.Re3 Nf5 23.Bxf5 ( 23.Re2 Nd4 repeats the position with a draw ) 23...Bxe3 24.Qxe3 Nc4 25.Bxe6 Bxe6 26.Qd4 Qxf3 27.Rg1 Qf6 28.Qxf6 gxf6 and White has no useful discoveries and the position is a likely draw. Still, this was White's best path since the way he played in the game left him struggling.

20.Ne2 Qf8 , eyeing a sacrifice on the a3-pawn, looks slightly unpleasant for White, who has no useful way to build his position.

**20...Nxe5 21.Bxe5 Rxf2 22.Qd1 Qe7 23.Rxf2 Bxf2 24.Rf1 Bc5 25.Qh5**

This is the position Morozevich envisioned when he offered the pawn. Most of his pieces take direct aim at Black's king. Yet the comps don't think much of White's attack and Black's king observes the coming attacking wave with the apocryphal nonchalance of Sir Francis Drake - who was allegedly playing a game of bowls on Plymouth Hoe when he was warned of the approach of the Spanish fleet. His blas? reply that there was plenty of time to finish the game and still beat the Spaniards.

**25...Rf8**

Principle: Swap down when ahead in material.

Black's move is more ambitious than 25...Be8 26.Qg4 Nd7 27.Re1 Nxe5 28.Rxe5 Bd7 29.Bf5! exf5 30.Rxe7 fxg4 31.Rxd7 Rf8 32.Rxd5 Rf1+ 33.Rd1 Rxd1+ 34.Nxd1 Bg1 35.h3 gxh3 36.gxh3 with the advantage to Black, since the bishop is clearly superior to White's knight in this opposite wing pawn majority ending.

**26.Re1 Qg5!**

"Your childish attempts to wrest power from me are vain imaginings," Black's queen tells her sister. Bareev applies the same swapping principle.

**27.Qxg5**

The queen's formerly exalted frame of mind undergoes a bit of downsizing. White's would-be attack peters out, now completely detached from its original context.

He doesn't have much choice but to concede to Black's demands since he loses the initiative after 27.Qh3? and the internal parts and gears of White's vast attacking machinery fail to mesh and function smoothly after 27...Nc4 28.Bxc4 dxc4 when Black has the initiative, the bishop pair and an extra pawn. Both ...Bc6 and ...Rf5 are in the air.

**27...hxg5 28.b4!?**

Morozevich is willing to weaken the c4-square in return for greater control over the d4-square.

**28...Be7 29.Ne2**

Rerouting the knight to the now blockaded d4-square.

**29...Rc8**

Intending ... Nc4.

**30.Nd4 Nc4 31.Bxc4 Rxc4**

Now Black adds the bishop pair to his growing portfolio of advantages. White hopes his iron, central dark-square blockade can compensate for his missing pawn, but to little avail.

**32.Kb2 Kf7 33.c3**

33.Nb3 Ba4 34.c3 Bxb3 35.Kxb3 Bf6 and Black has excellent chances of converting his extra pawn.

**33...Bf6 34.g3?!**

Weakening the h2-pawn, to which Bareev immediately pounces. Moro overestimates his powers of recuperation in what is still a difficult position.

**34...Rc8**

Heading for h8.

**35.Re2 Rh8**

Threat: ...Bxe5, followed by ...Rxh2+.

**36.Bd6**

Intending Nf3 and Ne5+, which Bareev prevents with his next move.

**36...g4! 37.Nb3**

EXERCISE (planning): How did Bareev smash the e5-blockade? --- ANSWER: Pin.

**37...e5!**

As so often happens in the Classical French, it is Black who is the final heir to owning the e5- square.

**38.Nc5**

38.Bxe5?? is met with 38...Re8 39.Nc5 Bc6 40.Nd3 Bb5 when the second pin destroys White.

**38...Bb5 39.Rf2**

White threatens both the e5- and b7-pawns. Bareev finds a solution.

**39...b6! 40.a4 Bc4 41.Nd7 Ke6 42.Nxf6 gxf6**

Black got to straighten out his formerly damaged pawn structure, at the cost of giving White drawing chances due to presence of the opposite-coloured bishops.

**43.Bc7 b5 44.a5**

An assessment of the aftermath: 1. Black is up a pawn. --- 2. Black owns a massive central pawn majority, owns a passed e-pawn, and can create new passers with a future ...d4, or with the ...f5-f4 break. --- 3. White's rook is passively tied down to defence of the h2-pawn. --- 4. Black's king is more actively placed than his counterpart and may be able to infiltrate the kingside light squares in the future. --- 5. Every White pawn on the board is fixed on the wrong colour of his remaining bishop. --- 6. The presence of opposite-coloured bishops greatly enhances White's drawing potential. --- Conclusion: Black accumulated too many advantages for the opposite-coloured bishops to overcome and we soon discover that White's blockading fortress isn't an insuperable obstacle to Black's hopes.

**44...Bd3 45.Bb6 Be4 46.Rd2 f5 47.Rf2 Rh3 48.Bc7 Bf3 49.Kc2 Rh7! 50.Bb6**

Most definitely not 50.Bb8?? Rb7 when White's bishop is trapped.

**50...f4**

At last, Black achieves his thematic break.

**51.gxf4 exf4 52.Kd3 Ke5 53.Bd4+**

The insubordinate bishop dares to make rude comments in the powerful black king's presence but his insolence is merely temporal.

**53...Kf5 54.Bb6 Rh6?!**

Missing a winning idea is a lot like buying a winning lottery ticket and then not bothering to cash it in to claim our fortune.

The seeds of the defence are not given enough time to germinate after 54...Be4+! 55.Kd2 Rh3! 56.Bd4 Bf3 57.Bb6 ( 57.Kd3?? loses to 57...Bg2+ 58.Kd2 Rxh2 ) 57...Ke4 58.Bc7 g3 . Once this move is achieved, White's chances to save himself plummet after 59.hxg3 fxg3 60.Rf1 Rh2+ 61.Kc1 Rg2 and Black threatens ...Ke3 and ...Ke2. Following 62.Bb6 Re2 63.Rg1 g2 64.Rd1 Kf4 65.Bc7+ Kg4 66.Rg1 Rf2 (threat: ...Rf1+) 67.Bb6 Rf1+ 68.Kd2 Kh3 69.Ba7 Kh2 , it is curtains for White.

**55.Ba7 Re6**

55...Rh3! is once again Black's most efficient plan.

**56.Kd2 Ke4**

"Silence!" demands the mad king, "Enough of your pitiful outpourings!" He believes himself to be the universal agent of natural selection. Looking down with disapproval upon White's incompetent defenders, he adds "I deem you unfit to survive."

**57.Rf1 Rh6 58.Bg1 Kf5 59.Re1 Be4 60.Re2 Rh3!**

Now Bareev finds the correct path.

**61.Bd4 g3 62.hxg3 fxg3 63.Re1 Rh2+ 64.Ke3 Rf2?**

The implementation of Black's plan isn't flowing according to script.

Stronger is 64...Kg4! 65.Rg1 Ra2 66.Rf1 g2 67.Rg1 Bf3 68.Kd3 Kg3 69.Be5+ Kh3 70.Bd4 Kh2 when Black's forces encroach upon g1, the way hungry, stray dogs are attracted to the smell of roasting meat from a backyard barbecue. 71.Be3 Be4+ 72.Kd4 Re2! and the prehensile rook's reach covers every direction. There is no defence to ...Rxe3.

**65.Bg7?**

White can't seem to find a way to clean up the mess.

He has chances to hold in the line 65.Rg1! Kg4 66.Be5 Bg2 67.Bd6 Rc2 68.Kd4 Re2 69.Kc5 Kh3 70.Kb6 Kh2 71.Bc5 Re6+ 72.Ka7 Be4 73.Rd1 g2 74.Bb6 Bf3 75.Ra1 Be2! 76.Re1 Re4! 77.Rg1 ( 77.Kxa6 s met with 77...Bf1 78.Rd1 d4! (interference!) 79.Rxd4 g1=Q 80.Rxe4 Qg3 and Black should win ) 77...Rc4 78.Kxa6 Rxc3 and the presence of the newly passed a-pawn offers White counterplay.

**65...Kg4**

Now Black is winning again.

**66.Rg1 Rf7 67.Bd4 g2 68.Re1 Rf1 69.Ke2 Kh3 70.Bg1**

EXERCISE (planning): How did Black smash White's blockade? --- ANSWER:

**70...Bf3+**

A possible finish is 70...Bf3+ 71.Kd2 Rxg1! 72.Rxg1 and Kh2 will complete the rout. --- SUMMARY: I think 9...Qxf6 is actually a slightly better line for Black than the more natural 9...Nxf6. It feels to me that the plusses of the move outweigh the minuses.

0-1

### (44)Fernandez Torre, I.   --   Gurevich, M. 26: World Chess Open, Leon  2010   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.d4 c5 6.dxc5 Nc6 7.Bf4 Bxc5 8.Bd3 f6 9.exf6 Qxf6 10.Bg5 Qf7 11.O-O**

White plays it safe and decides against the Russian Roulette 11.Qe2 version (as played in the previous game) , which I think is White's only real try in the position. Having studied these lines, it feels like White gets less than nothing after kingside castling.

**11...O-O 12.Bh4**

QUESTION: Snap question - What does this move threaten? --- ANSWER: The sneaky Bxh7+ picks up a pawn as ...Kxh7 loses to the Ng5+ fork.

**12...h6**

In a previous game, Gurevich tried 12...Qh5 13.Bg3 a6 14.Qe2 Nf6 15.Rad1 Bd7 16.Na4 Ba7 17.c4 when White hopes to destabilize Black's centre. However it isn't for free as he must cough up the bishop pair after 17...Nb4 18.Nc3 Nxd3 19.Qxd3 Rac8 20.cxd5 exd5 21.Nxd5 Qxd5 22.Qxd5+ Nxd5 23.Rxd5 Be6 24.Rd2 Bxa2 . Black stood a shade better in the ending, due to his bishop pair, D.Sengupta-M.Gurevich, Gibraltar 2007.

**13.Qe2 Nf6**

QUESTION: Doesn't this move weaken Black's control over the e5-square? --- ANSWER: Very true. However, the clogging knight can't remain on d7 forever. In this variation, it's important to retain faith that down the line, if we play correctly, we have excellent chances of seizing control over e5 - even if it doesn't appear that way now.

**14.Ne5**

A new move, but I believe it slightly violates a blockading principle.

However, the alternatives also favour Black: 14.Na4 is met by 14...Bd6 15.Bg3 ( 15.c4 is met with 15...Nh5! intending ...Nf4 ) 15...Bxg3 16.hxg3? as in F.Buchenau-T.Heinsohn, Germany 1998. At this point, Black can play 16...e5! and White is busted since if 17.Nxe5?? Nxe5 18.Qxe5 Ng4 19.Qe2 Qh5 wins.

14.Bg3 Nh5! 15.Nh4 Nxg3 16.hxg3 Qf6 17.Ng6 Rd8 18.Qh5 Bd4 gives Black a clear advantage. This is due to his bishop pair, dark-square control, strong pawn centre and domination of the key e5-square, A.Von Wright-T.Vihinen, Finland 2013.

**14...Nxe5 15.Qxe5**

Principle: The queen is the worst blockader, since a challenge by any minor piece forces ejection from the blockade square.

**15...Bd7 16.a3?**

EXERCISE (planning): How can Black seize the initiative?

**16...a6?!**

Gurevich underestimates his own power over the f2-square and makes a quiet strengthening move, in a position where he had so much more.

Watson suggests 16...Nh5 with an edge.

ANSWER: However, stronger is 16...Ng4! when: ( 17.Qc7 Bb6 18.Qd6 ( 18.Qxb7?? Rab8 19.Qa6 Qh5 20.Bg3 Rxf2! wins ) 18...Bc6 19.h3 Nxf2 20.Bxf2 Bxf2+ 21.Kh1 Rad8 22.Qe5 Qe7 leaves White busted, down a pawn and virtually no control over his dark squares. ) ( 17.Qe2? Qh5 wins, since 18.Bg3 is met with the crushing 18...Rxf2! 19.Rxf2 Bxf2+ 20.Kf1 Bxg3 21.h3 Rf8+ 22.Kg1 e5 23.Nxd5 Qh4 24.Rf1 Nf2 25.Ne3 Bxh3 forcing mate. )

**17.Rae1 Rae8 18.Qc7!**

White, seeing the coming build-up on his king, wisely forces queens off the board.

**18...Bc6 19.Qxf7+**

White's queen approaches her famous sister, as a timorous squire would Sir Lancelot, just as he prepares to set out to slay an unlawful dragon, in defence of the realm.

**19...Kxf7**

Black still stands better, due to the potential influence of his pawn centre, but White is infinitely better off here than this same position with queens remaining on the board.

**20.Bg3 g5!**

Intending ...Nh5 and ...Nf4. Also ...h5 and ...h4 may worry White as well.

**21.Nb1!?**

Intending Nd2, Nf3 and Ne5. The trouble is I'm not so sure White has the leisure of four moves to spare.

**21...Nh5 22.Be5 Nf4**

QUESTION: Shouldn't White take this powerful knight?

**23.Nc3?**

The delusional wing-footed knight mistakenly believes he can outrun the opposition and cannot be caught by mere mortals. Agreeing to a waste of two full tempi can't be correct. --- ANSWER: Black's knight is clearly a monster. The frustrating part for White is that he feels he can't afford to take it since his dark-squared bishop is the steward of the critical e5-square.

Black stands a little better at the end of the line 23.Bxf4!? gxf4 24.Nd2 e5 25.c4 dxc4 26.Nxc4 e4 27.b4 exd3 28.bxc5 Rxe1 29.Rxe1 Kf6 30.f3 Rd8 31.Nd6 Ba4 32.Ne4+ Kf5 33.Nd2 Rd5 when White is in some danger in the ending.

QUESTION: Should White have gone ahead to play 23.Nd2 , as he originally intended? --- ANSWER: That is exactly what he should have played. He feared the line 23...Nxd3 . Personally, I would actually avoid this too with White as Black still holds an edge after 24.cxd3 Bb5 25.Rc1 Rc8 . However, now White has a trick to save his d-pawn with 26.Rfd1! and if Black chops with 26...Bxd3? then 27.Rc3! Bc4 28.b3 Kg6 ( 28...Bb5?? drops a piece to the pinning 29.Rdc1 ) 29.bxc4 Rxf2 30.Kh1 Re2 31.Bg3 Ba7 and Black probably doesn't have full compensation for the piece.

**23...Ng6! 24.Bxg6+**

There goes the bishop pair.

Not much choice since Black takes over the initiative after 24.Bg3 Nf4 with the intention of ...e5 next.

**24...Kxg6 25.Rd1 g4?!**

"Exertion should always be in proportion to what is required," wrote Jane Austen in Pride and Prejudice. This seems to be the shaky point in Black's case and the move downgrades the market value of Gurevich's initiative by about 75%. Black's move is intended to stop a future Bd4 and f3. Watson gave this move an exclam. Much as it grieves your writer to contradict the notable chessologist, the move looks premature to me, since it weakens the f4-square and allows White to set up a central dark-square blockade.

I think Black should go with the calmer 25...Rf5! 26.Bd4 Bd6 27.f3 Bc7 with a clear edge, since one day his centre rolls forward.

**26.Bg3?!**

The stronger 26.Ne2! throws a moist blanket, dampening Black's proceedings and energizing White's once flagging blockade. For example: ( 26...Kg5 27.Nd4 h5 28.Rfe1 sets up an iron central blockade. ) ( 26...Rf5 27.Nf4+ Kf7 28.Rfe1 h5 29.Nd3 Ba7 30.c3 Bb5 31.Nf4 h4 32.g3 hxg3 33.hxg3 Bc6 34.Rd2 makes it difficult for Black to shake the blockade and make progress. ) ( 26...Bb5! is Black's best chance. After 27.Nf4+ Rxf4 28.Bxf4 Bxf1 29.Kxf1 Kf5 30.Bd2 h5 31.Ke2 e5 , Black stands better with extra space and more active pieces. Still, White's position is weakness-free and breaking in won't be easy. ( ) )

**26...Kg5!**

Seizing control over h4.

**27.Rfe1 Rf5 28.Ne2!?**

After this move, White gets overrun and the aftermath of his souring position clings to him in unpleasant fashion.

The unpleasant alternative is 28.Re2 h5 29.Rde1 e5! 30.Bxe5 Rexe5 31.Rxe5 Bxf2+ 32.Kf1 Bxe1+ 33.Rxf5+ Kxf5 34.Kxe1 d4 35.Ne2 Bxg2 36.Kf2 Bd5 37.Nxd4+ Ke5! 38.Ke3 h4 when Black retains good winning chances due to the potential of an outside passed pawn, the stronger bishop over the weaker knight and the superior king's position.

**28...e5 29.Nc3?**

EXERCISE (combination alert): White's series of unanswered prayers creates a long list of grievances against the universe. His last move is a blunder which loses material and it feels as if each of his remaining pieces is stranded on its own island. How did Gurevich exploit his advantage?

White's last prayer was 29.Nc1 Bb6 30.h4+ gxh3 31.gxh3 h5 32.h4+ Kh6 with an admittedly wretched game for White, whose position is riddled with weakness and he faces a charging black central pawn-duo.

**29...h5!**

ANSWER: Ignore the threat to the d5-pawn and threaten to smother White's bishop. --- Threat: ...h4. An idea doesn't need to be glamorous; it merely has to work.

**30.Nxd5**

The problem is that 30.h4+ saves the bishop but gets crushed after 30...gxh3 31.gxh3 h4 when attackers convene on the f2-pawn like jackals on a gazelle's carcass. At this point an inventory of White's complaints is pointless; the items are too numerous to mention.

**30...h4**

The g3-bishop is dismayed that an exceedingly unsportsmanlike trick has been played on him by the Almighty. Having committed to martyrdom, he is now deeply disappointed by the fact that he isn't being conveyed to paradise on a canopy of golden light, as he had been led to believe.

**31.Nc3**

The knight's synthetic nonchalance doesn't fool anyone. Why not? For a man who had lost everything, there is nothing else to lose. White continues to scatter largesse, as if in possession of an infinite supply. This blunder, in any case, is already inconsequential at this stage.

White has no chance after 31.Bxh4+ Kxh4 anyway.

**31...hxg3**

. White's king, slowly opening his eyes, inspects the object on g3 with deep revulsion. He hopes to notify his guards by telepathy. Unfortunately, it turns out he isn't psychic and nobody shows up to help him. No one is allowed such close proximity to White's king without the highest security clearance. Yet we see three Black attackers waltz in, planning to conspire further on f2, the eternal weakness which nips and stings White like a raw wound. --- SUMMARY: White seems to slowly lose the initiative with the older, more passive kingside castling plan. I think the Russian Roulette line where White castles queenside is the only path for White.

0-1

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.d4 c5 6.dxc5 Nc6 7.Bf4 Nxc5**

I normally play this slightly offbeat alternative to the more common 7...Bxc5 lines. The pooling of information in chess books, databases, magazines and websites continues to increase the knowledge database to the point where we risk information overload. This is why I tend to favour offshoot paths over main lines, since the latter tend to be the ones our opponents study most. --- QUESTION: Why wouldn't Black want to recapture on c5 with the bishop, which develops a piece? --- ANSWER: Well, in a sense, taking c5 with the knight also develops a piece, since Black must eventually move the d7-knight to untangle his queenside. --- QUESTION: Black seems to get good positions (from my perspective) from the 7...Bxc5 lines, so why switch to some oddball line? --- ANSWER: "Classical" is usually synonymous with "Superior". But what happens when the imitation idea is just as viable as the original? I think Black gets different, but equally promising versions from the ...Nxc5 lines, which tend to lead to slightly more closed positions. So really it's just a matter of taste.

Another variation worth considering is 7...Be7 . --- QUESTION: What is the idea of Black holding back on ...Nxc5? --- ANSWER: Black hopes to sneak in ...g5 with tempo, which may undermine defenders of the e5-pawn. For example, after 8.Be2!? to retain the bishop pair ( 8.Bd3 Nxc5 ) ( and if White wants to prevent ...g5, he can toss in 8.h4 ) 8...a6 9.O-O g5!? . --- QUESTION: Be careful with that axe. Someone could get hurt. Is ...g5 sound? --- ANSWER: As you can see, your moody writer is afflicted with occasional bouts of huffiness. It's debatable whether ...g5 constitutes a plus or a minus for Black. There is no doubt, however, that it increases the complexity level of the position: ( 10.Be3! h5 11.Nd4 Ncxe5 12.b4 with great complications. ) ( 10.Bg3?! h5 11.h3 g4 12.hxg4 hxg4 13.Nd4 ( 13.Nh2 Ndxe5 14.Nxg4 Nxg4 15.Bxg4 Bxc5 gives Black attacking chances, with both h and g-files open though Black's king doesn't look all that safe in the middle ) 13...Bxc5 14.Nxc6 bxc6 15.Bxg4? ( White should cover the g5-square with 15.Qd2 Rh5 16.Rfd1 Qg5! 17.Qxg5 Rxg5 18.Na4 Ba7 19.c4 Nxe5 with insufficient compensation for the pawn for White ) 15...Qg5! 16.Qf3! (the only move, but it cost him close to 20 minutes - suicide for a G/40 time control) 16...Rg8!? 17.Bh5 Qxg3 18.Bxf7+ Ke7!? ( 18...Kf8 19.Bxg8+ Qxf3 20.gxf3 Kxg8 is simpler but I was playing for mate in my opponent's chronic time trouble ) 19.Bxg8 Qxg8 and Black has the edge as he can mobilise the rook on the kingside swiftly, B.Baker-C.Lakdawala, San Diego (rapid) 2013. This game is fully annotated in The Alekhine Defence: Move by Move. )

**8.Bd3**

QUESTION: Isn't White worried about losing the bishop pair? --- ANSWER: I think White should be concerned but the trouble is if White tries to retain bishops,

the alternatives are passive: Watson queries about 8.Qe2!? with the idea of 0-0-0. --- "It's worth a thought, in the spirit of the Zakharov line. White could follow 0-0-0 with Qe3 and Nd4 (Kb1 is also handy), or perhaps h4" (Watson). After 8...Be7 9.h4 a6 10.O-O-O b5 11.Nd4? ( White should have followed Watson's advice with 11.Qe3! when White's position really does look playable, with approximately equal chances ) 11...Nxd4 12.Rxd4 b4! 13.Nb1?! ( it was high time for White to go into emergency mode, and sac an exchange for a pawn with 13.Rxb4 Nd3+ ) 13...Bd7 14.Qg4 g6 15.h5 g5 16.Be3 a5 17.h6 Qc7 and the e5-pawn is loose. The position resembles a game from Chapter One, where however things have gone wrong for White, C.Boschetti-D.Knoedler, Zurich 2000.

I think White would be very lucky to equalise after this passive 8.Be2 . After 8...a6 9.O-O Be7 10.a3 O-O 11.Re1 f5 12.exf6 Bxf6 13.Bg3 Ne4! , Black already stood better, V.Golod-V.Akobian, Philadelphia 2004. If 14.Nxe4 dxe4 15.Nd2 Bxb2 , Black threatens both ...Bxa1 and also ...Bc3. This costs White the exchange with 16.Rb1 Bc3 17.Nxe4 Bxe1 18.Qxe1 e5 and I doubt White has enough compensation.

There is also the waiting move 8.a3 Be7 9.b4 Nd7 10.Nb5 O-O 11.c4!? ( 11.Bd3 a5 12.c3 axb4 13.cxb4 g5! 14.Bg3 g4 15.Nfd4 Ndxe5 and White has insufficient compensation for the pawn ) 11...a5! Principle: Create confrontation when leading in development. White found himself struggling to maintain the integrity of his queenside pawns, L.Aronian-S.Lputian, Yerevan 2001.

**8...Be7 9.h4!?**

In order to avoid ...g5-g4 shenanigans.

9.O-O allows 9...g5 10.Bg3 h5 11.h3 a6 12.Re1 Bd7 13.a3 Qb6 14.b4 Nxd3 15.Qxd3 g4 16.hxg4 hxg4 17.Nh2 Qd4 18.Rad1 Qxd3 19.Rxd3 Rg8 20.Nd1 Na7 21.Ne3 Ba4 22.Nhxg4 Bxc2 23.Rd2 Ba4 24.Nf6+ Bxf6 25.exf6 O-O-O 26.Rc1+ Nc6 and I prefer Black's slightly superior structure to White's dark-square control, J.Barle-G.Dizdar, Slovenia 2011.

**9...Qb6**

Shades of the last chapter.

After 9...a6 10.a3 Bd7 11.h5 h6 12.Rh3 Qb6 13.Rb1 Nxd3+ 14.cxd3 O-O 15.Rg3 Kh7 16.d4 Rg8 17.Qd3+ Kh8 , a natural attacker may favour White here. However, most French players who would probably go for Black due to strength on the light squares, A.Mista-D.Swiercz, Chotowa 2009.

**10.O-O a6**

Now taking the b2-pawn becomes a real threat. --- QUESTION: What about it? Can Black get away with grabbing the b2-pawn?

ANSWER: It has only been tried once. White took the draw after 10...Qxb2 11.Nb5 O-O 12.Rb1 and I don't see anything better than to take the draw with 12...Qxa2 13.Ra1 as played in M.Kivisto-J.Riipinen, Espoo 2008. So the answer to your question is - take b2 if you are okay with an instant draw.

**11.Rb1**

White can't get away with sac'ing the b2-pawn any longer.

**11...Bd7**

Watson declares equality here and for once, I agree with the chessologist. --- QUESTION: I noticed that Black has yet to play ...f6. Is this normal for the ...Nxc5 lines? --- ANSWER: Yes, avoidance of ...f6 makes sense since Black's d7-knight has been diverted from the key e5- and f6- squares. Black does play ...f6 but much later. The philosophy is: White waits for ...f6 when he responds with exf6 and then attempts to blockade the e5-square, as we have seen in the previous games of this chapter. With avoidance of ...f6, Black allows White's cramping e5-pawn to remain on the board, but keeps the position closed in the centre. This generally helps the black side. Meanwhile Black will play both on the queenside and sometimes go for it on the kingside with the ...g5!? thrust, as we have seen in the notes.

**12.a3**

Perhaps contemplating b4.

Watson suggests 12.Be2!? . Maybe now just 12...O-O intending ...f6 looks about even. After 13.b4 Ne4 14.Nxe4 dxe4 15.Nd2 Qc7 16.Nxe4 Nxe5 17.Qd4 f6 , chances are even.

**12...Nxd3**

Theory ends right about here. Black picks up the bishop pair in the hope of favourably opening the game later. His bad bishop is also unopposed on the light squares and may later become a terror for White.

Black can also opt to complete kingside development with 12...O-O 13.b4 Nxd3 14.Qxd3 Rac8 15.Ne2 and here Black believes the time is ripe to challenge e5 with 15...f6 , since now he owns the bishop pair. The game continued 16.exf6 Bxf6 17.c4 Be8 (threat: ...Bg6) M.Popov-S.Iskusnyh, Khanty-Mansiysk 2011. Now White should play 18.c5 Qd8 19.Qe3 d4! 20.Qxe6+ Bf7 21.Qf5 Bg6 22.Qe6+ Bf7 with a draw by repetition of moves.

**13.cxd3**

On 13.Qxd3 , I recommend that Black should cover both Ng5 and Bg5 tricks with 13...h6 before castling.

**13...O-O**

I already prefer Black's position.

**14.b4**

On 14.Be3 , I would sac a pawn to clear the light squares with 14...d4!? 15.Nxd4 Nxd4 16.Qg4 f5! 17.Bxd4 ( 17.Qxd4 Qxd4 18.Bxd4 Bxh4 and Black regains the lost pawn with at least equality ) 17...fxg4 18.Bxb6 Bxh4 19.Ne4 Rf5 20.Bd4 Be7 . Black's bishop pair and light-square control are counterbalanced by White's superiority on the dark squares.

**14...Nd4!**

Principle: Swaps benefit the cramped side.

**15.Nxd4 Qxd4 16.Ne2 Qb6**

Now Black's bishops gain activity.

**17.h5**

One senses that the h5-conscript is an unwilling participant in a war he doesn't believe in.

**17...f6**

Finally, Black engages the natural central counter.

**18.Be3**

18.h6 g6 19.Be3 Qd8 20.exf6 Bxf6 21.Qd2 Rf7 gives dynamically equal chances. Black must be careful not to push his central pawns too early and allow a blockade.

**18...Qc7**

Interesting is 18...Qc6!? with the idea of 19.Rc1 Qa4 .

**19.exf6 Bxf6 20.Rc1 Qd8 21.Bc5**

21.h6 g6 weakens the black king's cover but White's pawn might drop off in the ending. Still I think White should toss in the move, mainly because White is just as likely to drop the pawn on h5 as well.

**21...Rf7 22.f4!?**

Radically discouraging ...e5. White still hopes for a future e5/d4 dark-square blockade.

**22...Qe8 23.Qd2 e5!?**

Principle: Open the position when you have the bishop pair. Suddenly, a once drab and grey position explodes with multi-coloured potential.

**24.Rce1!?**

White should perhaps consider sac'ing a pawn for initiative with 24.fxe5! Qxe5 25.Bd4 Qxh5 26.Bxf6 Rxf6 27.Rxf6 gxf6 28.Nf4 . White generates full compensation for the pawn as evidenced by the powerful knight and potential danger to Black's semi-exposed king.

**24...e4 25.Nc3?!**

White should play 25.dxe4! dxe4 26.Ng3 Bc6 27.Qc2 Rd7! ( 27...Bh4?! 28.Nxe4! Bxe1 29.Ng5! and the exchange is favourably regained with this double attack ) 28.h6 Qg6 29.Nxe4 Kh8 30.Rf3 Qxh6 31.Nxf6 gxf6 32.Rh3 Qg7 33.Rh2 Rad8 . Both kings experience some danger. I suspect the opposite-coloured bishops slightly favour Black here. They are twins separated at birth, who now speak different languages, each a total mystery to the other with no hope of meaningful communication.

**25...Bxc3! 26.Qxc3 Bb5! 27.Rf3!?**

This trick provides dramatic mood music to White's ambitions. He offers a pair of rooks for a queen.

White can also try handing over the exchange with 27.dxe4 Bxf1 28.exd5 Qd7 29.Rxf1 Qxd5 30.h6 Rd8 31.hxg7 Rxg7 32.Rf3 . I suspect Black's extra exchange is worth more than White's pawn since Black's king doesn't look any more exposed than White's.

**27...exf3 28.Rxe8+**

Now that one of them is dead, all that connects the two queens is memory.

**28...Rxe8 29.g3?!**

Houdini says this is okay but I don't like it and would rather eliminate Black's f-pawn with 29.Bd6! fxg2 30.Kxg2 Bc6 31.d4 Rf5 32.Qf3 h6 33.Kg3 Re1 34.Be5 when I don't think a win for Black will be easy to achieve.

**29...Re2 30.Bd6?**

EXERCISE (planning): White's last move is a blunder, pushing his position past tolerable limits, the way an emboldened customer in a deli asks to have his bagel with gorgonzola, rather than cream cheese. The move allows Black a winning attack. How does Black set it up?

White resists best with 30.Bf2! h6 31.d4 Rfe7 32.g4 Ra2 33.Qxf3 Ree2 34.Qxd5+ Kh8 35.Qf5 Rxf2 36.Qf8+ Kh7 37.Qf5+ . The queen's spasmodic flailings inflict no damage and are for show only, since there is no perpetual check. Following 37...Kg8 38.Qe6+ Kf8 39.Qd6+ Ke8 40.Qe6+ Kd8 41.Qd6+ Bd7 42.Qb8+ Ke7 43.Qe5+ Be6 44.Qc7+ Ke8 45.Qb8+ Kf7 46.Qxb7+ Kf6 47.Qa8 Rg2+ 48.Kh1 Rh2+ 49.Kg1 Rag2+ 50.Qxg2 ( 50.Kf1 Bc4+ 51.Ke1 Rg1# is mate! ) 50...Rxg2+ 51.Kxg2 Bxg4 , Black wins.

**30...Bd7!**

ANSWER: Transfer the bishop into the attack via d7 and h3. The emotionally isolated bishop keeps his innermost secret - murderous compulsions, hidden from those around him until now. --- This deadly transfer halts White in midstride. Black threatens ...f2+, followed by ...Bh3, forcing promotion of the f-pawn.

**31.Bc5 Rg2+ 32.Kf1**

32.Kh1 Rf5! threatening mate on h5, is a game-ender.

**32...Bh3**

Arguing with the bishop is a futile exercise and ignoring him doesn't work either. Not all walls are capable of excluding the unpleasant and unwanted from our lives.

**33.Bf2**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Even the comforting presence of the queen nearby, fails to soothe the white king's security concerns. In reality, the queen's defensive power is meaningless and she remains marginalized, jammed into the footnotes of the position. Black's attack reached its apex. Now comes the time to look for the finish.

After 33.Ke1 , Black has the 33...Re7+! deflection. Following 34.Bxe7 ( 34.Kd1 f2 35.Bxf2 Rxf2 is completely hopeless as well, for White ) 34...f2+ 35.Ke2 Bg4+ , White's king has no way of stepping off the merry-go-round and he remains caught in his circular nightmare with 36.Kf1 Rh2! and the coming ...Bh3+ is devastating.

**33...Re7!**

. ANSWER: Principle: In a king hunt, don't chase the king. Instead, cut off escape routes. White has no way to deal with the coming discovered attack by the g2 rook, since defending against that opens fresh discoveries. --- Much stronger than taking g3 with check. White's only choices now: Which hell would he prefer to be broiled in?

33...Re7 34.Bd4 runs into the 34...Rd2+! discovery/interference, and 35.Kg1 gets the king ambushed as his mouth forms into a perfect "O", bearing witness to his utter shock at 35...Re1# mate! "The king rests comfortably," says the rook. And by that, he means in the coffin. --- SUMMARY: I tend to favour the ...Nxc5 versions over ...Bxc5 main lines. White tends to be less well-prepared theoretically against this offshoot.

0-1

### (46)Chan, D.   --   Ding, L. 28: Asian Nations Ch (Team), Zaozhuang  2012   0-1   C11 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.d4 c5 6.dxc5 Nc6 7.Bf4 Nxc5 8.Bd3 Be7 9.h4**

Once again, White is careful not to allow ...g5 tricks.

**9...f5**

An interesting new idea. --- QUESTION: What is the difference between this move and playing ...f6? --- ANSWER: By playing ...f5, White is given a choice: Take en passant, leading to the standard fight for the e5-square, or retain the choking e5-pawn.

**10.Qe2**

QUESTION: White decided not to take en passant. What benefit does Black get from the deal? --- ANSWER: Black gets use of the e4-square, similar to a Stonewall Dutch and his c5-knight is conveniently located to enter the square.

QUESTION: How should Black proceed after 10.exf6 ? --- ANSWER: Something like this: 10...Bxf6 and White lunges ahead with 11.Ng5 , M Fierro Baquero-C.Le Bail, Guingamp 2006. Now Black can play ( 11.Bg3 O-O , I prefer Black as White's h4 does more harm than good ) 11...Bxc3+ 12.bxc3 Qf6 with a double attack. Following 13.Bd6 Qxc3+ 14.Kf1 Nxd3 15.cxd3 Qf6 16.Nf3 e5 17.Bxe5 Nxe5 18.Qe2 O-O 19.Qxe5 Bf5 , Black has the advantage since it takes quite a while for the h1-rook to emerge. Meanwhile, Black threatens the d3-bishop and may soon initiate a rook infiltration down the c-file.

**10...Ne4**

This knight is in White's face and it won't be all that easy to engineer an f3 ejection.

**11.Ng5?!**

White's war hasn't been flooded with volunteers signing on the dotted line. So he decides he can't afford to be choosy and must allow any riffraff into his army. Chan is seized with a bout of the disease which intermittently afflicts natural attackers: An overtly optimistic assessment of the attacking potential in his position. So he defies the dictates of cautious judgment and takes a dubious plunge. Black stands better after this move.

White should instead go for a d4-blockade plan with 11.Nb5 a6 12.Nbd4 when 12...Qa5+! disrupts queenside castling plans that White may have entertained. Following 13.Kf1 h6 14.c3 , dynamic equality ensues.

**11...Qb6**

Black can actually get away with castling into the attack with 11...O-O!? and if 12.Qh5 h6 13.Nf3 Qb6 14.O-O Bc5 15.Bxh6 Bxf2+ 16.Kh2 Nxe5! 17.Bxe4 Ng4+ 18.Kh1 Nxh6 19.Nxd5 exd5 20.Bxd5+ Kh8 21.Ne5 Kh7! , Black should be able to withstand the attack, consolidate and win.

**12.O-O O-O**

Immediately grabbing the b2-pawn is risky but still very playable.

After 12...Qxb2!? 13.Nb5 Nc3 14.Nxc3 Qxc3 15.Qh5+ g6 16.Qf3 Bxg5 ( 16...Nxe5?? hangs the queen to 17.Bb5+ ) ( 16...O-O 17.Qg3 (with dangerous attacking chances for the pawn) ) 17.Bxg5 O-O 18.h5 Qxe5 19.Rfe1 Qg7 20.hxg6 hxg6 , White's powerful dark-square control, developmental lead and potential to attack offer practical chances for the two pawns.

**13.Rab1 h6 14.Nf3**

The knight steps aside with a grudgingly irritable grunt, proving that the g5 excursion was a waste of time.

**14...a6 15.g3**

It feels like White ran out of useful ideas. --- QUESTION: I noticed that White keeps allowing ...Nxc3 and Black avoids it. Why? --- ANSWER: The wary knights eye one another, the way my dogs act when they see another dog on a walk. Black threatens ...Nxc3 at various stages to damage White's structure and also increases his activity. Also, it allows White central disruptions with c4, which Black would like to avoid. I would just ignore temptation the way Ding played it.

**15...Bd7 16.Bxe4?**

This does little to alleviate the foreboding feeling hanging over White's game. White stood worse but this move makes it worse. In the space of a single ply, White gives away the bishop pair, weakens his light squares, allows Black a pawn wedge on e4 and opens the f-file for Black's rooks.

I would play the admittedly depressing 16.Qd1 intending Ne2 and await Black's intention.

**16...fxe4 17.Nh2**

EXERCISE (planning): White isn't going to have time for some leisurely Qh5 and Ng4 attacking build-up. How can Black win material here? --- ANSWER: The e5-pawn is untenable.

**17...Rf5! 18.Kh1 Nxe5 19.Bxe5**

There goes the other bishop.

**19...Rxe5 20.f3**

This move hopes to regain the pawn, at the cost of turning his light squares into sashimi.

**20...Bc6 21.fxe4 dxe4 22.Ng4 Rf5 23.Ne3**

The passed e-pawn, just itching to move forward, is thwarted and experiences emotions similar to the Chinese tank driver during the Tiananmen Square uprising.

Instead, 23.Nxe4?? drops material after 23...Raf8! as now the e4-knight is hanging and Black can't swap on f5. Thus, 24.Kg2 h5! 25.Nf2 Rxf2+ 26.Rxf2 Rxf2+ 27.Qxf2 Bxe4+ wins for Black.

**23...Rxf1+ 24.Rxf1 Rf8 25.Rxf8+ Bxf8 26.Ncd1**

White's position worsens with each passing move. Black is up a pawn with two bishops versus two knights in an open position, which is tantamount to a winning position.

**26...Qc7 27.Kh2 Qe5**

Intending ...Bd6.

**28.Ng4 Qf5**

More accurate is 28...Qd4 29.Nge3 Bd6 30.Kg2 Qe5 31.Qf2 b5 .

**29.Nde3 Qc5 30.b3 h5**

Although this move creates a hole, Black feels he can afford that luxury.

**31.Nf2 g6 32.Qd2 Bh6 33.Nfd1 Kh7 34.Qf2 Qf8 35.Qd2**

This endangers White's king but the ending after the queen swap looks hopeless.

**35...Qf3 36.Qd4 Qe2+ 37.Kh1 Qf3+ 38.Kh2**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Black to play and force the win of material. --- ANSWER: Overloaded defender/deflection.

**38...Bxe3! 39.Nxe3 Qf2+**

Black's queen has great affection for her brother, which unfortunately goes unreturned.

**40.Kh3**

The king's peace of mind is in direct proportion to the distance he maintains with Black's obnoxious queen. So he ensconces himself into h3, hoping to make himself a less visible target.

Also hopeless is 40.Kh1 Qxg3 and the king chafes in impotent rage as his defenders have let him down.

**40...e5!**

A good general always secretes a plan within a plan. Trilateral negotiations commence between queen, bishop and e-pawn over the best method of tormenting White's queen. This shot, which pokes and prods with acupuncture needles, overburdens White's queen who can't watch over the e3-knight and the powerful bishop check on d7 simultaneously.

**41.Qd6**

Also futile is 41.Qc5 as an event isn't necessarily cancelled if one party refuses to participate. After 41...Bd7+ , the bishop declares, "Virtue is its own reward" as he twists the knife deeper into the king's ribs. Following 42.g4 hxg4+ 43.Nxg4 Bxg4+ 44.Kxg4 , the dazed king sees spots float and dance before his eyes as 44...Qg2# ends the contest. It turns out that g4 isn't the tranquil oasis White's king imagined it to be.

**41...Qxe3**

. There is no perpetual check.

A possible finish is 41...Qxe3 42.Qe7+ Kg8 43.Qe6+ Kf8 44.Qf6+ when the queen refuses to abandon Black's king, the way Lassie, when ordered home by Timmy, would disobey and continue to trail her master surreptitiously, crouching behind barns to achieve her goal. Following 44...Ke8 45.Qxe5+ Kd7 46.Qg7+ Kc8 47.Qh8+ Kc7 48.Qe5+ Kb6 , White runs out of checks and must give up the ghost. --- SUMMARY: I like 9...f5, which is sure to surprise your opponent and burden him or her with original problems to solve over the board.

### (47)5: Burn Variation   --   ? ? ????   \* (Cyrus Lakdawala)

We enter the

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5**

lines of the book, covering the dynamic

**4...dxe4 5.Nxe4 Be7 6.Bxf6 gxf6**

lines of the Burn Variation. This is our major alternative to the McCutcheon which we will cover in the next two chapters. Our structure is similar to lines of the Scandinavian and ...gxf6 Caro-Kann. The difference is that in the Burn, we pick up the bishop pair. Our 6...gxf6 recapture isn't merely an irrational leap of faith. It can be argued that Black's structure may be superior to the intact kingside pawn structure with the g-pawn still on g7. 6...gxf6 opens the g-file for our rooks and can lead to devastating attacks, like in Polgar-Morozevich (Game 36). Also our f6-pawn covers the key e5-square and if we later choose to play ...f5, then we take control over the e4-square from the white knight. If we manage to catch up in development and play ...c5 and ...cxd4, we decimate White's pawn centre. In this line, White essentially hands over several strategic concessions for a developmental lead. --- Now you may ask: Why toss in ...a6? Now Morozevich has honed this idea into a deadly weapon. Black plans the ambitious ...b5 (rather than a conservative ...b6) with ...Bb7 to follow. Not only does this turn our traditionally bad light-squared bishop into one of the most powerful pieces on the board, it also discourages White from castling queenside since he or she then walks head-on into our pawn storm. Our line is risky but the rewards are great. A good general understands to achieve victory, he or she must sometimes place troops in harm's way to provoke the enemy. Often, White misjudges our 6...gxf6 recapture, fails the equanimity test and decides to go ballistic. Take a look at the games in this chapter and you will see, our position is not one which can be knocked over easily, and our counterattack often arrives with withering force.

### (48)Humphrey, J.   --   Lakdawala, C. 29: Gambito Open (rapid), San Diego  2013   0-1   C13 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6**

3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 is the Rubinstein French.

**4.Bg5**

This move represents a demarcation point in the book.

Previously, we only looked at 4.e5 lines.

**4...dxe4**

The starting position of the Burn Variation, which has similarities to the Rubinstein French, but I believe the former is a superior version of it. --- QUESTION: Why is it superior to the Rubinstein French? --- ANSWER: The inclusion of Bg5 and ...Nf6 favours Black, because swaps are more likely in the Burn, rather than the Rubinstein. --- QUESTION: Why do swaps help our side? --- ANSWER: Principle: The cramped side benefits from piece trades.

**5.Nxe4 Be7**

Black's most logical move. White must either lose a tempo or agree to a trade.

5...Nbd7 , which we don't cover in the book, is also played here.

**6.Nxf6+**

White cedes any hope of an opening edge and desires to simplify to a drawish position.

Let's look at some less critical lines: 6.Ng3 c5 and here, we have the following possibilities: ( 7.dxc5 Qa5+ 8.Qd2 Qxc5 9.Nf3 Nbd7 10.O-O-O b6 11.Be3 Qd5 12.Qxd5 Nxd5 13.Bd4 O-O and the position resembles a ...Nd7 Caro-Kann where Black has achieved equality, P.Gesos-E.Van den Doel, Aghios Kirykos 2000. ) ( 7.Nf3 is met by 7...Qb6 (with an attack of b2) which is awkward for White. Following 8.Bd3 cxd4 9.Nxd4 h6 10.Be3 Nd5 , I think Black already stands better. 11.O-O ( 11.Bc1 is met with 11...Bb4+! and if 12.c3? , Black has 12...Nxc3! 13.bxc3 Bxc3+ 14.Bd2 Bxd4 when White's developmental lead isn't nearly worth two pawns ) 11...Nxe3 12.fxe3 Nd7 13.Qg4 was J.Lehti-J.Tella, Finland 2005. Now Black can play 13...Bg5 14.Rae1 Nf6 15.Qf3 O-O when White's attacking chances do not make up for his structural woes. )

6.Bd3?! is a dubious pawn sac after 6...Nxe4 7.Bxe7 Qxe7 8.Bxe4 Qb4+ . This double attack trick picks off the b2-pawn. After 9.c3 Qxb2 10.Ne2 Qa3 , I don't believe in White's compensation for the pawn since Black's position remains weakness-free, E.Callet-A.Barsov, Massy 1995.

For the rest of the chapter, we will cover 6.Bxf6 , which is White's only chance at an advantage.

**6...Bxf6 7.Bxf6**

White hopes to swap down to a drawish position.

**7...Qxf6 8.Nf3 O-O 9.Bd3**

White has tried 9.c3 to discourage the immediate ...c5 which would now become a pawn sacrifice. After 9...Nd7 10.Be2 b6 11.Qa4 a6 12.O-O ( after 12.Qc6 , Black eventually unravels after 12...Ra7 13.O-O Qe7 14.Bd3 Nf6 15.Ne5 Bb7 16.Qa4 Raa8 17.Rfe1 Rfd8 18.Rad1 c5 (at long last!) 19.dxc5 Qxc5 20.Qf4 b5 and Black equalizes ) 12...Qe7 13.Nd2 Bb7 14.Bf3 Bxf3 15.Nxf3 c5 16.Rad1 b5 17.Qa5 Rfc8 18.Rfe1 cxd4 19.Rxd4 Nc5 , Black has created an imbalance with the opposite wing pawn majorities in this equal position, H.Stefansson-N.Short, Reykjavik 2002.

**9...c5**

Playing on the fact that the b2-pawn is loose. This move at least creates opposite wing pawn majorities, in the hopes of sharpening the game and foiling White's intention to make the game as dull as possible.

**10.O-O**

Bolstering up the centre with 10.c3 cxd4 11.Nxd4 ( 11.cxd4 looks like a lacklustre isolani position from White's side. The fact that two pairs of pieces have been swapped away favours Black ) 11...e5 allows Black to achieve a favourable c3-Sicilian type of position. After 12.Ne2 Nd7 13.Qc2 g6 14.Ng3 Nc5 15.Bc4 Qf4! 16.Bd5 Rd8 17.Rd1 Bg4 18.Rd2 Be6 19.Bxe6 Nxe6 , White found himself seriously behind in development and has the inferior pawn majority. Now, after 20.Re2? . --- EXERCISE (combination alert): Black to play and win. --- ANSWER: Fork/line opening. 20...Nd4! 21.cxd4 Rac8 and Black emerges with a decisive material gain, since both the queen and ...Rc1+ are threatened, I.Vitic-G.Dizdar, Pula 1997.

**10...cxd4 11.Nxd4 Rd8**

Of course not 11...Qxd4?? as 12.Bxh7+ wins. Any chess player, who claims he or she has never fallen for this trap at least once, is a liar!

**12.Nb5!**

I was counting on 12.c3? which favours Black after 12...e5 13.Nb5 e4! 14.Nc7 exd3 15.Nxa8 Na6 16.Re1 h6 17.Qb3 Be6! 18.Qxb7 d2 19.Red1 Bd5 20.Qb5 Qg6 21.Qf1 Bxa8 . White is busted, since the d2-passer paralyzes him.

**12...Na6**

A new move. --- QUESTION: Why place your knight offside? --- ANSWER: Only temporarily offside. Black intends either ...Nc5 or ...Nb4 and then chop on d3. This creates further imbalance to the position, which should favour Black.

The more popular 12...Nc6 can follow 13.Qc1 a6 14.Nc3 b5 15.Ne4 Qe7 16.a3 Ne5 17.Be2 Bb7 18.Qe3 Rac8 19.c3 Nc4 20.Bxc4 , I.Kapic-T.Luther, Boeblingen 2003. I would probably recapture with the pawn to apply pressure to the now backward b2-pawn with 20...bxc4 21.Rad1 Ba8 , hence preparing...Qb7. I prefer Black here.

**13.Nc3?!**

Sometimes excessive caution can bring as much regret as an impulsive action. --- EXERCISE (combination alert): Not all combinations are played against the opponent. Sometimes we play a move to avoid falling into one ourselves. Black can play 13...Nc5 and also 13...Nb4. Only one of the moves is correct. Which one?

He shouldn't allow structural damage: 13.Qc1 is somewhat passive and allows Black to take over the initiative after 13...Nc5 14.Be2 Bd7 15.c3 Qg6 16.Qe3 Bc6 17.f3 Nd3! 18.Nxa7 Nxb2 19.Nxc6 bxc6 20.Rab1 Qc2 21.Rfc1 Qd2 22.Qe4 Na4 23.Rc2 Qd5 24.Qxd5 cxd5 . Black stands a bit better due to the superior structure.

During the game I saw 13.Qg4! : ( . I was considering meeting it with the calm 13...Bd7 14.Nc3 Bc6 15.Bxa6 Rd4 16.Qe2 bxa6 17.Rad1 ( 17.Qxa6?? is met with the crushing 17...Bxg2! ) 17...Rb4 18.Rd6 Bb7 19.Rb1 and Black's open files compensate for the damage to his queenside structure. ) ( 13...Nc5 14.Bxh7+! Kxh7 15.Qh5+ Kg8 16.Qxc5 and Houdini claims Black gets full compensation here but I'm not so sure about this assessment. ) ( 13...Qxb2 !? is met with the double attack 14.Qh4! Qf6 15.Qxh7+ Kf8 and I suspect White's activity and attacking chances slightly outweigh Black's superior structure. )

**13...Nb4!**

ANSWER!

Not 13...Nc5? The unwilling knight is pushed out on the stage, without makeup or rehearsal, and is unsure of his lines. This move appears to accomplish the same thing but fails, since it allows 14.Bxh7+! which ruins it all after 14...Kxh7 15.Qh5+ Kg8 16.Qxc5 with an extra pawn for White. It's as if Santa wants dearly to rain down gifts to the virtuous children of the world but is forced to renege on past promises because his elves went on strike for higher wages, 100% healthcare coverage, longer vacations and better working conditions.

**14.Qe2 Nxd3 15.cxd3 Bd7 16.Qe3 Bc6**

Advantage Black, who has a pawn target (the d3-isolani), control over the d4-square and the superior minor piece.

**17.Rad1 Qd4**

My queen insinuates herself into the argument, declaring, "As your sovereign, it is my right to meddle in the affairs of my subjects." I felt the isolani would be better exploited if queens were removed from the board.

**18.Rd2 Rd7 19.Rfd1 Rad8 20.Qxd4 Rxd4 21.f3 f6 22.Kf2 Kf7 23.b3**

White can't make defensive progress and simply awaits Black's intent. --- QUESTION: Often, one weakness isn't enough to win the game, since in this case, White can easily defend d3 as many times as it can be attacked. How can you make progress? --- ANSWER: My plan was to increase kingside space and probe in that region for a second weakness.

**23...g5 24.Ne2 R4d7 25.Nc3 b6 26.Ke3 Rc7 27.Rc1 Bb7 28.Ne2 Rcd7 29.Rc4 e5 30.Rc3 f5 31.Nc1**

White trots all his prize poodles on the dog show floor but just can't make them jump or run. Nimzowitsch would have approved of this move. Now that's what I call overprotection of the d3-pawn!

**31...h5 32.g3?!**

This unsolicited and unhelpful ally creates another weakness on f3 and makes it easier for Black to create a passed pawn.

White was better off awaiting the black kingside pawns' arrival in deferential manner with 32.Rdc2 .

**32...Kf6 33.Rdc2**

EXERCISE (planning): White hoped to convert his kingside into a bunker of sorts. Apparently it hasn't been sufficiently converted. Find a way for Black to make progress. --- ANSWER: Creation of a passed pawn. --- Step 1: Fix f3 as a stationary target.

**33...f4+**

This move drives a wedge into White's defensive barrier.

**34.Ke2 g4**

Step 2: Force the creation of a passed f-pawn.

**35.fxg4 hxg4**

White is strategically busted. The weakness of the fixed h2 and g3-pawn duo as a potential target is compounded by future threats like ...Rh8, ...fxg3, followed by the ...Rh2+ or ...Rh1 infiltration.

**36.Rc7 Ke6?!**

The king, who has little patience for any opinions which contradicts his own, walks about with a sense of barely suppressed grievance at the c7 intrusion.

Black has a forcing line which wins a pawn with 36...Bf3+! 37.Ke1 Rxc7 38.Rxc7 Rh8 39.Rc2 fxg3 40.hxg3 Rh1+ 41.Kd2 Rh2+ 42.Kc3 Rh3 . Each one of the rook's visits is a fresh suffering for White. After 43.Ne2 Bxe2 44.Rxe2 Rxg3 45.Kd2 Rf3 , Black wins this one comfortably since White's king is unable to help halt the passed g-pawn.

**37.Rxd7 Rxd7 38.Kf2 Rh7!**

Targets: the h2- and g3-pawns.

**39.Ke1 Bf3**

Of course, the bishop's outward show of affability is a mere affectation, generated to hide his true personality. Meanwhile, White's king, feeling uneasy, seeks to verify the suspicion that traitors hide within his inner circle.

**40.gxf4**

This appears to help Black but the trouble is passively waiting with 40.Rf2 Kd5 41.Kd2 fxg3 42.hxg3 Rh3 43.Ne2 Bxe2 44.Rxe2 Rxg3 . This revisits a line similar to the one we examined in the above note to Black's 36th move.

**40...exf4 41.Ne2 Ke5**

Endgame principle: The king is a fighting piece. Use it.

**42.Ng1**

To a canary in a cage, the entire universe is merely the size of the room.

**42...Bd5 43.Re2+ Kd4 44.Kd2 a5 45.Rf2 f3**

. Zugzwang. White's rook and knight are a happy couple who almost never quarrel, except they endure a constant, running argument with each other in their minds. The defenders feel as if they are suspended in mid-air or slow-motion, like a fight scene from The Matrix. White is only left with pawn moves.

With 45...f3 46.h3 , the h-pawn understands the difference between a request and a command. White's knight secures his release from custody at an exorbitantly high bail. If 46...gxh3 47.Rh2 and here, I had planned to simplify with the deflecting 47...f2 . White's rook can't vacate its h2-blockade but yet, it must. Following, 48.Ne2+ , the long atrophied knight's dream of jumping out of her wheelchair and dancing the can-can comes true. The game might finish with 48...Kc5 49.Rxf2 h2 50.Ng3 h1=Q 51.Nxh1 Rxh1 and Black nets an extra piece for an easy win. --- SUMMARY: When White swaps twice on f6 in the opening, it doesn't guarantee him or her an easy draw.

0-1

### (49)Akash, G.   --   Caruana, F. 30: FIDE World Cup, Tromso  2013   0-1   C13 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6**

Compare the position after 6...gxf6 and those that Black gets from the following lines of the Scandinavian ( 1...d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nc3 Qa5 4.d4 Nf6 5.Nf3 c6 6.Bd2 Bf5 7.Bc4 e6 8.Nd5 Qd8 9.Nxf6+ gxf6 )<skip start="6...gxf6"/>

and the ...gxf6 Caro-Kann ( 1...c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nf6 5.Nxf6+ gxf6 ). In both cases, I prefer the Burn French version since Black gets the bonus of the bishop pair, which is missing from the Scandinavian and Caro-Kann lines.

**2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 dxe4 5.Nxe4 Be7 6.Bxf6**

White's only real shot at an edge. --- QUESTION: Why? He just handed Black the bishop pair. --- ANSWER: It's either this or to accept the dullness of White's setup in the previous game. This is the only way White can retain his powerful e4-knight. Of course, as you pointed out, there is risk involved since he hands Black the bishop pair.

**6...gxf6**

The most dynamic and ambitious line, which we cover exclusively in the book. --- QUESTION: Why would Black voluntarily damage his pawn structure? --- ANSWER: I would label it changed, rather than damaged. After all, by playing 6...gxf6, Black opens the g-file for his rook and also takes control over the e5-square. If Black should later play ...f5, then we control the key e4-square as well. A pretty good bargain, in my opinion, for the small price of weakening the structure by creating another pawn island.

QUESTION: What is wrong with 6...Bxf6 ? --- ANSWER: Nothing really but the position is a bit dull and I'm not really so confident that Black has equalized. I think we should jump at the chance of creating an imbalance with the more dynamic ...gxf6 recapture. Here is an example: 7.Nf3 O-O 8.c3 b6 9.Bd3 Bb7 10.Qc2 h6?! , C.Lakdawala-K.Griffith, San Diego (rapid) 2010. White can now claim an edge after ( instead 10...Nd7 looks correct here ) 11.Nxf6+ Qxf6 12.Bh7+ Kh8 13.Be4 Bxe4 14.Qxe4 Nd7 15.Qc6 Qd8 16.O-O .

**7.Nf3**

QUESTION: What if White plays the immediate 7.g3 to prevent Black's coming ...a6, ...b5 plan? --- ANSWER: Black takes over the initiative after 7...f5 8.Nc3 Bf6 9.Nge2 ( 9.Nf3 Nc6 10.Ne2 b6 and Black's bishop makes it to the diagonal after all with at least equality, since White wasted time with his e2-knight ) 9...Nc6 10.d5 exd5 11.Bg2 d4 12.Nd5 Be5 13.O-O Be6 14.Nef4 Qd6 15.Re1 O-O-O . Black is well-developed, his d4-pawn has a cramping effect and I don't believe in White's full compensation for the pawn, W.Kobese-N.Short, Khanty-Mansiysk 2010.

**7...f5**

We mainly cover the move order 7...a6 and then follow up with ...f5 subsequently. --- QUESTION: What are the differences between an earlier ...f5 followed by ...a6 or vice-versa? --- ANSWER: 1. When Black plays the immediate 7...f5, we pretty much force White's knight to c3, thereby cutting down our opponent's options. However, one may argue that c3 is a good outpost for the knight, since it helps prepare the thematic d5 break. --- 2. When Black plays 7...a6, we keep White guessing if and when we are going to toss in ...f5. Both have their merits and it's just a matter of taste which one you prefer. My personal preference is for 7...a6.

We won't have room to cover the more solid and less ambitious 7...b6 .

**8.Nc3**

The best square for the knight, since White worries us with d5 line-opening ideas 8.Ng3 c5 9.Bb5+ Bd7 10.Bxd7+ Qxd7 11.d5 exd5 12.Ne5 Qe6 13.f4 Nd7 14.O-O O-O-O 15.Qh5 Nxe5 16.fxe5 Qxe5 17.Rae1 Qd4+ 18.Kh1 Qh4 19.Rxf5 Qxh5 20.Nxh5 Rd7 21.Rxf7 Bd8 was V.Gashimov-M.Carlsen, Monte Carlo (rapid) 2011. Black stands at least equal and possibly slightly better in the ending, since he has bishop versus knight with opposite wing pawn majorities.

8.Ned2 c5 9.Bb5+ Bd7 as played in R.Felgaer-E.Najer Jerusalem 2005, looks good for Black after 10.Bxd7+ Nxd7 11.O-O cxd4 12.Nxd4 Qb6 due to the strong dark-squared bishop and superior central influence.

**8...a6**

Black's most popular move here. Black plans ...b5, ...Bb7 and ...c5, exploiting his bishop pair and gaining space on the queenside, which incidentally, discourages White from castling there.

We won't cover Black's main alternative 8...Bf6 when White usually follows with 9.Qd2 c5 10.d5 .

**9.g3**

Considered by most to be White's most solid setup, challenging Black's coming ...b5 and ...Bb7.

We look at 9.Qd2 later on in the chapter.

**9...b5**

Black's main idea in the position. He seizes space and contests White's coming fianchetto on the h1-a8 diagonal.

**10.Bg2 Bb7 11.O-O**

An aggressive try is 11.Qe2 , intending 0-0-0 and d5. Black should meet this vigorously with 11...b4 12.Na4 Qd5! 13.Nh4 Qb5 14.c4 ( worse is 14.Qxb5+?! axb5 15.Bxb7 Rxa4 when the problem for White is that Black threatens both ...c6 and also ...Bxh4. After 16.Bf3 Bxh4 17.gxh4 Ke7 , Black clearly has the better ending with the superior structure, Also, White is tied down to the defence of the a2-pawn ) 14...bxc3 15.Nxc3 Qxe2+ 16.Kxe2 Nc6 17.d5 Nd4+ 18.Kd3 Bf6 19.Rad1 Rb8 and Black stands a shade better in this sharp ending, due to his bishop pair plus the safer king, G.Rohit-Wang Hao, Cebu 2007.

**11...c5**

Black immediately challenges White's central superiority. --- QUESTION: It seems to me like Black may be violating the principle: Don't allow the position to open when lagging in development. Does Black have to play the immediate 11...c5?

ANSWER: No. Black can also delay it for a move with 11...O-O . Castling kingside may surprise some readers. Black's king is a lot safer than it looks. This variation was tested against the world's best player after 12.Re1 c5 : ( . Carlsen speculates with a shady-looking pawn sac with 13.d5!? . After 13...b4 14.Ne2 Bxd5 15.Nf4 Be4 16.Qc1!? , the game was agreed drawn in M.Carlsen-N.Sedlak, Khanty-Mansiysk 2010, although I don't believe in White's alleged compensation after 16...Nc6. ( Instead, 16.Ne5 Qxd1 17.Raxd1 Bxg2 18.Kxg2 Rc8 19.Nc4 Rc7 20.Na5 won't be easy for Black to convert. ) ) ( . Perhaps Carlsen should settle for 13.dxc5 Bxc5 14.Ne5 Bxg2 15.Kxg2 Qc7 16.Qf3 Nd7 17.Nxd7 Qxd7 18.Rad1 Qc7 19.Ne2 Rad8 with dynamic equality. )

**12.dxc5**

Although this is the most common move, it shouldn't give White anything.

In the next game, we will look at the radical 12.d5!? .

**12...Bxc5**

Black is in no rush to swap queens though after 12...Qxd1 13.Rfxd1 Bxc5 14.Ne5 Ra7 15.Rd3 Bxg2 16.Kxg2 Ke7 17.Rad1 Rc8 , I like Black's position in what is probably an approximately balanced ending, V.Tseshkovsky-O.Chebotarev, Kazan 2005.

**13.Qxd8+**

White can also try and keep queens on, hoping to whip up an attack with 13.Qe2 Qe7 14.Ne5 Bxg2 15.Kxg2 Nd7 16.Rfd1 Nxe5 17.Qxe5 O-O 18.Rd3 Rad8 19.Rad1 Rxd3 20.Rxd3 Rc8 21.Ne2 Qb7+ 22.f3 Be7 23.c3 b4 24.b3 Qb5 25.Qe3 Qa5 26.Qd2 bxc3 27.Nxc3 h5 28.Na4 Qxd2+ 29.Rxd2 . Black stands no worse since his bishop is the superior minor piece in the ending, B.Sandstroem-A.Benzoni, correspondence 2010.

**13...Kxd8 14.Ne5**

Principle: If your opponent has the bishop pair, swap one of the bishops away.

**14...Bxg2 15.Kxg2 Ke7 16.Rad1 Ra7**

I already prefer Black in the ending due to his stronger minor piece and also the potential for a queenside minority attack.

**17.a4!?**

There is no reason to create a scene when you can get your way by diplomatic means. This is a possible violation of the principle: Don't encourage confrontation on your opponent's strong wing.

I would just leave the queenside alone and reshuffle the knight with 17.Ne2 .

**17...b4 18.Ne2 Rc8 19.b3?!**

No sound ship can tolerate a gaping breach in her hull for long without taking on water. White voluntarily submits to freezing his own majority, while Black's central and kingside majority remains fluid. Now, the c2-pawn becomes a target for life.

**19...Nd7! 20.Nxd7?!**

Simplification enhances the weakness of the c2-pawn. White violates the principle: The side with the weaker pawn structure should avoid piece swaps.

White has better chances of holding the game with 20.Nc4 Nb6 21.Nb2 .

**20...Rxd7 21.Rxd7+ Kxd7 22.Rd1+**

White can't eliminate his backward c-pawn with 22.c3? bxc3 23.Nxc3 Bxf2 when Black wins a pawn.

**22...Bd6 23.Rd2**

Advantage Black: 1. White is tied down to defence of the c2-pawn and his rook begins his new career in the lucrative field of babysitting. --- 2. Black's bishop is more valuable than White's knight, especially since we have opposite wing pawn majorities (if we can call White's an actual majority!). --- 3. Black's kingside majority is fluid and ready to roll forward, while White's is ice-bound on the other side of the board. --- 4. Black's king is more active than his counterpart. --- In conclusion, Houdini misjudges this position as nearly equal, while in reality, we humans know White fights for his life.

White also struggles after 23.Nd4 Ke7 24.f4 Bc5 25.Nf3 Be3 26.Ne1 f6 and Black intends ...e5 soon.

**23...e5**

Activating his majority.

**24.Nc1 Ke6**

Now it's the king's turn to be mobilized.

**25.Re2**

White has nothing better to do but to wait.

**25...e4 26.f3 Kd5 27.Rd2+ Ke5 28.Re2 Rc3**

The web of causality always catches us in the end, to extract payment for past transgressions. White most certainly regretted his earlier decision to weaken the c3-square.

**29.Nd3+**

29.fxe4 fxe4 30.Nd3+ Kd5 31.Nb2 f5 32.Nc4 Bc5 33.Rd2+ Ke6 34.Kf1 h5 35.Re2 h4! and the g3-weakness soon becomes a target for the rook/bishop pair.

**29...Kd5 30.Ne1 Bc5 31.f4?!**

This makes matters a bit easier for Black.

White had to try the admittedly nauseating 31.Rd2+ Bd4 .

**31...Be3!**

White can barely move and Caruana continues to make grievous inroads into his opponent's peace of mind. It is at this point that White must be seized with that stunned, momentary reality- when it dawns on us that our position is past saving.

Instead, if Black rushes in with the premature 31...e3? 32.Nd3 Kd4 ( 32...Ke4? 33.Nf2+! Kd4 34.Nd1 picks off the exchange ) 33.Ne5 f6 34.Nf3+ Kd5 ( 34...Ke4? 35.Nd2+! Kd4 36.Nb1 has the knight on a different square and yet the same story ) 35.Ne1 Ke4 36.Nf3 White has united and harmonized his once-fragmented position, and it's unlikely Black can make further progress. I admit this isn't exactly a divine phenomenon but then let's agree to call White's blockade a minor miracle.

**32.Kf1 Bc1!**

The bishop refuses to be diverted from his mission.

**33.Ng2**

White is also suffering after 33.Kg2 Kd4 34.Kf1 h5 35.Rg2 f6 36.Re2 h4 37.Kf2 ( 37.gxh4 Bxf4 38.Rf2 Be5 39.Rxf5 Rh3 is also completely hopeless for White ) 37...h3! 38.Kf1 Be3! (zugzwang!) 39.a5 Kd5 and every white move hangs material.

**33...e3!**

Opening a clear path for his king, since White no longer has Kf3.

**34.Ke1**

34.Ne1 Ke4 35.Ng2 Bd2! (the point of manoeuvring the bishop to c1 as the c2-pawn hangs) 36.Ne1 Bxe1 37.Kxe1 Kf3 38.Kf1 Rc6 39.Ke1 Rd6! leaves White in zugzwang.

**34...Ke4**

Black's king is a firm believer in democratic majority rule. Since he represents 100% of the people, his vote always seems to win.

**35.Kd1 Bd2 36.Nh4**

EXERCISE (planning): It appears as if White constructed a fortress to keep Black's king out of f3. How did Caruana smash it with a clear plan? --- ANSWER: Clear the way for the manoeuvre ...Bc3! and ...Bf6, after which the fortress crumbles.

**36...Rc6! 37.c4!**

This doesn't work but it puts up maximum resistance. In a dire emergency, there is but a single goal: Stay alive. Even when our survival odds are infinitesimal, hope tends to cling to such mathematical improbabilities.

He gets crushed if he waits with: 37.Rg2 Bc3 38.Re2 Bf6 39.Ng2 Rd6+ 40.Ke1 ( 40.Kc1 Kf3 wins ) 40...Bc3+ 41.Kf1 Rd1+ 42.Ne1 Bxe1 43.Rxe1 Rd2 and if 44.Re2 , 44...Kf3 forces resignation.

The desperate sac 37.Rxd2 also falls short after 37...exd2 38.Kxd2 Rc5 leaves White in zugzwang, since Black's king infiltrates.

**37...bxc3 38.Kc2**

White's barely functional king retains his sanity, only through ingestion of a daily dose of anti-psychosis medication.

**38...a5**

Clamping down on b4 ideas.

**39.Rg2**

For one accustomed to sorrow, minor irritations are taken in stride. White is one rook move away from zugzwang. --- EXERCISE (planning): White cleverly prevented the ...Bc3, ...Bf6 idea and erected a brand new fortress. How do we break this one down? --- ANSWER: Prepare to sac the exchange on h4.

**39...Rh6!**

White's knight has that awkward sense of intrusion of a party-crasher, about to be unceremoniously tossed out by an irate host.

**40.Re2 Rxh4!**

A key defender is tossed aside, asked not-too-politely to take his astonishment elsewhere. Now the defenders float about aimlessly as dust motes drifting in a shaft of light.

**41.gxh4**

. This is like returning to consciousness from a vivid, sweat-soaked nightmare and then realizing it was no dream. First the mushroom cloud; now comes the aftermath of radiation fallout.

"The hour of your disillusionment is upon you," the king announces to the unhappy rook as he sidles up with 41.gxh4 Kf3 . White's easily alarmed king really needs to calm down, and if failing that, at least pop a valium as he hurried over with 42.Kd3 , only to get hit by the 42...c2! overloading device. White's king continues to be encroached by yet further indignities. We see quite clearly that the consequences of the attempted blockade...well, produced little consequence. --- SUMMARY: Let's go with the bold 6...gxf6 recapture and play for the win.

0-1

### (50)Ivanchuk, V.   --   Volkov, S. 31: European Club Cup, Saint Vincent  2005   1-0   C13 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.Nc3 d5 3.d4 Nf6 4.Bg5 dxe4 5.Nxe4 Be7 6.Bxf6 gxf6 7.Nf3 f5 8.Nc3 a6 9.g3 b5 10.Bg2 Bb7 11.O-O c5**

It's worth mentioning again that Black can avoid the coming piece sac by entering the much calmer line 11...O-O and then playing ...c5 next. There is a lot to be said for avoiding this line, as when a heavily armed opponent braces for an epic battle, nothing piques him or her more than an opponent's indifference.

**12.d5!?**

Daydreams can turn out to be scripts for our future actions. One can't evade an opponent's belligerency forever, if one side is determined to disrupt the smooth flow. Ivanchuk unleashes an amazing new idea. From his theoretical forge, Ivanchuk hammers out a fearsome tool. This is in reality a piece sac and may be the most critical try in the position. GM Neil McDonald gave the move an enthusiastic "!!". --- QUESTION: Does this mean the variation is good for White? --- ANSWER: McDonald thought so. I think it's fully playable for Black, as long as you don't mind entering psychotic complications. In such positions where both sides are adrift in a fathomless ocean of complexity, it isn't surprising that assessments fail to coincide.

**12...b4**

Not much choice.

QUESTION: Can Black decline the piece and be satisfied with just grabbing a pawn with 12...exd5 ? --- ANSWER: No. This isn't a position suited for cautious diplomacy since White's idea is tantamount to an open declaration of war. The defending side in this case has but one survival tool: Compliance with the enemy's wishes. We are committed to acceptance of the piece. The pawn grab fails miserably to 13.Re1 O-O ( 13...d4? fails to 14.Nh4! ) 14.Ne5 when White regains the lost investment on d5 with super active pieces, leaving Black's structure wrecked as well.

**13.dxe6!**

The first upward flying sparks of the attack restore White's sense of enthusiasm like a tonic. White's point: He intends to sac a full piece, not just a pawn.

**13...bxc3 14.exf7+ Kf8**

Black will be subjected to a torrid attack after 14...Kxf7? 15.Ne5+ and if Black tries to hang on to his extra material with 15...Kf6? ( 15...Kg7 16.Bxb7 cxb2 17.Rb1 is also terrible for Black ) 16.Qh5! : ( 16...Qf8 : 17.Bxb7 Ra7 18.Qf3 Kxe5 19.Rad1 Kf6 20.Rd5 Kg6 21.Rxf5! and White is winning. ) ( 16...Bxg2?? 17.Qf7+ Kxe5 18.Rad1! Bxf1 19.f4+! Ke4 20.Qe6+ Kf3 21.Rxf1+ Kg4 22.Qe2+ Kh3 23.Qh5+ leads to mate. ) ( 16...Kxe5?? 17.Bxb7 Ra7 18.Qh6! Bf6 19.Rad1 (threatening both the queen and Rfe1 mate!). ( ) )

**15.Qe2 cxb2 16.Rad1 Qb6 17.Rfe1 Qf6**

QUESTION: How would we assess the aftermath of the sac? --- ANSWER: For the piece, White gets: 1. A dangerous developmental lead. --- 2. Open e- and d-files for his rooks. --- 3. A choking effect on Black's kingside development. --- 4. Good chances to exploit Black's weak squares on d7, e6, e5 and the weak f5-pawn, all of which are vulnerable to White's remaining knight. --- Conclusion: White has full compensation for the piece but I'm not so sure he actually holds any edge. Houdini assesses at virtually dead even, so it's anybody's game.

**18.c3!**

First things first. Ivanchuk eliminates the b2-distraction.

**18...Be4!**

Volkov finds Black's best defensive move.

Black's other choices: 18...Nc6?! 19.Qxb2 Rb8 20.Nh4 Bc8 21.Qe2 Rb6 22.Bd5 Nd8 23.Rd3 Nxf7 24.Re3 Bd8 25.Ng2 Nd6 26.Nf4 and I don't see a good way for Black to untangle while White's pressure continues.

Black can eliminate an important attacker, at the cost of allowing White light-square domination with 18...Bxf3 19.Bxf3 Ra7 20.Qxb2 Kg7 21.Rd5 Qxf7 22.Ree5 (target: the f5-pawn) 22...Rf8 23.Rxf5 Bf6 24.Rxc5 Re7 25.Qb4 Kh8 26.Qf4 Qg7 . Houdini thinks the game is even but I can only see Black losing or drawing, since White, with three pawns for the piece, isn't even down in material.

**19.Nh4!**

Eliminating Black's only truly functional piece.

**19...Nc6**

Black can also try 19...Bxg2 20.Nxg2 Nc6 21.Qxb2 Rd8 22.Rxd8+ Nxd8 23.Nf4 Qxf7 24.Qb8 Kg7 25.Qe5+ Bf6 26.Qxf5 Rf8 27.Qxc5 Kg8 28.Re2 which looks balanced. Black's king now looks safe but White managed to pick off three pawns' compensation for the piece.

**20.Bxe4 fxe4 21.Qxe4 Rd8!?**

McDonald didn't like this move and preferred 21...Rb8 to hang on to his only trump in the position, the b2-pawn. A possible continuation is 22.Nf5 Kxf7 23.Rd7 Kf8! ( Black gets tangled up after 23...Rhe8? 24.Nd6+ Kg8 25.Nxe8 Rxe8 26.Rb7 Qxc3 27.Kg2 Rf8 28.Re2 ) 24.Rb1 Rb6 25.Rc7 (threatening 26.Rxb2! followed by Rxc6, with a vicious attack) 25...Bd8! 26.Rd7 (with the threat of Rd6) 26...Be7 27.Rc7 Bd8 with a draw by repetition.<addx start="26.Rxb2"/>

**22.Rb1 Rd2**

Threatening the f2-pawn while covering the b2-passer.

**23.Nf3 Rd6 24.Rxb2 Kxf7 25.Rb6 Ke8?!**

Black's king continues to exist on the margins with no leeway for error. After this move, Black gets tangled once again.

Black should allow White the coming combination with 25...Kg7! and if 26.Rxc6 Rxc6 27.Qxe7+ Qxe7 28.Rxe7+ Kf6 29.Rd7 h6 30.Rd5 (threat: Ne5 with tricks on d7) 30...Re8 , I don't think Black stands worse in the position, and actually prefer his chances. If he manages to infiltrate and pick off the a2-pawn, he may be winning.

**26.Re3?!**

Black is unlikely to survive the line 26.Ng5! Qxg5 27.Rxc6 Rxc6 28.Qxc6+ Kf8 29.Re4 with a strong attack. 29...Qg6 is met with 30.Qa8+ Kf7 31.Rxe7+ Kxe7 32.Qxh8 Qb1+ 33.Kg2 Qe4+ 34.Kh3 Qf5+ 35.Kh4 and since there is no perpetual check, White has excellent winning chances.

**26...Rf8**

After 26...a5 , White can unfurl the exchange sacrifice 27.Rxc6!? as clearly, there is an air of decadent surfeit in White's conduct of the attack. After 27...Rxc6 28.Ne5 Rd6 29.Qa4+ Kd8 30.Qxa5+ Kc8 31.Qxc5+ Kb7 32.Qb5+ Kc7 , for the rook, White has four pawns and an enduring attack. I don't trust Black's position here.

**27.Qxh7 Rf7**

The dim, disconnected Black's defenders swirl about, more fearful than the one they are supposed to be defending.

Houdini prefers the immediate 27...a5! .

**28.Qg8+! Rf8**

28...Kd7?? walks into 29.Rb7# mate!

**29.Qc4!**

Both the a6- and c5-pawns hang.

**29...a5?**

EXERCISE (planning/combination alert): Black's last move allows White a winning idea. How would you continue here?

Black had to try 29...Rf7 .

**30.Kg2?!**

The king, expecting a rousing ovation, is instead greeted with a spattering of lukewarm applause. In such chaotic positions, we play by the light of unclear data and imperfect assessments.

ANSWER: Pin. 30.Qb5! does the job as: ( 30...Kd7 31.Ne5+ Kc7 and now simplest is 32.Rxc6+ Rxc6 33.Qxc6+ Qxc6 34.Nxc6 Bg5 35.Re6 regaining the piece with an easy win. ) ( 30...Kf7 31.Rxc6 Rxc6 32.Qxc6! Qxc6 33.Ne5+ and White wins. ) ( 30...Kd8 31.Rb8+! Nxb8 32.Qxb8+ Kd7 33.Ne5+ Ke6 34.Qb3+ Kf5 ( 34...Rd5 35.Ng4+ picks off the queen ) 35.Qc2+ Kg5 36.h4+ Kh5 37.Qe2+ Kh6 38.Ng4+ wins the queen. )

**30...Rf7 31.Qxc5**

So far Ivanchuk's attack has been a bit like a guy misreading the map and finding his destination anyway. Suddenly White is up material, with four pawns for the piece.

**31...Kf8**

Black's harassed king feels much the same way a politician would upon encountering a heckler in his audience.

**32.Qh5 Kg8 33.Qg4+ Rg7 34.Qc4+ Rf7 35.Qg4+**

35.Rb5! intending to transfer the rook to the kingside looks quite dangerous for Black.

**35...Rg7 36.Qc8+ Bf8 37.Re8 Rg6?**

EXERCISE (planning/combination alert) : Black, under tremendous pressure, blunders. White to play and win.

Black is still hanging on after the correct 37...Rf7! .

**38.h4!**

White opens up g5 for the knight, adding another deadly attacker into the fray.

Also winning was... ANSWER #2: 38.Nh4! intending Nf5. After 38...Rg5 39.Rxc6! Rxc6 40.Rxf8+! , Black's queen will be overloaded. Following 40...Qxf8 41.Qxc6 , the deficit of a knight and four pawns is way too big for a single rook.

**38...Qf7**

The only way to play on was 38...Re6 39.Ng5 Rxe8 40.Qxe8 Qf5 41.Rb5! Qf6 42.Qe4 .

**39.Rb7 Qf6 40.Ng5 Ne5**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Signs of inevitable decay are all around Black's position. How our ears long for those achingly beautiful two words from an opponent - "I resign". Find one powerful move and Black's resistance melts away. --- ANSWER: Interference.

**41.Rf7!**

When a fist collides with a jaw, the fist generally emerges triumphant, since it enjoys the great benefit of being in motion, while the jaw remains a stationary target.

This punch sends Black reeling after 41.Rf7 Nxf7 42.Rxf8+ Kg7 43.Rg8+ Kh6 44.Qf8+ and powerful, restraining hands grab Black's king from behind, while another pair of hands apply the chloroform. Black is left reeling and 44...Rg7 45.Nxf7+ Qxf7 46.Qxd6+ wins the house. --- SUMMARY: This is not a variation for readers whose lives are shaped by dull routine. If you don't want to enter the storm, then remember, you also have the much calmer option of 11...0-0, and then playing ...c5 on the next move. So the piece sac version is optional for Black. But if you do choose to enter this line, computer analysis indicates the position is complex and fully playable for Black. However there may be problems for our side from a practical standpoint, since White is on the attack, with an easier to play over the board. So be careful about choosing to enter this one.

1-0

### (51)Jovanovic, Z.   --   Najer, E. 32: European Championship, Dresden  2007   1/2-1/2   C13 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 dxe4 5.Nxe4 Be7 6.Bxf6 gxf6 7.Nf3 f5 8.Nc3 a6 9.Qd2**

Ambition taps White on the shoulder and whispers sweet seductions into his ear. This line isn't played as often as the kingside fianchetto lines that we examined previously in the chapter. Yet White's no-nonsense plan is rather dangerous for our side. --- QUESTION: What is White's intent? --- ANSWER: 1. Castle queenside and blast open the centre with d5, playing on the principles: Open the position and create confrontation when leading in development. --- 2. White's last move gives him access to the h6-square with his queen. This in turn discourages Black from castling kingside. Now the trouble is that the queenside isn't so secure for Black's king either, since we intend the loosening ...b5. --- QUESTION: All this sounds like it is in White's favour. What are Black's plusses? --- ANSWER: Our benefits: 1. White wilfully castles into our queenside pawn storm. --- 2. As we saw in the previous game, White's d5 often comes with a cost, since Black has access to the undermining ...b4.

**9...b5 10.O-O-O Bb7!?**

This move allows White a dangerous piece sac.

If you go through the remainder of the game and you don't like what Black gets, then we have the alternatives: 10...Qd6 to meet d5 with ...e5. --- After 11.Qe3 Nd7 12.d5 Nb6 13.dxe6 Qxe6 14.Qf4 Bd6 15.Qh4 Be7 16.Qf4 Bd6 17.Qh4 Be7 18.Qf4 , White forced a draw by repetition, D.Bogatov-W.Tseng, correspondence 2010.

I don't think Black fully equalizes with 10...b4 11.Ne2 Bb7 12.Kb1 Nd7 13.Nf4 Nf6 14.Bc4 , A.Naiditsch-U.Von Herman, Germany 2010. I prefer White's attacking chances after 14...Qd6 15.Ne5 .

**11.d5!**

QUESTION: But doesn't Black simply win a pawn with ...b4 next, which undermines the defender of d5? --- ANSWER: Brace yourself: White doesn't intend to move the knight and just like in the previous game, he plans a piece sac for a dangerous attack. Keep watching!

**11...b4 12.Bc4!**

We can all agree on one thing - White isn't much of a diplomat. His last move is an open declaration of war. The once hazy prismatic outlines of his intent crystallize into clear focus and are as audible as the words "Prepare to be checkmated!" Here is the piece sac which we had better take seriously, because Houdini actually prefers White here.

**12...bxc3**

Diametrically opposing forces engage in a fierce battle of material versus initiative. Black must accept the challenge.

If Black declines purchasing stock in the company with 12...O-O? , taking this action gives White a strong attack without having to invest. After 13.Ne2 ( 13.Qh6! looks strong here as well ) 13...exd5 14.Bxd5 c6 15.Bc4 Qxd2+ 16.Rxd2 c5 , Z.Jovanovic-P.Kiriakov, Internet (blitz) 2005, White stands clearly better due to his superior pawn structure after 17.Bd5 .

**13.Qxc3**

The witch traces strange patterns in the air. Almost immediately, Black's king begins to experience growing discomfort throughout his body. It may feel like the gates of hell swung open for Black. It's important to grab a logic foothold in such an irrational position. For the piece, White gets a lot as: 1. He leads massively in development. --- 2. He threatens our h8-rook with his queen. --- 3. He prepares to decimate our defences with dxe6 next.

**13...e5!**

The only move, without which we would be busted.

If instead 13...Bf6? , White threatens both the b7-bishop as well as dxe6 with 14.Qb4 Qc8 15.dxe6 fxe6 16.Bxe6! (this overloading shot crushes Black) 16...Qxe6 17.Qxb7 Qb6 ( 17...Qc6 18.Rhe1+ Kf7 19.Qb3+ Kg7 20.Nd4! Bxd4 21.Re7+ Kg6 22.Qf7+ Kg5 23.h4+ forces mate ) 18.Qxa8 Qxb2+ 19.Kd2 Qc3+ 20.Ke2 Qxc2+ 21.Rd2 Qc4+ 22.Rd3 Qxa2+ 23.Nd2 O-O 24.Qd5+ Qxd5 25.Rxd5 and White should convert this. Black's remaining pawns are scattered and isolated.

**14.Nxe5**

14.Qxe5?! O-O 15.Rhe1 Bd6 16.Qxf5 Bc8 17.Qh5 Qf6 18.Bd3 h6 and I prefer Black whose king looks safe.

**14...O-O 15.d6!**

This logical line opening idea appears to be new.

White can also try 15.Qb3 but it doesn't feel like an improvement over 15 d6. Following 15...Qd6 16.Qxb7 Qxe5 17.Qxa8 Qf4+ 18.Kb1 Qxc4 19.Rhe1 , S.Ciesielski-E.Sowden, correspondence 2011, Black's game looks playable and dynamically balanced after 19...Bd6 .

**15...Bxd6**

EXERCISE (combination alert): White can regain his material investment with a tactical trick. If you search carefully, you will find something of great value just lying around, waiting to be picked up. --- ANSWER: Double attack.

**16.Nxf7**

White gets a slightly better version with the more accurate move order.

ANSWER #2: Capturing with the other minor piece works as well after 16.Bxf7+! Rxf7 17.Qb3 Qg5+ 18.Kb1 Bxe5 19.Qxb7 Rf8 20.Qxa8 .

**16...Rxf7 17.Bxf7+ Kxf7 18.Qb3+**

"I am grateful in advance for the coming gallant sacrifice of your life, for the betterment of the realm," White's queen tells the soon-to-die b7-bishop. The point: White picks up the bishop with a double attack.

**18...Kg7 19.Qxb7 Nd7**

White got a rook and two pawns for two minor pieces. Houdini says the game is even and Black's remaining pawns are all isolated. At last, hope timidly peeks out with a sunset at the end of a rainy day. Surprisingly, I don't believe Black's king is in danger, since his domination of the dark squares keeps it safer than it appears. In fact, it is Black who may get attacking chances due to the open b-file and the more dangerous minor pieces.

**20.Rxd6!?**

The rook's grim reticence ends with a pent-up outburst of profanity, directed at Black's meddling bishop. The move is a sign of respect for Black's dark-square control. White agrees to go back down a piece to eliminate Black's best piece.

White probably feared that Black may take over the initiative after 20.Qd5 Qg5+ as a wave of fighting spirit surges through the queen's once-cowering spirit. After 21.Kb1 Rb8 , the impending attack on the b2-pawn will be a cause for concern for White. --- Consciously, Black plans to toe the line and defend. Unconsciously, a completely different desire swirls about, just waiting to bubble to the surface, as he eyes White's king.

**20...cxd6 21.Rd1 Rb8 22.Qxa6 Qf6 23.c3 Rb6 24.Qc4**

White got three pawns for the piece with approximate balanced chances.

**24...Nc5 25.Qd4**

White logically believes that an ending is the best place to convert his pawns into a potential queen.

Houdini likes the exceedingly non-human idea 25.b4!? Na4 26.Rd3 which disorganizes Black's queenside pieces at the cost of weakening his king.

**25...Ra6 26.Kb1 h5!**

A good move. In a queening race, Black may have to pick off some kingside pawns and attempt to promote either the f- or h-pawn.

**27.f3 Rc6 28.Kc2 Ra6**

Black is satisfied with a draw.

**29.Kb1 Rc6 30.Kc2 Ra6 31.a3**

But White isn't! We soon see that he may have overestimated his chances.

**31...Qxd4 32.Rxd4 Kf6 33.Rh4 Kg5 34.Rc4 Ne6 35.Rc8 f4!**

The g2-pawn is now a potential target and White must watch for ideas like ...Ra5 and ...Rg5. If White plays g3, he loosens his kingside pawns which become vulnerable to the black knight's attentions.

**36.Rg8+ Kf6 37.Rh8 Ra5**

Setting up ...Rg5. Note that White hasn't been able to activate his queenside passers, since the a3-pawn will hang after the white b-pawn moves.

**38.Rh6+ Kf7 39.g3**

Black is also not worse after 39.a4 Rxa4 40.Rxh5 Ra1 .

**39...Re5!**

A nomad makes do with whatever resources he may lay his hands on. Now there is the potential for a major race between kingside versus queenside queening attempts.

**40.gxf4 Re2+ 41.Kb3**

White's king feels somewhat marooned on c2. He continues to feel like a zoological specimen, trapped within its enclosure, pacing without purpose. The trouble with Kb3 is that the king blocks the run of the b2-pawn.

**41...Rxh2 42.f5 Ng5**

If instead 42...Ng7 43.Rxd6 Nxf5 44.Rd1 Rg2 45.a4 h4 46.a5 Rg8 47.Rh1 Ke6 48.Kc4 Kd7 49.b4 Rc8+ 50.Kd3 Kc6 , this king is the weary traveller who sees an endless stretch of road ahead of him, before he reaches the next town. Continuing with 51.c4 Re8 52.Kd2 Rh8 53.Kd3 h3 54.Rh2 Ng3 55.b5+ Kc5 56.a6 Kb6 57.c5+! Kxc5 58.a7 Nh5 59.Ke3 Ng7 60.Rxh3 Ra8 , the game is drawn.

**43.a4 Nxf3 44.a5 Nd2+ 45.Kb4 Ne4 46.Ka3 Rh1**

Halting a6.

**47.Ka2 Rh4 48.Ka3**

Neither side can make progress.

48.a6 Nc5 wins the a-pawn.

**48...Rh1 49.Ka2 Rh4 50.a6 Nc5**

Black zealously guards a4, the gateway to White's promotion attempts. His move wins the a-pawn.

**51.b4**

In any case, after 51.b4 Nxa6 52.Rxd6 Nb8 53.b5 Ke7 54.Rh6 Nd7 , the game should eventually be drawn.

SUMMARY: In my opinion, theory has it backwards. The 9.Qd2 line should be White's main line over the fianchetto versions (which I am not afraid of). It feels very dangerous for our side. I favour the 7...a6 lines (which we will look at for the rest of the chapter) and prefer to dodge this variation. White's piece sac looks quite sound though there are ways for us to dodge White's intent, by substituting with 10...Qd6!, which denies White the piece sac.<skip/>

### (52)Stefansson, H.   --   Morozevich, A. 33: European Club Cup (team), Reykjavik  1999   0-1   C13 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 dxe4 5.Nxe4 Be7 6.Bxf6 gxf6 7.Nf3 a6**

This move has turned into one of the hottest trends in the Classical French, mainly due to super-GM Alexander Morozevich's deadly advocacy from Black's side.

QUESTION: So Black holds back on ...f5. What are the benefits of avoiding 7...f5 and replacing it with 7...a6?

ANSWER: The following:

1. Black halts any annoying future Bb5+ or Nb5 (after ...c5,...cxd4 and Nxd4) ideas.

2. If White gets super aggressive and castles queenside, Black has a tailor-made pawn storm with ...b5.

3. Once Black plays ...b5, this discourages White from playing c4, since Black will respond with ...bxc4 and then manoeuvre a piece to the newly-created d5-hole. Black then can back up with ...c6, shoring up the d5-square. In fact, if you fast-forward to Moro's game against Polgar later in the chapter, we will see him do just this.
4. The ...b5 thrust gains a tempo if White develops his bishop to the natural c4-square.
5. If White attempts to blast open the centre with d5 (as we saw in the last game), Black has access to ...b4 tricks, undermining a future white knight on c3, which in turn undermines White's control over d5.
6. By holding back on ...f5, Black not only retains control over the key e5-square, but also refuses to chase White's knight to c3 where it helps White play for d5.

**8.Bd3**

This move contains more venom than is immediately apparent.

QUESTION: Why play the bishop to d3 when White can play: 8.Bc4 intending d5?

ANSWER: Your suggestion is certainly playable but Black's 7...a6 is precisely designed against such straightforward play from White. Black follows up with the convenient tempo gainer 8...b5 9.Bb3 Bb7 (not only halting d5, but also attacking the e4-knight) 10.Qe2:<level start="7...a6"/>

10...Nd7 and here we branch off again as White has the choice of castling on either side:

11.O-O-O Nb6 12.Rhe1 Bd5 13.Bxd5 , T.Michalczak-R.Buhmann,Boeblingen 2002. Black looks to be in good shape on the light squares after 13...Qxd5 14.Kb1 O-O-O .

11.a4 O-O 12.O-O Nb6 13.axb5 axb5 14.Nc5?! ( the desire to try a cheapo on the e6-pawn tempts White into damaging his structure and correct was 14.c3 Bd5 when Black stands even due to his central light square bind ) 14...Bxf3 15.gxf3 ( 15.Qxf3? hangs a pawn to 15...Qxd4 ) 15...Rxa1 16.Rxa1 Kh8! ( 16...Qxd4? walks into White's intended cheapo 17.Nxe6 Qxb2 18.Re1 ) 17.c3 Rg8+ 18.Kh1 Qf8 19.Ne4 Qg7 20.Ng3 f5 and here, White gets nervous about Black's build up on the g-file and agrees to an inferior ending with 21.Qe5 Qxe5 22.dxe5 Bc5 . Black stood better in the ending and went on to convert his structural advantage, C.Vitoux,-I.Efimov, France 2006.

10...Bd5 11.O-O c6 12.Ned2 Nd7 13.a4 was J.Becerra-C.Lakdawala, Internet (blitz) 2010, when 13...Bxb3 14.Nxb3 O-O looks playable for Black.

In this chapter, we will also cover 8.Qd2

8.c4

and 8.g3 .

**8...f5**

Morozevich opts for a quick ...f5.

Black can also hold back with 8...b5 9.Qe2 Bb7 : ( . White can play cautiously with 10.c3 Nd7 11.O-O though believe it or not, White's king may actually be safer on the queenside, since by castling kingside, he walks into Black's open g-file. 11...O-O (remember that Black's king is a lot safer than it looks on the kingside) 12.Rad1 Kh8 13.c4 bxc4 14.Bxc4 Nb6 . This move ensures that White will never get the chance to blast open with d5, since Black's entire army exerts control over the square. After 15.Bb3 Rg8 16.Rfe1 Qf8 17.Ng3 Rd8 18.Bc2 Nd5 , Black already stands clearly better and is ready to build an attack with ...Qg7, ...f5 and ...f4, H.Heimsoth-A.Grischuk, Dos Hermanas 2003. ) ( . Black can respond to 10.O-O-O with 10...f5 11.Ned2 Bd5 with the intention of backing up the bishop with ...c6, which is a standard plan for Black in this line. Following 12.Kb1 Nc6 13.c3 Rg8 14.g3 Rb8 , Black can simply leave his king in the centre or shift him over to f8 and then prepare to pry open the queenside. ( ) )

**9.Ng3**

QUESTION: Why post to the knight g3 where it can't help enforce the d5 break? --- ANSWER: This is actually White's main choice in the position. White assumes Black will castle kingside and so adds an attacker to the region.

Let's look at other options: 9.Ned2 c5 10.dxc5 Qa5 11.Qe2 Nd7 ( 11...Nc6 12.O-O Qxc5 13.c3 looks at least even for Black ) 12.c6 bxc6 13.c3 Bb7 14.Nc4 Qc7 15.O-O-O c5 and Black achieved a dynamic position, V.Zhelnin-K.Sakaev, Smolensk 2000.

9.Nc3 is rarely played. In fact, I only see two games in my database with it. Black gets a good position after 9...b5 10.Qe2 Bb7 11.O-O-O b4 12.Na4 Qd5 13.b3 Rg8 14.Rhg1 Nd7 .

**9...c5**

Chipping away at White's pawn centre.

**10.dxc5**

This is White's main move but the trouble is once Black removes White's d4-pawn from the mix, it is Black who enjoys the greater central control. The only way to break up Black's centre is some kind of piece sac which is not easy to engineer.

After GM Neil McDonald's suggestion of 10.d5 , we have: ( 10...Qxd5 11.Nxf5! This is McDonald's idea and both sides must play carefully with 11...c4! ( 11...exf5?? is met with 12.Bb5+ winning Black's queen ) 12.Nxe7 ( 12.Ne3?? loses to 12...Qa5+ ) 12...Kxe7 13.Be2 and Black must give up a tempo with 13...Qxd1+ ( 13...Rd8?! allows White to retain queens with 14.Qc1! ) 14.Rxd1 b5 15.a4 Bb7 16.O-O Rg8 17.g3 Nc6 , resulting in an even ending. ) ( 10...f4 is also interesting and more dynamic than immediate capture on d5. Following 11.Nh5 Qxd5 12.Nxf4 Qd6 13.Qd2 Nc6 14.Rd1 Bd7 15.Qc3 Nd4 16.Ne2 Bf6 17.Be4 Bb5 18.Nfxd4 cxd4 19.Qf3 , J.Azarya-W.Medina, Satka 2011, I like Black's position after 19...Qb4+ 20.c3 Qxb2 21.Bd3 Bxd3 22.Rxd3 Bg7 23.Nxd4 O-O 24.O-O Rac8 when the c3- and a2-pawns remain weak while Black's king looks safe enough for now. )

**10...Qa5+ 11.c3 Qxc5**

I actually prefer Black, due to the bishop pair, dark-square control and greater central influence. I don't believe White's developmental lead and potential attacking chances fully make up for it.

**12.Qd2 Nc6**

Black can also play the immediate 12...h5 which keeps White's queen out of h6 and also discourages White from castling kingside.

**13.O-O-O**

I don't think White's king is safe on the kingside, with the open g-file and Black about to play ...h5.

Premature is 13.Qh6?! due to 13...Ne5! 14.Nxe5 ( 14.Be2?? walks into the double attack 14...Ng4 threatening both the queen on h6 and the f2-pawn ) 14...Qxe5+ 15.Ne2 Bd7 when Black stands clearly better.

**13...h5 14.h4**

To fix h5 as a target and rule out annoying ...h4 ideas.

**14...b5**

Morozevich prepares ...b4.

**15.Kb1 b4 16.Rc1**

An idea, no matter how profound, must also be reconciled with the position's logistical details. Otherwise, it floats within the realm of the theoretical, never to meet the practical. I feel that is happening here. White relies on his developmental lead but then what? He needs some kind of central sac, perhaps on the f5-pawn to fan his attack. I didn't spot any versions which worked during the game. Essentially, the mine of White's viable ideas ran dry, due to Black's long term advantages.

QUESTION: Why wouldn't White close queenside lines with 16.c4 ? --- ANSWER: Your suggestion does close queenside lines, but at the high cost of weakening White badly on the d4- and e5-dark squares. Black may later be able to play ...Bf6 and weaken the diagonal further with ...a5, ...a4 and ...a3.

**16...Bb7 17.Qe2**

17.cxb4 Qxb4 18.Qe2 Kf8 19.Rhd1 Bf6 and Black looks like he has the more potent attacking chances. He has the open b-file as well as the queen and dark-squared bishop taking aim at b2.

**17...Qb6**

Covering the a6-pawn so that he can develop his sleeping a8-rook. Also, I think Moro is attempting to stir up trouble by provoking a sac on the f5-pawn.

After 17...Qa5 18.Rhe1 Kf8 19.Ng5 Bxg5 20.hxg5 h4 21.Nh5 , A.Petrushin-D.Elizarov, Belorechensk 2009, Black should enter the complications with 21...bxc3 22.g6 Nb4 23.g7+ Ke7 24.a3 Nxd3 25.gxh8=Q Rxh8 26.Qxd3 Be4 27.Rxe4 fxe4 28.Qxe4 Rxh5 which Houdini rates at even.

**18.Nd2**

White hits the h5-pawn but this feels like a flea bite when compared to his troubles on the queenside.

18.Bxf5?! looks slightly unsound and after 18...exf5 19.Nxf5 Kf8 20.Rhe1 Bf6 21.cxb4 Rd8 , I don't believe White got full compensation for the piece. In fact, Black's attack looks even more potent than White's.

**18...Rd8 19.Rhd1 bxc3**

Morozevich finally opens the b-file.

**20.Rxc3 Kf8**

Black's king looks relatively well protected, unlike his insecure b1-counterpart.

**21.Rdc1?!**

After this move, White's position begins to sink swiftly.

More accurate is 21.Rb3 Qa7 22.Nf3 to cover the d4-square. Following 22...Ba8 23.a3 a5 24.Rb5 Bf6 , Black continues to stand better.

**21...Nb4 22.Bc4 Bxh4!**

Not motivated by greed. Let's outline the key factors behind the move: 1. Black clears the path for ...Bg5. --- 2. This in turn allows ...h4. --- 3. The h8-rook isn't needed to cover the h5-pawn anymore so Black can try to bring the rook back into relevance.

**23.Rh1?**

White's last chance to put up resistance was 23.a3 Bg5 24.Ngf1 Nd5 25.Bxd5 Bxd5 26.Ne3 .

**23...Bf6**

In a sense, this is a double attack because as soon as the rook moves, Black has tricks on the b2-pawn.

**24.Rb3**

24.Rcc1?? is crushed by 24...Nxa2! .

**24...Qd6**

White has all sorts of hanging issues.

**25.Rxh5**

After 25.a3 Bxg2 26.Rd1 h4! , the h-pawn turns into a queening threat in the middlegame. Following 27.Nxf5 exf5 28.Rxb4 h3 29.f3 Qe7 30.Qf2 f4! (intending ...Qe3!) 31.Re1 Qxe1+! 32.Qxe1 h2 33.Rb7 Rh7 , Black emerges a rook up from the deal once his h-pawn reaches h1.

**25...Rxh5 26.Nxh5**

White's knight prances about with the abandon of a gazelle on the surface of the moon. --- EXERCISE (combination alert): The goal is within our grasp as black attackers dance around White's king like evil imps. What tactical theme did Black exploit with his next move? --- ANSWER: Weak back rank.

**26...Be4+! 27.Kc1**

In some positions we are left without choice, with only a single course of action.

Once we are busted, it does us no good to regret past sins or declare resolutions to follow paths of virtue in the future, mainly since there will be no future for us: 27.Nxe4?? Qd1+ (the queen is complicit in the crime) 28.Qxd1 Rxd1# mate!.

27.Ka1?? Qxd2 forces mate.

**27...Nxa2+ 28.Kd1 Bg5**

Even stronger was 28...Bxb2! with a fork threat on c3.

**29.f4 Bxf4 30.Nxf4 Qxf4 31.Rb6 Qh2**

The queen lurks in darkness behind the curtain. "Some may call it eavesdropping," thinks Black's queen, "But what am I to do? One cannot turn off one's ears."

**32.Qf2 Qh1+ 33.Bf1 Bd3 34.Qc5+**

The queen's tone is one of a haughty rebuke. The fact that Black's king remains alive, mocks her, since she considers his very existence an affront. But the black king takes it in stride since he knows that in the end, he is the one with the power.

**34...Kg8 35.Qe7 Rc8**

Black knight and rook synchronize their intent upon the c1-mating square.

**36.Qg5+ Kh7**

"Get thee hence, vile temptress!" rages Black's king. She thinks to herself: "Lord, what drama..." There is no perpetual check.

**37.Rb7**

Now is not the right time for the rook to be communing with nature.

Also futile is 37.Ke1 Bxf1 38.Nxf1 Rc1+ 39.Kd2 Rxf1 40.Rb7 Rf2+ 41.Ke3 when the king reluctantly begins his long march to oblivion. He sighs deeply, realizing the black queen's presence affects his mood jarringly different than her absence. Black continues the hunt with 41...Qe1+ 42.Kd4 and the king desperately hopes to give his ardent suitor's love the slip to no avail as 42...Qe4+ 43.Kc5 Qd5+ 44.Kb6 leaves the king the spent swimmer from a capsized boat, who sees the shoreline but knows he lacks the endurance to reach it. With 44...Rxb2+ 45.Kc7 Rxb7+ 46.Kc8 Qd7# , the queen smiles, takes a soothing sip of wine, closes her eyes and sighs contentedly, upon listening to the white king's screams.

**37...Rc1#**

. White's king, like mad King Lear, is more a sinner than against sinning. --- SUMMARY: After 10 dxc5, I prefer Black's bishop pair, dark-square control and superior central influence, to White's developmental lead. Essentially, Black allows him or herself to fall behind in development for strategic gains, borrowing time but then later refusing to repay the debt. It feels to me like White's temporary initiative and developmental lead arise and ebb quickly, a fogging breath on a mirror which clears away almost instantaneously.

0-1

### (53)Sutovsky, E.   --   Morozevich, A. 34: Pamplona Open, Mallorca  1999   0-1   C13 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 dxe4 5.Nxe4 Be7 6.Bxf6 gxf6 7.Nf3 a6 8.Qd2**

QUESTION: I assume White prepares to castle long? --- ANSWER: Yes. White is also interested in infiltration ideas like Qh6 or Qf4 later on.

**8...b5**

Once again, Black has the early ...f5 option.

QUESTION: After 8...f5 9.Nc3 b5 10.O-O-O , can you recall how, instead of allowing the dangerous piece sacrifice with 10...Bb7 11 d5 b4 12 Bc4, a strong alternative can be essayed? --- ANSWER: Essentially, the line transposes to Jovanovic-Najer (Game 32) and in the notes I recommended 10...Qd6! 11.Qe3 ( 11.d5 is met with the bypassing 11...e5 ) 11...Nd7 12.d5 . We already looked at this analysis in Jovanovic-Najer, but it's worth going over again. Black sidesteps the central thrust with 12...Nb6! ( Black must play carefully as 12...e5? walks into 13.Bxb5! axb5 14.Nxb5 Qc5 15.Qxc5 Bxc5 16.Nxc7+ Kd8 17.Nxa8 Bb7 18.Rhe1 f6 19.Re2 Bxa8 20.c4 and those four connected queenside passers will soon surge forward ) 13.dxe6 Qxe6 14.Qf4 Bd6 15.Qh4 Be7 16.Qf4 ( Black stands at least even after 16.Qd4 O-O when ...b4 is threatened ) 16...Bd6 17.Qh4 Be7 18.Qf4 with a draw by repetition, D.Bogatov-W.Tseng, correspondence 2010.

**9.Qh6?!**

White's second choice in the position, which I feel is a dead end. White's idea is Qg7, winning the h-pawn. --- QUESTION: What objection could you have with infiltration? --- ANSWER: Essentially, White agrees to fight Black on the dark squares, which is Black's strength. Also, White loses a lot of time if he goes after the h7-pawn.

Alternatively, White has: 9.O-O-O which is considered White's best move by Morozevich. After 9...Bb7 , White has: ( 10.Bd3 Nd7 11.Kb1 , J.Klovans-P.Nielsen, Istanbul 2000. At this point I would play 11...f5 12.Ng3 h5 13.Ne2 h4 14.h3 Rg8 15.Rhg1 c5 and I prefer Black, due to the bishop pair, the open g-file and the fact that White's centre is about to dissolve. ) ( 10.Qe3 Nd7 11.Kb1 , C.Pekun-N.Pushkov, Rogaska Slatina 2009. Black can continue with 11...f5 12.Nc3 Bf6 13.d5 Qe7 14.Nd4 f4! 15.Qd2 O-O-O 16.a4 Bxd4 17.Qxd4 b4 18.Ne4 exd5 19.Nd2 Qd6 . I don't think White has full compensation for the pawn, since Black activates his queenside majority with ...c5 next. ( ) )

9.Qe3 with the idea of suppressing Black's ...c5 break, while covering e4. After 9...Bb7 10.O-O-O Qd5! (Houdini's suggestion - since Black's queen wants to post to d6, the move gains a tempo through the double attack on e4 and a2, forcing White's knight back to c3) 11.Nc3 Qd6 12.Bd3 Nd7 13.Rhe1 O-O-O 14.Ne4 ( I would challenge the diagonal immediately with 14.Be4 Nb6 ) 14...Qb6 (now White can't prevent the freeing ...c5) 15.Ned2 c5 16.Be4 Bxe4 17.Nxe4 Rhg8 18.g3 cxd4 19.Nxd4 Ne5 , Black achieved a good position since ...Nc4 is in the air, E.Janosi-C.Carbonell Bofill, correspondence 2008.

**9...Bb7 10.Bd3**

Suddenly White gets cold feet and decides not to play for the grab of Black's h7-pawn.

QUESTION: Why didn't White win a pawn with 10.Qg7 ? --- ANSWER: Black takes over the initiative and regains the material with interest after 10...Rf8 11.Qxh7 f5 12.Ned2 Bf6 and Black regains the pawn, since the d4-pawn hangs. Black also threatens to trap White's wayward queen with ...Rh8. After 13.Qh6 Bxd4 ( handing over the dark-squared bishop and regaining the pawn looks more accurate than speculating with 13...c5 14.a4 Nd7 15.Qf4 cxd4 16.axb5 though even here, Black's imposing centre and active pieces easily compensate for the lost pawn ) 14.Nxd4 Qxd4 15.O-O-O?! a dubious pawn sac, ( in order to dodge a slightly worse ending after 15.c3 Qe5+ 16.Qe3 Qxe3+ 17.fxe3 Nd7 ) 15...Qxf2 16.Qg5 , G.Meyer-A.Walton, Edinburgh 2003. I don't believe in White's compensation after 16...Nc6 17.Nf3 Ne7 18.h4 Rg8 .

**10...Nd7 11.Ng3!?**

A new move and not such a great one. Perhaps it was driven more by emotion than logic. White plans Nh5. The Austrian satirist Karl Kraus lampooned the sentimentality and emotions which the German poet Heinrich Heine described in his poem about a girl experiencing a sunset - "My girl, now don't you frown. This happens all the time; In front here it goes down, and comes back up from behind". The question remains - Would we play better or worse if our decisions were devoid of emotion? Emotion sparks imagination but also induces us into rash action. In this case, Sutovsky perhaps allows his passion for attacking chess distract him from central obligations and his position soon decays. So rather than react to the crisis as it unfolds, White interprets events to justify a semi-sound attack he had been itching to play all along. Severance of long-worn habits isn't easy to accomplish, even when our rational mind orders us to do so.

A look at the alternatives: GM Neil McDonald suggests the psychologically difficult move 11.Qe3 which essentially admits that his queen excursion to h6 was a fiasco.

Tournament praxis has seen 11.O-O-O f5 12.Neg5 Bxg5+! 13.Nxg5 Qf6! 14.Qh5 ( not 14.Qxf6? Nxf6 15.Rhg1 Rg8 16.Nf3 Rxg2! 17.Rxg2 Bxf3 18.Rg3 Bxd1 19.Kxd1 Ke7 and Black emerges a clean extra pawn up in the ending ) 14...Qg6 15.Qh4 O-O-O ( Black also has 15...Rg8! 16.Nf3 Qf6 17.Qh3 Bxf3 18.Qxf3 Qg5+ 19.Kb1 Qxg2 20.Qe3 Qd5 21.Be2 O-O-O and White has insufficient compensation for the pawn ) 16.Rhg1 Rdg8 17.Nh3 , T.Wedberg-P.Nielsen, New York 2000. ( 17.Nf3 Bxf3 18.gxf3 Qf6 favours Black structurally ) 17...Qf6 18.Qxf6 . Black can continue 18...Nxf6 19.Nf4 h5 with a slight but pleasant kingside initiative.

**11...f5 12.Nh5**

Threatening devastation with a knight check on g7.

Most definitely not 12.O-O-O?? Bxf3 13.gxf3 when 13...Bg5+ would be embarrassing for White. The delusional white queen's flower-scented world of soft tinkling music comes to an abrupt and violent end. Of course GMs (and I hope IMs also!) don't fall for such traps.

**12...Bf8 13.Qe3**

Threat: Bxf5.

Morozevich suggested 13.Ng7+ Bxg7 14.Qxg7 Qf6 15.Qxf6 Nxf6 16.Be2 which he declared equal. I slightly prefer Black, due to a strong bishop, the open g-file and control of key central light squares.

**13...Nf6**

EXERCISE (critical decision): Analyse 14 Qe5. Should White play it? Or should he just exchange knights on f6? This position can only be solved in the depths, not on the surface. Look deeply and you will discover the answer:

**14.Qe5?**

ANSWER: Moro's 13...Nf6!! was a cunningly concealed trap and the protoplasmic birth of a deeply involved plan. White's last move, although unbelievably tempting, is incorrect, due to Black's coming exchange sac.

White should continue 14.Nxf6+ Qxf6 15.a4 b4 16.O-O when Black's bishop pair and the open g-file are worth more than White's superior structure. Play may continue 16...Qh6 when Black can claim a small edge.

**14...Nxh5!**

Morozevich's idea: Step 1: Lure White's queen to h8. The pin proves not to be the ruinous handicap we suspected it might be. --- This shot punctures White's previously carefree mood. It is an awful feeling when you construct a subtle plan weaved on gossamer threads, only to watch in horror as your opponent casually tosses a lit match to your once beautiful construct.

Sutovsky undoubtedly counted on the tactic 14...Be7? 15.Bxb5+! .

**15.Qxh8**

The queen continues to build her web of lies, since speaking the truth never worked out well for her in the past. White, now invested inextricably to his plan, has no option other than to follow through. --- Step 2: Damage White's kingside structure and thus irreparably weaken the dark squares.

**15...Bxf3 16.gxf3 Nf6!**

Step 3: Lock White's queen in on h8, after which her escape costs White material. White's queen soon realizes that Camelot loses a lot of its charm if your job is castle scullion maid.

**17.Rg1**

White doesn't have time to cover the d4-pawn.

After 17.c3? , Black has 17...Ke7! with the idea of ...Qd5! and ...Bh6, trapping White's queen and 18.Rg1 ( 18.O-O-O?? hangs the queen to 18...Bh6+ ) 18...Qd5 19.Rg3 Bh6 traps the queen.

17.d5 doesn't bother Black at all. Again, Black plays 17...Ke7 and 18.c4 Qd6 19.Rd1 Rd8 renders White defenseless to the coming ...Bh6.

**17...Qxd4**

Black threatens ...0-0-0, followed by ...Bh6.

**18.Rg8**

Complete desperation, since Black is about to castle and follow with 19...Bb4+ or 19...Bh6 winning the queen. Step 4: The strange alliance suddenly becomes comprehensible. Black clears the path for the a8-rook to eventually attack White's trapped queen.<add start="19...Bb4+" value="18.-- O-O-O 19.--"/>

**18...Ke7!**

Black's forces uncoil like an unfolding cobra preparing to strike.

**19.Kf1**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Simply capturing the b2-pawn gives Black a winning position. But he also has a combinational option, which regains the exchange. Do you see it?

19.Rxf8?? gets the queen out but at the cost of a rook at the end of the variation after 19...Rxf8 20.Qg7 Rg8 21.Qh6 and White's queen, believing herself an heiress, is regrettably informed by her accountant that she is now officially a pauper as 21...Rg1+ picks off the a1-rook.

**19...Bg7!**

ANSWER: Double attack/discovered attack. --- "They have sown the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind," declares the bishop. White's queen, a sullen presence, can do nothing but endure the obnoxious bishop's sermon in silence.

**20.Qxg7 Rxg8 21.Qh6 Qxb2**

Black emerged two clean pawns up with the superior pawn structure and White can safely resign here.

**22.Re1**

Threat: Bxf5.

**22...Qc3! 23.Qh4**

23.Bxf5?? is met with the deflection shot 23...Rg1+! 24.Kxg1 Qxe1+ 25.Kg2 exf5 snagging a piece.

**23...c5 24.Rd1 c4 25.Bxf5**

Complete desperation. Recklessness is an exhaustible resource as the reckless side runs out of pieces to sac.

**25...Qxf3!**

Black's vivacious queen is the life and soul of the party. White's intermittent defenders can't be counted on anymore to keep their king safe.

Moro refuses to give White even vague cheapo hopes after 25...exf5 26.Qf4 .

**26.Qd4**

EXERCISE (combination alert): White threatens Qd6+, as well as Qc5+. How can Black end White's resistance? --- ANSWER: Overloading.

**26...Nd5**

26...Nd5 27.Be4 is met with the overloading shot 27...Ne3+! . The hungry carrion birds decide not to wait for the white king's death before dining on their first course - his liver. --- SUMMARY: Even though the move is played often, White should probably avoid the distracting 9 Qh6?! and go for 9 0-0-0, after which we enter a position with mutual chances.

0-1

### (54)Lutz, C.   --   Morozevich, A. 35: Biel  2010   0-1   C13 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 dxe4 5.Nxe4 Be7 6.Bxf6 gxf6 7.Nf3 a6 8.c4**

QUESTION: What is White's plan with this move? --- ANSWER: In previous games from this chapter, we have seen just how difficult it is for White to implement the d5-break. In those games, White attempted to do so exclusively with pieces. In this case, White decides that the break needs the help of his c-pawn. --- QUESTION: That sounds logical. What is Black to do about it? --- ANSWER: Not much. The d5-break is coming but Black gets the following compensation: 1. The c4-advance weakens White's dark squares. Moreover, the future d5 further weakens the c5- and e5-squares. This is serious since Black's unopposed dark-squared bishop increases in power. --- 2. In previous games of the chapter, one of White's main plusses is a developmental lead. In this case, c4 isn't a developing move and hence negates this advantage.

**8...f5**

Now that the d4-pawn has been weakened, Black immediately clears the f6-square for his bishop, increasing its scope dramatically.

**9.Nc3 Bf6 10.Qd2**

White backs up on the d4-pawn by clearing the d1-square for his rook. Once again, Qh6 remains in the periphery of White's contemplations.

**10...c5**

QUESTION: Doesn't this violate the principle: Avoid opening the position when behind in development? --- ANSWER: Very slightly so. But remember, in this line, White wasted a move on the non-developing c4, so Black is not as far behind as normal. Also, Black follows a principle: Open the game when you have the bishop pair. So the move is quite logical in this instance.

**11.d5**

White achieves his aim but it turns out that the impact on Black is not very significant.

However, 11.dxc5!? doesn't appear as logical to me. After 11...Qa5 12.g3 Nd7 13.c6!? bxc6 14.Bg2 Rb8 15.O-O c5 ( 15...Rxb2 isn't much of a combination since 16.Qxb2 Bxc3 17.Qc1 Bxa1 18.Qxa1 O-O looks equal ) 16.Rac1 O-O ( I would rather hang on to dark-square control than sell it for a pawn with 16...Bxc3?! 17.Rxc3 Qxa2 18.Rc2 when Black finds himself seriously weakened on the dark squares ) 17.b3 Bg7 18.Rfd1 Bb7 (the d7-pawn doesn't really hang if the c3-one is loose) 19.Qg5!? h6 20.Qe3 ( 20.Qe7?! Bc6 21.Na4 Rfd8 22.Ng5 hxg5 23.Bxc6 Bf6 24.Qd6 Ne5 25.Qxc5 Qxc5 26.Nxc5 Nxc6 27.Nd7 Nd4! and Black will remain up material, no matter how White responds ) 20...Rfd8 21.Na4 Bc6 , White found himself in trouble since he loses material, E.Kuniholm-C.Lakdawala, San Diego (rapid) 2010.

**11...O-O**

11...e5 is the alternative, giving White a protected passer but at the same time, activating the kingside pawn majority. After 12.h4 e4 13.Ng5 Qd6 14.O-O-O Nd7 15.Re1 , J.Lacasa Diaz-D.Stellwagen, Vlissingen 2005, the position feels a bit like a Sicilian Pelikan following 15...Kf8 16.Kb1 h6 17.Nh3 Ne5 .

**12.O-O-O**

Both sides plant seeds of the war by castling on opposite wings.

**12...Bg7**

Once again Black can opt for the Pelikan Sicilian-like position arising after 12...e5 13.h4 b5! . This kind of Benko Gambit sac isn't really much of a sac, since White would take on appalling risks to accept it and open queenside lines to his king. Hence, after 14.d6 (clearing d5 for his pieces) 14...Be6! , Black will have a winning position if he gets time for ...Nc6 and ...Nd4; ( the immediate 14...Nc6?! , A.Shirov-V.Topalov, Sarajevo 2000 and Black is in deep trouble after 15.d7! Bb7 16.Qd6! Bg7 17.h5 Nd4 18.h6 Qf6 19.Qxc5 Bxh6+ 20.Kb1 ) 15.Nd5 ( McDonald suggests the dangerous idea 15.g4! fxg4 16.Ng5 with a serious initiative and coming kingside attack for White ) 15...Bxd5! 16.Qxd5 Nd7 17.Nd2 Bg7 18.Rh3 Qf6 19.cxb5 , B.Belotti-T.Radjabov, Saint Vincent ITA 2001, Black can go for 19...e4 20.Rb3 axb5 21.Bxb5 Rxa2! 22.Bxd7 Rxb2 with insane complications, which Houdini, in its evaluating wisdom, rates at 0.00 - meaning, it's anybody's game.

**13.Kb1**

Threat: dxe6!, since Black no longer has the zwischenzug ...Qxd2+.

After 13.h4 exd5 ( McDonald suggests the crazy, line-opening 13...b5!? ) 14.Nxd5 Nc6 15.h5 h6 16.Rh3 f4 17.Rh4 , the f4-pawn is hanging and White stood slightly better and went on to win, A.Shirov-A.Morozevich, Astana 2001. Moro obviously laid in wait with a prepared improvement if Lutz had followed in Shirov's footsteps.

**13...exd5**

Of course Morozevich isn't going to fall for 13...b5?? 14.dxe6 Qxd2 when the check is no longer available. So, there is the zwischenzug after 15.exf7+ Rxf7 16.Rxd2 and White has an extra pawn, a developmental lead and the superior pawn structure, all adding up to a winning position.

**14.Nxd5**

This gives White a monster outpost on d5. However, it also allows Black to develop smoothly with ...Nc6.

The alternative is 14.cxd5 which allows Black to activate his queenside pawn majority. I'm not sure if White can do anything big with his d-pawn after 14...Nd7 15.Qc2 Nf6 16.d6 Ne8 17.Qd2 Be6 . I wouldn't mind taking on Black's game here. The d6-pawn seems to be under control and Black soon pushes forward his queenside pawn majority.

**14...Nc6 15.h4!**

The h5-h6 pawn thrust is in the air, as is Rh3.

I like this better than 15.Qf4 b5 16.Rd2 Nd4 17.Nxd4 cxd4 , S.Benderac-B.Kalezic, Cetinje 2010. Now perhaps White can speculate with 18.Rxd4!? Bxd4 19.Qxd4 Be6 20.g4 fxg4 21.h3 Bxd5 22.cxd5 f5 23.hxg4 . Once again, Houdini rates this at dead even after 23...Qf6 .

**15...b5!**

We arrive in a position of fractal randomness where calculation almost seems useless. Both sides realize there is no time to lose and strain to get at each other's king. The only calculation required in such a position is the thought "Go that direction".

**16.h5 h6**

Black can't allow White's pawn to reach h6.

**17.Rh3 f4 18.Qxf4!?**

White's mind is torn between the quest for glory and the need for prudence. "Tell prudence to shut the hell up!" says the 'quest for glory' part of his mind! It isn't easy to get through a chess game without harbouring at least one regret. For Lutz, this move may be the one. Technically, it may not even be a bad move. However, from a practical standpoint, his position looks a lot harder to play than Black's. This move is a bit like a sick person taking the correct medicine but not in the doctor's specified dosage. Lutz speculates, refusing to be swayed from his intentions by trifles like material and offers an exchange to fan his attack. When we lack data for mathematical certainties - or even probabilities - we humans tend to do the next best thing, by guessing. In such instances, we stop thinking like a logician or a mathematician. In fact, we stop thinking altogether and simply allow ourselves to dream the answer.

McDonald writes: "Because White has spent a tempo on 13 Kb1, things are very different to the Shirov game cited above as after 18.Rh4 , Black has a strong counter attack with 18...bxc4 19.Bxc4 Rb8 ". Houdini, just to be difficult, contradicts the human GM and rates at its favourite 0.00. Play may continue 20.b3 Ne5 21.Rxf4 Nxc4 22.Rxc4 Bf5+ 23.Kc1 and the engine continues to insist upon 0.00 even here. This may be even from a comp's standpoint, yet White's position looks harder to navigate over the board for us humans.

**18...Bxh3**

A blood initiation is required of the h3-rook, before he is accepted as a full-fledged member of the tribe.

**19.gxh3 Kh8 20.Rd2**

The alternatives favour Black too: After 20.Bd3?! bxc4 21.Bc2?? intending Qf5!, is foiled by 21...Rb8 ( 21...Qb8! also ruins it for White ) 22.Qf5 Rxb2+ 23.Kc1 Rxc2+ 24.Qxc2 c3 , White is hopelessly lost.

Following 20.cxb5 axb5 21.Bxb5 Nd4 22.Bc4 Nxf3 23.Qxf3 Rb8 24.b3 Qg5 Threat: ...Qe5. 25.Kc2 Qe5 26.Nc3 Rb6 27.Rd3 Rf6 28.Qe3 Qxh5 . I still slightly prefer Black.

**20...bxc4**

Moro hurries to open the b-file for his rook. Soon, the b2-weakness becomes a weight, dragging White down to the ocean floor.

**21.Bxc4 Rb8**

Houdini stubbornly claims the game is even. To my human eyes, Black's attack looks more dangerous. The open b-file and Black's play on the dark squares are more potent than White's domination of the light squares.

**22.a3?**

A natural attacker's spirit tends to revolt at the thought of enforced passivity. This weakens the light squares around White's king. Most importantly, it removes a b3 option and fixes the b2-pawn as a stationary target.

Houdini suggests 22.b3 when I still prefer Black's position.

**22...Na5 23.Ba2 Rb7!**

Dual purpose: 1. Black covers the f7-pawn if White intended Ne5. --- 2. Black contemplates ...Qb8, loading up on the b2-weakness.

**24.Qa4 Qc8! 25.Ne3**

Covering f5.

25.Qxa5 is met with 25...Rb5 26.Qa4 Qf5+ 27.Kc1 Qxf3 28.Qg4 Qh1+ winning.

**25...Rb5 26.Qe4 Qb8**

Black's forces continue to observe b2 with a dreamy eye. The black queen's unwelcome entry soon comes up like bile in the white king's throat.

**27.Nd1 Nb3 28.Bxb3 Rxb3 29.Ka2 c4!**

The pawn can't be touched since White's queen is required to cover the f3-knight.

**30.Nd4 Rd8 ! 31.Ka1**

EXERCISE (planning): Black's forces attach themselves to the white king's perimeter like a fungal infection. The attack looms, waxing formidably before White's nervous king, who is dragged by inevitability to places he doesn't want to visit. How did Morozevich force instant resignation?

31.Qg4 is met with the combination 31...Rxa3+! when White really can't accept, since 32.bxa3 ( 32.Kxa3 Rxd4 33.Rxd4 Qb3# ! ) 32...Bxd4 33.Qg3 Qb6 ensures White has no good answer to the coming ...Rb8.

**31...Rd3!**

. ANSWER: Removal of key defenders. In one swoop, Black clears away White's rook and d4-knight, after which his king is unable to stand the onslaught. --- The rook goes sightseeing, but in reality, the only sight which interests him is the sight of the white king's bloody corpse. White is busted and his king is denied life, liberty and also the pursuit of happiness.

After 31...Rd3! 32.Rxd3 cxd3 33.Nf5 Qb3 34.Qg4 Bf6 35.Nxh6 Rb8 , the black queen asked of her supporters "Shall we put him to death?" A hearty murmur of approval meets with her admirable proposal. Ever so merry a time was had by all present - well, except for White's doomed king, who strikes the lone dissonant note in an otherwise joyous gathering. White's attack has run aground while Black's has just begun. Both the a3- and b2-pawns hang, with devastating consequences for White. --- SUMMARY: After 8 c4, we reach ultra-sharp Sicilian Pelikan-like positions with opposite wing castling. Our queenside attacking chances, the bishop pair and control over the dark squares fully compensate us for White's d5-wedge and kingside attacking chances.

0-1

### (55)Polgar, J.   --   Morozevich, A. 36: Corus Tournament, Wijk aan Zee  2000   0-1   C13 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 dxe4 5.Nxe4 Be7 6.Bxf6 gxf6 7.Nf3 a6 8.g3**

QUESTION: Isn't this move out of place? White gave up his dark-squared bishop and then refuses to engage in a violent reaction, despite a developmental lead. --- ANSWER: This move earned a powerful pedigree when Kasparov used it to defeat Gurevich. It may actually be considered White's main line against the 6...gxf6 Burn Variation. White reasons that there is no urgency to blast open the position. After all, he did earn a concession for the bishop pair by damaging Black's pawn structure. So White proceeds strategically by fianchettoing and he prepares to castle kingside. --- QUESTION: But doesn't the fianchetto weaken the light squares? --- ANSWER: On the contrary, it actually provides improved security for White's king by taking away some of the glamour from the impending ...Rg8. Also, Black's coming b7-bishop tends to be one of the most powerful pieces on the board. So White meets it by challenging the h1-a8 diagonal.

**8...b5 9.Bg2 Bb7 10.Qe2**

A multipurpose move: 1. The queen protects the e4-knight. --- 2. The queen vacates the d-file to play either rook to d1 later on. --- 3. On e2, the queen eyes the b5-pawn and White can later play to loosen Black's queenside structure with a4.

**10...Nd7**

This non-committal developing move is probably best, where Black covers c5 and keeps White guessing how he will set up.

A look at a couple of options: 10...f5 11.Ned2 : ( 11...Bd5 12.O-O Nd7 13.c4 bxc4 14.Nxc4 c6 15.Ne3 was played in "JammyDodger"-C.Lakdawala, Internet (blitz) 2013 and White looks a shade better after 15...h5 16.Rac1 h4 17.Nxd5 cxd5 18.Rc6 a5 19.Rfc1 . ) ( 11...Nd7 12.O-O O-O 13.Rad1 ( 13.Rfd1 c5 14.Ne5 Bxg2 15.Kxg2 was B.Molnar-S.Drazic, Pula 2010. Black equalizes after 15...Qc7 16.Nxd7 Qxd7 17.dxc5 Qc6+ 18.Nf3 Qxc5 19.Rd2 Rad8 ) 13...Bd5 14.Rfe1 c6 , C.Lakdawala-"Cyclones", Internet (blitz) 2010. White holds a tiny edge after 15.c4 bxc4 16.Nxc4 Rb8 17.b3 intending Nfe5, when the c6-pawn looks weaker than the one on d4. )

10...Bd5 11.Ned2 Nd7 12.O-O c5?! and Black has opened the game prematurely. He should castle and leave ...c6 options open. After 13.dxc5 Nxc5 14.Rfd1 Qc7 15.c4 bxc4 16.Nxc4 Rd8 17.Rac1 , Black, already in serious trouble, blundered with 17...Qb7? , P.Leko-A.Morozevich, Moscow 2007. White missed 18.Rxd5! exd5 ( 18...Qxd5 19.Nfe5 Qd4 20.Bc6+ Kf8 21.Qh5! fxe5 22.Nxe5 and Black is forced to give up the queen to stave off mate ) 19.Nd4 and Black, although up an exchange is busted strategically, with his wrecked structure and White's knights on the rampage.

**11.O-O O-O 12.Rad1**

White's main move but not the best one, since this may be a case of the wrong rook.

Kasparov correctly played 12.Rfd1! , leaving the a1-rook where it is for now. White can play for either a4 or c4. The game continued 12...Bd5 13.c3 f5 14.Ned2 when Black played the dubious 14...c5?! which violates the principle: Don't open the position when behind in development. ( . After 14...c5?! 15.dxc5 Nxc5 16.Nf1 Qc7 17.Rxd5! exd5 18.Ne3 Bf6 , G.Kasparov-M.Gurevich, Sarajevo 2000, White should continue 19.Nxd5 Qd6 20.Nd4 . For an exchange, White gets a pawn and monstrous activity for his d5-knight. Moreover the f5-pawn is weak and so is Black's king. Advantage White. This game is annotated in A Ferocious Opening Repertoire. ) ( . QUESTION: Since Gurevich got into trouble with 14...c5?!, what would you suggest as an improvement in Black's play? --- ANSWER: Let's look at our options: 14...c6?! is met with 15.b3 intending c4, when White stands better. ) ( . Stronger is 14...Rb8! and if White prepares c4 with 15.b3 , Black gets a much better version than the Kasparov-Gurevich game with 15...c5! 16.c4 bxc4 17.bxc4 ( 17.Nxc4?! Bf6! 18.Rac1 Bxf3 19.Qxf3 Bxd4 and I don't believe in White's full compensation for the pawn ) 17...Bc6 18.Nb3 Bf6 19.Rac1 Ba4 20.d5 Qe7 21.Rd3 e5 22.d6 Qe6 23.Nfd2 Bg5 with a messy position where Black looks okay to me. Houdini gives White a tiny edge here. )

**12...Bd5**

This central light-square blockade is a typical plan for Black, who can back up the d5-bishop with ...c6.

**13.Rfe1**

13.b3 can be met with 13...b4 14.c4 bxc3 15.Nxc3 c6 . Houdini favours White, while I think Black looks solid.

**13...Kh8 14.Nfd2**

This is the point where theory ends and White plans c4 next.

Following 14.Ned2 c6 15.b3 b4 16.Nc4 Nb6 17.Nfd2 , M.Senff-Huang Qian, Moscow 2006, it feels like Black equalized. Play may proceed 17...Nxc4 18.Nxc4 Rg8 19.Ne3 Ra7 20.f4 f5 with approximately even chances.

**14...c6 15.c4 bxc4 16.Nxc4 a5**

In order to play a future ...Nb6 without allowing Na5.

**17.Nc3 Re8**

This looks like a waste of time. I don't understand the motivation behind this move since Black's rook usually heads for g8 in such positions.

I would play the immediate 17...f5 .

**18.Ne3 f5 19.Nc4 Qb8**

Taking aim at key squares g3, f4, b2 and b4.

**20.Na4!?**

Polgar fishes around for a plan and decentralizes her knight. I'm not really sure it's necessary to suppress ...c5, since there is no way Black can engineer that move without serious negative consequences.

20.Rc1 looks better but what next? I don't see an active plan for White. Black, if he is ambitious, can slowly build on the kingside, starting with ...Rg8 and following up with ...f5. I already prefer Black's game here.

**20...Qb4 21.b3 Bf6 22.Qc2 Rg8!**

When neither side takes action or shows ambition, always remember - 50% of the silence belongs to you. It's a door which either party may open, yet sometimes both choose not to. At last, Morozevich gets ambitious and initiates the correct plan. Since the queenside remains in a state of semi-stasis, Morozevich gradually begins to tunnel away at g3 to get at Polgar's king.

**23.Qc1 Rg4**

Worrying White about the d4-pawn, while preparing to double rooks on the g-file.

**24.Ne5 Nxe5 25.dxe5 Be7 26.Rd3 Rag8 27.Red1**

QUESTION: This looks aimless. Why doesn't White bring her offside knight back into the game with 27.Nc3 ? --- ANSWER: It does feel as if the worthless knight is the kind of person Shakespeare described as a "fat and greasy citizen". White is at a loss for a reasonable defensive plan. The trouble is the knight, as awfully posted as it is, may be required where it sits. Polgar probably feared losing control over c5. Black can crank up the pressure with 27...Bc5 . "I am the perfect instrument for good in an imperfect world," proclaims the conceited bishop who is now given permission to perch on c5, due to the knight's absence on a4. After 28.Nxd5 cxd5 , ...f4 is coming and the opposite-coloured bishops favour the attacker, in this case Black. In any case, there is little diminution in the misery level of the soon-to-be oppressed white king.

**27...f4 28.Qc3**

Polgar would rather risk a bad ending over a bad middlegame.

**28...fxg3 29.hxg3 h5!**

The excavation project continues. Suddenly, the g3-rock doesn't look so stable anymore.

**30.Bxd5 cxd5 31.Rf3 Kg7 32.Qc7?**

As we review the post-mortem of a game we threw away with a blunder or an insane notion, there generally is a select move which juts out in memory and makes us wince. The queen's abandonment of her defensive post has the effect of a bugle burst on the battlefield, rallying Black's attackers. When oblique plans fail to function, we tend to veer towards the blunt versions. With the stroke of a single move, a once-difficult position becomes indistinguishable from a losing one.

Polgar overestimates her attacking chances while vastly underestimating Morozevich's. She undoubtedly feared she would eventually lose the ending after 32.Qxb4 axb4 . Black's advantages: 1. The e5-pawn is a target. --- 2. So is the a2-pawn. --- 3. Black's bishop is superior to White's knight. --- 4. The undermining ...h4 still hovers over White. Still, it is better to endure a worse ending than to allow the opponent a wicked attack - doubly so when Morozevich is the attacker.

**32...h4**

Moro continues to dig away at g3. White feels the pressure at virtually every interface and contact point with enemy forces.

**33.Kg2 hxg3 34.fxg3**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Prove that Black's attack is far more potent than White's. --- ANSWER: Pin/double attack.

**34...Qe4!**

Black threatens a devastating check on e2. Black's queen ruins it for White's defenders, the way an adult sometimes bullies her way into a children's game and insists on playing, even when she's clearly unwelcome. Now comes the uncomfortable silence which tends to follow a formal introduction.

**35.Qc3**

The queen is the prodigal daughter, whose return isn't celebrated by the rest of her family. She realizes her king is about to perish and slips her hand into his, as a silent goodbye.

Polgar's last move appears to be a double question mark, hanging a rook, obviously the effect of extreme time pressure, but not really, since nothing works anyway. For example: 35.Qxe7 Qe2+ 36.Kh3 Qxf3 37.Qf6+ Qxf6 38.exf6+ Kxf6 and White has no chance in the ending.

35.Rf1 Rxg3+! 36.Kxg3 Qh4+ 37.Kg2 Kh6+ forces mate in two.

**35...Qe2+ 36.Kh3**

White's king, by now consumed by shame, must dance an undignified jig, all for the black queen's perverse pleasure. He decries the fact that he is the only giver in a society of takers, and gets an uncomfortable feeling that he is the object of a secret jest of everyone in the room. --- EXERCISE (combination alert): We can simply grab a free rook on d1 (I'm ashamed to say this is what your greedy writer would probably play without hesitation). --- But forcing mate is so much better, isn't it? To paraphrase Lasker, we French Defence players are artists, not butchers. Try and find a forced mate in five moves. How did Morozevich reveal all which was once unexplained? --- ANSWER: Black's rook pulls off the trick, the way a magician conjures a rabbit from nothingness. There is no answer to a devastating check on h8.

**36...Rg5!**

. Refusing the d1-gift is an emanation of the black queen's contempt for White's king, who screams, "Mark my words: you will live to regret this outrage! I will unleash the forces of hell upon..." The king's tirade is interrupted by the black queen's loud, cavernous yawn.

ANSWER #2: 36...Re4! also gets the job done.

ANSWER #3: Likewise 36...Rg6! works as well.

SUMMARY: The strategic 8.g3 (in conjunction with Kasparov's more accurate 12.Rfd1!) is currently White's most popular choice against our 6...gxf6 Burn line. Remember our key manoeuvre: ...Bd5 followed by ...c6, with an iron central light square wall on d5. If White follows with Kasparov's 12.Rfd1, be ready to meet it with Houdini's novelty 14...Rb8! when Black may be able to pull off a much better version of the Kasparov-Gurevich encounter.<skip/>

### (56)6: McCutcheon Main Line   --   ? ? ????   \* (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.e5 h6 6.Bd2 Bxc3**

. In this chapter, we choose to enter one of the most complicated lines of the book. In the McCutcheon, we observe a clear demarcation: The e5-pawn insures that the kingside is White's playground, while we as Black, must generate counterplay in the centre and on the queenside. To top it off, as in the above diagram, we voluntarily saddle ourselves with weak kingside dark squares and nurse them fearfully. But there is good news for us as well. It is not only our side who takes liberties with the pawn structure. Unlike the Winawer, in the main line McCutcheon, we soon eliminate White's monster dark-squared bishop. On top of that, we lure our opponent's king to d2, where it will never feel safe after our ...c5 and ...Qa5 ideas.

7.bxc3 Ne4 8.Qg4 g6

8...Kf8 . As the positions shows, we enter battle between the irresistible force versus the immovable object. We swap one problem for another by defending g7 with ...Kf8, rather than the structurally weakening...g6. This keeps our dark squares intact at the following costs:

1. Loss of castling privileges.
2. We risk that our h8-rook may be out of play for quite a while.
3. Our stationary king provides White with a somewhat fixed attacking target. However, we also have access to a curious plan of ...c5 and ...c4, after which we seal the queenside and then run our king (who does his best imitation of a shuttlecock in a badminton match) there after securing our kingside pawns.

In both positions, White's attackers and our counterpunchers pour forth simultaneously, like an insect infestation in this bug-eat-bug world. The positions are very easy to misplay by an underprepared opponent. Through intense study of this chapter, we hone our skills and decide to take on Black's side. We may see our opponents reach dizzying heights of futility in their attempts to storm our not-so-easy-to-mate king. 7.Bxc3 We will also look at the sensible-looking bishop recapture after 6...Nxc3, which keeps White's pawn structure undamaged, but is ultimately too insipid a concept to be a threat to Black's counterattack on the queenside.<skip start="6...Nxc3"/>

### (57)Anand, V.   --   Shirov, A. 37: Bilbao Grand Slam, Spain  2010   1/2-1/2   C12 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6**

When are people going to understand that the French Defence is a sub-par choice against Anand!?

**2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6**

Compare the position we get in the McCutcheon with this one in the Winawer French after 3...Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Ne7 7.Qg4 . In this version, White gets to hang on to his powerful dark-squared bishop, but Black's kingside remains undamaged.

**4.Bg5**

We will cover 4.exd5 in the last chapter of the book.

**4...Bb4**

This move is our gateway to the McCutcheon, one of the most perplexing (for both sides) lines of the French.

**5.e5**

White thematically grabs space and attacks the pinned f6-knight.

White has the lame alternatives: 5.Bd3?! c5 ( this is more ambitious than 5...dxe4 6.Bxe4 Nbd7 7.Bf3 h6 with equality, since White wasted too much time with his light-squared bishop, N.Padevsky-T.Petrosian, Munich 1958 ) 6.e5 and now Houdini recommends the crazy 6...cxd4 7.exf6 dxc3!! 8.fxg7 cxb2+ 9.Kf1 when optically, it appears as if Black is losing, but those wonderful/hateful comps came up with the amazing 9...Bc3 ! 10.gxh8=R+ Bxh8 11.Rb1 Qxg5 . Antic and Maksimovic in The Modern French claim a black edge at this point, and I agree. That b2-pawn chokes White.

5.a3?! Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 dxe4 7.f3 is an attempt to get some kind of hybrid Blackmar-Diemer Gambit but we don't have to cooperate and take the f3-pawn. With 7...Qd5! 8.Qd2 , E.Tripolsky-V.Ivanov, correspondence 1993, I don't see any compensation for the pawn after 8...Nbd7 .

5.Bxf6?! Qxf6 and we thank White for the bishop pair! 6.e5 Qd8 (leaving e7 open as a retreat square for the bishop) 7.a3 and Black retreats the bishop with 7...Be7 , M.Ahmed Holi Ali-S.Sadek, Cairo 2013. I like keeping control over the dark squares better than exchanging on c3. Black already stands slightly better, since White has no compensation for the loss of the bishop pair and dark-square control.

We will look at offshoots lines 5.exd5 Qxd5

and 5.Ne2 in the final chapter of the book.

**5...h6**

We have no choice but to break White's pin.

**6.Bd2**

The main line.

In the next chapter, we will look at 6.Be3

6.Bc1

and in the final chapter we examine 6.exf6

and 6.Bh4 .

**6...Bxc3 7.bxc3**

We will cover 7.Bxc3 in Grund-Kobalia (Game 45).

**7...Ne4 8.Qg4**

White forces a concession.

QUESTION: Can White play 8.Bd3 Nxd2 9.Qxd2 to preserve White's right to castle? --- ANSWER: Doing so places the queen on a far less powerful square than g4. Black equalizes after 9...c5 10.Nf3 c4 though retaining the central tension is also fine for Black. After 11.Be2 Nc6 12.h4 Bd7 13.h5 f6 14.Nh4 fxe5 15.Ng6 Rg8 16.dxe5 , R.Moor-R.Huebner, Switzerland 2001, I would challenge the intruder with 16...Ne7 with a dynamically balanced game, where I prefer Black's structure over White's space.

**8...g6**

Black agrees to weaken the dark squares around his kingside to preserve castling privileges.

We examine 8...Kf8 later in the chapter.

**9.Bd3**

Note that the 9.h4 move order shouldn't alter anything. We transpose after 9...c5 10.Bd3 Nxd2 11.Kxd2 .

White can offer a pawn to retain the services of the powerful dark-squared bishop with 9.Bc1!? c5 ( 9...Nxc3 10.Bd3 c5 11.dxc5 Qa5 transposes ) 10.Bd3 Nxc3 11.dxc5 Qa5 12.Bd2 Qa4! : ( . Black stands better in the ending after 13.Qxa4+?! Nxa4 14.Bb5+ Bd7 15.Bxa4 Bxa4 16.Rb1 b6! 17.cxb6 axb6 and if 18.Rxb6 Bxc2 19.Rb2 Bd3 with a clear advantage, since White is behind in development and the a2-pawn is under pressure. ) ( 13.h3 Ne4 14.Bxe4 h5 ( 14...Qd4 15.Rb1 Qxe5 16.Ne2 Qxe4 17.Qxe4 dxe4 18.Nc3 f5 19.Nb5 Na6 with White's developmental lead, open b-file and dark-square control compensating him for the lost pawn and inferior structure, A.Lanc-C.Williams, correspondence 2009 ) 15.Qf4 Qxe4+ , D.Petrosian -A.Minasian, Yerevan 2011. Chances look balanced after 16.Qxe4 dxe4 17.Ne2 Bd7 18.Rb1 Bc6 19.Nd4 O-O 20.Nxc6 Nxc6 21.Rxb7 Rab8 22.Rb3 Rbc8 . It will be a contest of dark squares versus better pawn structure. )

**9...Nxd2**

I once toyed with the offbeat but slightly dubious 9...Bd7?! in the early 90's, mainly to throw opponents off their theoretical stride. After 10.Bxe4 dxe4 11.Ne2! ( Black's idea comes to fruition if White bites with 11.Qxe4 Bc6 12.Qg4 Qd5 13.f3 Nd7 and Black gets loads of light-squared play for the pawn, R.Aeria-C.Lakdawala, San Diego 1992 ) 11...Bc6 12.Ng3 Qd5 13.Nf1! Nd7 14.Ne3 Qb5 15.a4 Qa6 16.c4 , it feels like Black is getting squeezed on the queenside, E.Relange-A.Kaminik, Paris 1998.

**10.Kxd2**

Compare this position to the Winawer French. The structure may be similar, but in the case of the McCutcheon, Black owns one gigantic plus: White doesn't retain his monster dark-squared bishop, as in the Winawer.

**10...c5 11.h4**

This move, intended to create undermining with h5, is played almost as often as 11.Nf3 and the two lines often transpose. --- QUESTION: What is the difference between the two moves? --- ANSWER: 11 h4 keeps White's f-pawn free. This can make a difference in the lines if later White plays h5 and when Black responds with ...g5. White has an option to undermine further with f4, which he can't do so with a knight on f3. Also, with 11 h4, White has Rh3-f3 options which again isn't possible if White develops his knight early to f3.

**11...Qa5**

One idea of this move order is to avoid committing the b8-knight early to retain d7 possibilities.

11...Nc6 is more common and the lines generally transpose: ( 12.Nf3 cxd4 ( 12...Qa5 transposes ) 13.cxd4 Qa5+ and Black's intention is to play ...b6,...Ba6, ...Bxd3, swapping away White's best attacker/defender and then stirring up counterplay on the c-file. This plan is similar to the Vallejo Pons game we will look at later in the chapter, the only difference being ...g6 and ...Kf8 are substituted. After 14.Ke2 b6! 15.Qf4 Ba6 16.Rhc1 Qa3 17.Qe3 Rc8 18.Kf1 Bxd3+ 19.cxd3 , M.Feygin-T.Gharamian, Belgium 2008, Black is virtually up a pawn, with a healthy queenside majority, while White's extra on the kingside is virtually useless. Houdini rates this at even. I don't believe White's kingside space and dark- square control fully make up for his structural vices. ) ( 12.Qf4 cxd4 We closely examine this idea later in the chapter. 13.cxd4 Qa5+ 14.Ke3 b6 15.h5 gxh5 16.Ne2 Ba6 17.Bxa6 Qxa6 18.c3 Rc8 19.f3 Rg8 20.g3 Rg5 21.Kf2 Ne7 22.Qe3 Kd7 23.f4 Rg6 24.Rxh5 Rcg8 and Black stands better. White is pinned down to both the g3- and a2-pawns, and ...Nf5 is coming, E.Van den Doel-I.Glek, Zwolle 2002. )

11...Bd7!? : QUESTION: This move looks unnatural. What is Black's idea? --- ANSWER: Black intends ...Bc6, ...Nd7 and ...Qe7, covering weak points on b7 and f6. ( . Fischer, in My 60 Memorable Games said " 12.dxc5 deserves testing." Well, here is the test result: 12...Qe7 13.Rb1 Bc6 14.Nf3 Nd7 15.Qf4 Nxc5 16.Nd4 Rc8 17.f3 a6 18.Rb4 , I.Cselotei-J.Bali, Hungary 2006. I don't really see White's compensation for the damaged structure after 18...b5 . ) ( 12.h5 g5 13.f4 . Here we see the benefits of holding back on Nf3. White is able to further undermine Black's structure. Following 13...Nc6 14.fxg5 Qa5! 15.dxc5 d4 16.Nf3 O-O-O ( the immediate 16...Qxc3+ followed by castling long may be more accurate ) 17.Rab1 , Houdini rates this completely chaotic situation at even, P.Leko-T. Radjabov, Linares 2003. ( White can also try 17.Nxd4!? Nxe5 18.Qe4 Qxc5 19.Rab1 Bc6 20.Nxc6 Nxc6 21.g6 when Houdini prefers White's position. From a human perspective, the game looks unclear to me with Black having attacking compensation for the pawn. ) )

**12.Nf3 Nc6**

Applying pressure to the d4-pawn.

**13.Qf4**

White ignores the threat. White's queen has her eye on f6 and the kingside dark squares.

The text move is far more dynamic than the milquetoast 13.dxc5 Qxc5 14.Rhf1 Bd7 when I already prefer Black's position since he is ready to pile on pressure down the c-file with ...Rc8, S.Pozo Vera-J.Guia Garcia, Santa Clara 2003.

**13...cxd4 14.h5!?**

Risky and ambitious. One comes to expect such breaches of decorum from Anand.

In the next game, we will look at the calmer 14.Nxd4 .

**14...g5!?**

The alternatives: 14...dxc3+ 15.Ke2 : ( . I don't like giving White a passed h-pawn after 15...g5 16.Qf6 Rg8 17.Qxh6 although Black looks fine here after 17...g4 18.Ng5 (transposing to a variation examined in the notes to Black's 15th move) 18...Nxe5 19.Qf6 , White threatens Black's knight, as well as h6-h7-h8 promoting the pawn. Black has 19...Qd8! 20.Qxe5 Qxg5 21.Qxc3 Bd7 22.h6 e5 , M.Frangi-V.Turkov, correspondence 2002. I don't think Black stands worse. His monster centre easily makes up for White's passed h-pawn. ) ( . Black can also remove the threat of White's potential passed h-pawn with 15...gxh5!? 16.Rxh5 Qb4! 17.Qf6 Rf8 18.Rxh6 Qe7 19.Rh8 , I.Brunsek-L.Devocelle, correspondence 2002. The position looks balanced after 19...Rxh8 20.Qxh8+ Kd7 21.Rh1 b6 22.Rh7 Bb7 23.Qg7 Rf8 24.Ng5 Nd8 . ( ) )

14...Qxc3+ may be all right, risky though it seems after 15.Ke2 gxh5 16.Rab1 b6 17.Rxh5 , L.Henris-M.Scacco, correspondence 2002. The position is incredibly sharp and perhaps Black can continue with 17...Qa3 18.Rxh6 Rxh6 19.Qxh6 Qxa2 20.Rc1! ( 20.Rh1?? is met powerfully with 20...Ba6! threatening to chop the c2-pawn next ) 20...Bb7 21.Qg7 Rc8 22.Rh1 Ba6 23.Rh8+ Kd7 24.Qxf7+ Ne7 25.Rxc8 Bxd3+ 26.Kd2 ( 26.Kxd3 is met with 26...Qa6+ ) 26...Qa5+ 27.c3 Qa2+ 28.Kxd3 Qa6+ 29.Kc2 Qa2+ with perpetual check. ( Black should probably avoid 29...Qxc8 30.Nxd4 Qg8 31.Qxg8 Nxg8 although Houdini rates it at dead even as well. )

**15.Qf6 Rf8!?**

Watson calls this move "passive" and I think he is correct. The move may be playable but somehow the vitality of Black's defences feel as if they have receded. --- QUESTION: Why not play the more aggressive 15...Rg8? --- ANSWER: Shirov may have been deterred by the tempo gain when White pushes his passed pawn to h7 if Black's rook is posted on g8.

Indeed, 15...Rg8! is risky but probably still Black's best move: ( 16.Ke2 dxc3 17.Qxh6 g4 18.Ng5 Nxe5 19.Qf6 ( a perplexing continuation is 19.Nh7 Bd7 20.Nf6+ Ke7 21.Qf4 Nxd3 22.Nxg8+ Rxg8 23.cxd3 Qa4 24.Qxa4 Bxa4 and I have no idea who stands better here! Houdini rates at even. Black has two pawns for the exchange and each side enjoys a deeply entrenched passer ) 19...Qd8 20.Qxe5 Qxg5 21.Qxc3 and we transpose back to the Frangi-Turkov game where chances look even. Here my suggestion is 21...Qh6 . ) ( . After 16.Qxh6 , Black must be careful as 16...g4? runs into 17.Nxd4! Nxd4 18.Qf6 Bd7 19.h6 Rc8 20.h7 Qxc3+ 21.Ke3 Nxc2+ 22.Kf4 Qd4+ 23.Kg3 Qxd3+ when White is completely winning due to his advanced h-pawn despite being two pieces down with his king on the run. Following 24.f3! Qxh7 (no choice!) 25.Rxh7 gxf3+ 26.Kxf3 Rc3+ 27.Kf2 Rf8 28.Rah1 , Black resigned, G.Goncharenko-J. Heesen, correspondence 2008. )

**16.Qxh6 g4 17.Ng5 Nxe5 18.Nh7**

The knight spirals giddily heavenward to his target. As we can see, there are issues with posting the rook on f8 as well!

**18...Rh8?**

The position remained in a state of flux - until now. After this move Black finds himself in serious danger. Shirov loses his grip on the position's essence, allowing himself to get distracted.

Black can just barely keep the balance with: 18...Qxc3+! 19.Ke2 Nxd3! 20.Qxf8+ ( 20.cxd3? Qb2+! favours Black ) 20...Kd7 21.Qxf7+ Kd6 22.Rhb1! ( 22.cxd3?? is met with the crushing 22...Qb2+ ) 22...Qxc2+ 23.Kf1 b6 24.Ng5 and White intends to push his h-pawn forward. After 24...Qd2 25.Qf6 Qf4! 26.Nf7+ ( 26.Qxf4+? Nxf4 gives Black too many pawns for the exchange ) 26...Kd7 27.Qd8+ Kc6 28.Qe8+ Kc7 29.Qd8+ , the game is drawn.

18...dxc3+? loses after 19.Ke2 Qc5 20.Nxf8 Qxf8 21.Qf6 and Black resigned, A.Delorme-T.Flachet, Nantes 2006.

**19.Ke2! Nxd3 20.cxd3 Bd7!**

In a chess game, it isn't reasonable to believe you will foresee every potential outcome. Instead, the key is to adapt efficiently to rapid alterations in circumstances, as Shirov displays here.

The tempting 20...Qxc3? loses quickly to 21.Rhc1 Qb2+ 22.Kf1 . Black soon loses the exchange and even worse, must then deal with White's passed h-pawn.

**21.Nf6+ Ke7 22.Qg5**

To survive, Black faces three separate knots to untangle: 1. The most obvious: King safety. --- 2. Black, in most lines will emerge an exchange for a pawn down. --- 3. Black must deal with White's dangerous passed h-pawn in all endings and some middlegames.

**22...dxc3!**

Calmly allowing a truckload of discoveries.

**23.Ne4+**

White's second best move.

Let's look at other choices: 23.Nxd5+? Kd6 24.Qe7+ Kxd5 25.Qxd7+ Ke5 and strangely enough, Black is fine.

23.h6! is the most exact line, which augments White's already considerable resources. 23...Bb5 24.a4 Ba6 ( 24...Bxd3+ 25.Kxd3 Qa6+ 26.Ke3 Qb6+ 27.Ke2 Qb2+ 28.Kd3 and Black runs out of checks ) 25.Nxd5+ Kd6 26.Qe7+! and this time, the king chase works for White. Dozens of goblin eyes peer malevolently at Black's king, whose existence is permeated with a seemingly endless series of crisis of varying intensity. The hunt is on with 26...Kxd5 27.Qd7+ Kc5 28.Rh5+ f5 29.Rxf5+! and the rook does little to assuage the black king's already bruised ego. With 29...exf5 30.Qxf5+ , the power mad queen's dream to keep her enemy in her thrall, finally comes to fruition. "It gladdens my heart that you will not outlive your infamy," she informs Black's fugitive king and wraps things up with 30...Kb6 31.Rb1+ and Black drops his queen.

**23...Ke8 24.Nf6+ Ke7 25.Nxg4+**

Still winning,

but 25.h6! transposes to the winning note from above.

**25...Kd6 26.Ne5?!**

EXERCISE (combination alert): This looks crushing but isn't. White's all-powerful queen and knight gaze in distaste upon Black's grimy masses, above their bustle, clamour and strife. Sometimes we must find a defensive combination. The once-scattered threats congeal into a dual, existential crisis, as potential combinations flutter about to and fro. White threatens both Nc4+ and Nxf7+ and a rudimentary glance seems to tell us Black has no defence. But...he does! What did Shirov find to keep himself afloat?

26.Qe5+! retains White's advantage.

**26...f6!**

ANSWER: Black may still be losing after this move, but it is the only one which keeps him afloat.

**27.Qxf6 Raf8!**

Sometimes compliance to our opponent's wishes serves our interests better than open resistance.

**28.Qg7?**

Why is it that when we work out a plan which looks 99% sound, that annoying 1% always seems to rear its ugly head? In situations of mutual confusion, where we feel we reached the summit of inanity, another mistake often follows, topping the rest. Anand's ardour for the attack refuses to cool. He falters in the head-spinning complications.

He should cash out with 28.Nf7+! Rxf7 29.Qxf7 Qa4 30.Kf1 c2 31.Qf3 Qb4 32.Ke2 Bb5 33.h6 and White should win since the h-pawn ties Black down.

**28...Qa4?!**

28...Qb6! is correct. After 29.Nf7+ ( 29.Qxd7+? Kxe5 and it is Black who may be winning. Black's king plays dumb, but White's queen isn't so dumb as to believe his act ) 29...Rxf7 30.Qxf7 Qb2+ 31.Kf3 Qb5 32.Rad1 c2 33.Qf4+ Ke7 34.Qg5+ Kd6 35.Qf4+ , it is perpetual check.

**29.Nf7+?!**

If Anand and Shirov commit mistakes on almost every move, imagine us here!

29.Qg3! is White's last try when 29...Qc2+ 30.Kf1 Rxf2+! 31.Qxf2 Qxf2+ 32.Kxf2 Kxe5 33.Rae1+! Kd4 34.Ke2! Ke5 35.h6 d4 36.Rh5+ Kd6 37.g4 won't be easy for White to convert but my feeling is that he should be able to pull off a win.

**29...Rxf7 30.Qxf7 Qc2+ 31.Kf1 Qxd3+ 32.Kg1 Qd2 33.Qg7 c2!**

Forcing the draw.

Black can play for a win but also risks losing also after 33...Rc8 34.h6 c2 35.Qg3+ e5 36.Qa3+ Ke6 37.Qc1 Qxc1+! ( 37...Qc3? 38.h7 Qxa1 39.Rh6+! Ke7 40.Qxa1 c1=Q+ 41.Qxc1 Rxc1+ 42.Kh2 Rc8 43.h8=Q Rxh8 44.Rxh8 and White stands better due to his passed g-pawn ) 38.Rxc1 d4 39.Kf1 d3 40.Ke1 Kf6 41.Kd2 Bf5 42.f3 Bh7 and Houdini rates the ending at dead even.

**34.Qxh8 c1=Q+**

Time, which White doesn't have on his side, slips away. The win is gone.

**35.Rxc1 Qxc1+**

Now Black's queen spreads discomfort to White's king, like marmalade on toast.

**36.Kh2 Qf4+**

The game ends in perpetual check.

**37.Kg1 Qc1+**

Black's queen is clearly besotted with the white king.

**38.Kh2**

. SUMMARY: If you revel in irrational positions, then the 8...g6 McCutcheon lines are for you. 15...Rg8! may be an improvement over Shirov's choice of 15...Rf8.<level start="8...g6"/>

1/2-1/2

### (58)Nyysti, S.   --   Glek, I. 38: Heart of Finland Open, Helsinki  2002   0-1   C12 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.e5 h6 6.Bd2 Bxc3 7.bxc3 Ne4 8.Qg4 g6**

It's best to view this line from the lens of a natural defender and counterattacker. With each sacrifice (yes...deliberate damage to one's own structure is certainly a kind of sacrifice) comes the weighing of virtue and sin. Black once again decides to weaken kingside dark squares in exchange for the right to castle.

**9.Bd3 Nxd2 10.Kxd2 c5 11.h4 Qa5**

QUESTION: What is the difference between 11...Qa5 and the more common 11...Nc6? --- ANSWER: Not much since they tend to transpose. Still there can be differences. When Black leaves the queen on d8, it continues to cover the sensitive f6-square. When Black plays 11...Nc6, we lose options of plans involving ...Bd7, ...Bc6 and ...Nd7.

**12.Nf3**

QUESTION: Are there benefits to holding back Nf3? --- ANSWER: 12 Nf3 develops a piece and adds coverage to d4. It does however, block White from ideas like pushing f4 or a rook-lift to f3.

Instead, after 12.Rh3 Nc6 13.Bxg6 , the position looks terribly dangerous for Black, but this is mere appearance. Black has the strong 13...Nxd4! ( of course, we must avoid the boneheaded blunder 13...Rg8?? 14.Bxf7+ Kxf7 15.Rf3+ winning ) 14.Kd1 Rg8! 15.Bxf7+ Kxf7 (notice that White doesn't have access to Rf3+) 16.Qh5+ Ke7 17.cxd4 Rxg2 18.Ne2 Bd7 19.Qxh6?? ( 19.Qf3 is necessary, when 19...Rag8 20.Rg3 R2xg3 21.fxg3 Rf8 22.Nf4 Rf5 is still better for Black, who holds the initiative ) 19...Rf8 , W.Spoelman-I.Glek, Hoogeveen 2003. White can resign here since 20.f4 is met with 20...Bb5 .

**12...Nc6 13.Qf4 cxd4 14.Nxd4**

The text move is safer than Anand's 14.h5 , as we have seen in the previous game. The trouble is the move may be a bit too safe and it feels like Black equalizes without too many worries.

**14...Nxd4**

Exchanges, in general, help Black since he owns the less damaged pawn structure and White's opportunities to attack have been reduced.

**15.Qxd4 Bd7**

I think Black has equalized. He has the superior pawn structure and coming pressure down the c-file. These, however, are offset by White's space plus the h5 and f4 (after Black responds to h5 with ...g5) undermining possibilities.

**16.Rhb1**

Other options: 16.Rab1 b6 17.Qb4 Qa4 ( I see no reason to fix White's structure and hand him the slightly superior ending after 17...Qxb4 18.cxb4 . While the position may be quite drawable for Black, I can only envision White winning, due to the extra space, L.Brunner-I.Glek, Germany 1991 ) 18.Qxa4 Bxa4 gives equal chances in the ending, D.Burkhanov-D.Aupov, Cherepovets 2001.

16.h5 g5 17.Rab1 Bc6 18.Rhf1 O-O-O 19.f4 gxf4 20.Rxf4 Rdg8 21.g4 Rg7 22.Rbf1 , F.Titzhoff-A.Anreiter, correspondence 2009, gives dynamically balanced chances after 22...Be8 .

**16...Qc7 17.a4 Bc6 18.Rb4**

Maybe White should toss in 18.a5 to prevent Black from playing ...a5. --- QUESTION: Doesn't White stand better? After all, he owns more space and has the superior bishop. --- ANSWER: It feels to me that White stands better only on paper. In reality, Black's nearly weakness-free position is very solid and he or she should be equal or very close to it, despite White's extra space and superior bishop.

**18...Qe7**

Black can speculate with 18...a5 !? 19.Rb6 O-O . In this line our king often takes on the air of an honest man, wrongfully accused of a heinous crime. After 20.h5 Qd8! 21.hxg6 fxg6 22.f4 Qh4 23.Rf1 Qg4 24.g3 Kg7 ( 24...Qxg3?! is met with 25.Bxg6! ) 25.Qe3 Rac8 , it's difficult to decide which king is less secure. Chances may be even.

**19.Rab1 a5!?**

Okay, he heard my suggestion. This aggressive reaction weakens a few squares, like b6 and b5 but it also fixes White's a-pawn on a4 as a potential future target. Black must now be on alert for Bb5 ideas.

**20.Rb6 Rc8 21.Ba6!?**

This move seems more clever than strong. The bishop, who trained tirelessly all his life for his final ascent to heaven, ironically ends up here, so far from paradise. He intrudes jarringly upon the once smooth proceedings. This isn't a shot which comes with a vicious back spin, since Black's pawn loss proves to be only temporary.

QUESTION: Can White get the superior ending if he manoeuvres his queen to f6? --- ANSWER: Let's look: 21.Qf4 h5 22.Qf6 Qxf6 23.exf6 Kd7 24.Bb5 Kd6 25.f4 e5 26.Bxc6 bxc6 27.fxe5+ Kxe5 and Houdini rates this ending at 0.00. I let it play it out to its conclusion and 28.c4 dxc4 29.Ra6 Kxf6 30.Rf1+ Ke6 31.Kc3 f5 32.Rxa5 Ra8 33.Rxa8 Rxa8 34.Kb4 Kd6 35.Rd1+ Kc7 36.Rd4 Re8 37.Rxc4 Re2 38.g3 Re3 39.Rc3 Re4+ 40.Kb3 Rg4 has White unable to make progress.

**21...O-O!**

Slightly more accurate than 21...bxa6 22.Rxc6 O-O 23.Rbb6 Rxc6 24.Rxc6 Qb7 25.Qc5 which could be a shade better for White.

**22.Bxb7 Bxb7 23.Rxb7 Qd8 24.Qf4**

24.g3 Rc4 25.Qd3 Re4! ( 25...Rxa4 26.Ra7 is better for White ) 26.Qb5 Rxe5 27.Rb8 Qf6 28.Qc5 Rxb8 29.Rxb8+ Kh7 30.Qf8 Qg7 31.Qxg7+ Kxg7 32.Rb5 Rf5 33.f4 g5 34.fxg5 hxg5 35.hxg5 Rxg5 36.c4 Rg4 37.cxd5 Rxa4 should be drawn.

**24...Kg7**

Black may stand slightly better after 24...Rc4! 25.Qxh6 Rxh4 26.Qxf8+ Qxf8 27.Rb8 Rxa4 but White should still hold the draw with correct play.

**25.Ra7 Rc4 26.Qf6+ Qxf6 27.exf6+ Kxf6 28.Rxa5 Rxh4**

EXERCISE (critical decision): Should White play 29 Ra7 or 29 g3? The correct answer ends in a draw. White struggles if he misses on this one.

**29.g3?**

After this innocent-looking move, for Black, lean times are over. Prosperity and happiness are there to greet him around the corner. White soon experiences an uneasy surmise of something gone awry, yet may have difficulty putting a finger on a specific cause. White's last move gravely endangers his position by weakening the light squares and offering Black's king chances to infiltrate the kingside later on.

ANSWER: White holds the balance with 29.Ra7! Rh2 30.Rg1 h5 31.a5 h4 32.a6 h3 33.gxh3 Rxf2+ 34.Kc1 Rf3 35.Rb7 Ra8 36.a7 Rxc3 37.Rf1+ Ke5 38.Rfxf7 Rxh3 and 39.Rb8 is met with 39...Rh8 . The game should end in a draw as well.

**29...Rc4 30.Ra1**

Endgame principle: Place your rooks behind passed pawns.

**30...Rfc8 31.Ra3 h5 32.Rb5**

32.Ra7 is met by 32...g5 with ...h4 to follow.

**32...g5**

Now it's a race between passed a- and h-pawns.

**33.a5 h4 34.a6**

White may have been better off swapping away a pair of pawns after 34.gxh4 gxh4 .

**34...h3 35.a7 h2 36.Rb1 Ra8 37.Rh1 Rc7 38.Rxh2**

38.Kd3?! Raxa7 39.Rxa7 Rxa7 40.c4 dxc4+ 41.Kxc4 Kf5 42.Rxh2 e5 43.Kb5 e4 44.c4 Ra2 setting up the threat of ...e3: ( 45.Rh7?! Rb2+ 46.Kc6 Kg6 47.Rh1 Rxf2 48.Re1 f5 49.c5 Kf6 50.Kc7 Ke5 51.c6 Rc2 52.Kd7 f4 53.gxf4+ gxf4 54.c7 f3 and Black wins. ) ( 45.g4+ should be met with 45...Ke5! , and now if ( not 45...Kxg4?? 46.f3+! exf3 47.Rxa2 Kf4 48.c5 g4 49.c6 g3 50.c7 f2 51.c8=Q f1=Q+ 52.Kb4 Qb1+ 53.Ka3 Qd3+ and the game will end in a draw ) 46.f4+ gxf4! 47.Rxa2 e3 , Black's passers are too quick. )

**38...Raxa7 39.Rxa7 Rxa7 40.Rh1 Kf5 41.f3 Rc7**

QUESTION: Isn't this a dead draw? After all, it's four pawns versus four, all on the same side. --- ANSWER: Black's one large bonus in the McCutcheon is his superior pawn structure. In this instance Black has excellent winning chances due to the following factors: 1. White is in effect a pawn down since Black's d5-pawn holds back a pair of doubled, isolated white c-pawns. --- 2. White's king is tied to defence of the c3-pawn. --- 3. The black king's participation only adds adhesion to the steadily growing, nasty sentiment against White's position. Black may soon puncture White's attempted kingside fortress with either ...g4, or ...e5-e4, when Black's king infiltrates and creates a passed pawn. White will have difficulty halting it (since his king is tangled up in defence of the c3-pawn).

**42.Kd3**

The king's trial is about to begin. Unfortunately for him, a verdict has already been reached.

**42...e5 43.Re1 f6 44.Re2 g4!**

The breakthrough we all saw coming. This move creates the necessary puncture for Black's king to enter.

**45.Rf2 Rc6**

45...gxf3! looks slightly more accurate. After 46.Rxf3+ Ke6 47.Rf2 Rg7 48.Rg2 Rg4 49.Ke2 f5 sets up the threat of ...f4 and White drops a pawn, no matter where he moves.

**46.Kd2**

46.fxg4+ Kxg4 47.c4! dxc4+ 48.Ke4 c3 49.Kd5 Kxg3 50.Rf1 Rb6 51.Kc4 Rd6 52.Kc5 Ra6 53.Kd5 Kg4 54.Ke4 Ra4+ 55.Ke3 Rf4 and Black consolidates.

**46...gxf3 47.Rxf3+ Kg4 48.Rd3**

White's aimless rook has nothing better to do with his time than shift about in desultory fashion.

**48...Rc5 49.Re3**

This rook clings to the g3-pawn like a frightened child to her doll.

**49...e4**

Zugzwang! Black continues to pinch exposed nerves on g3 and c3 with a heavy hand. For White's king and rook, who have been nurtured upon euphemisms and half-truths, an encounter with the real always comes as a shock. They soon trip over multiple banana peels and tumble over each other, like Keystone Kops in a chase gone wrong.

**50.Re1**

50.Ke2 fails to 50...f5 51.Ke1 Rc8 52.Ke2 Rh8 53.Kd2 Rh3 .

**50...Kxg3 51.Rf1 Rc6 52.Rf5 Kg4!**

The d5-pawn isn't necessary anymore.

52...Rd6?! allows White to continue to resist with 53.Ke3 .

**53.Rxd5 f5**

Black's two connected passers easily outgun White's sorry-looking pair on the c-file.

**54.Re5 Kf4**

One doesn't send a royal an invitation. It is the royal who sends for you.

**55.Ra5 Rd6+ 56.Ke2 Rh6 57.c4 Rh2+ 58.Kd1**

The king's nervous pacing threatens to wear a groove in the carpet. He continues to absorb the abuse with ill-grace.

**58...e3**

. Black is much too fast.

One possible finish would be 58...e3 59.Rd5 Ke4 . "I will now live your life," Black's king tells his now deposed d1-brother. "And why not? Your life is so much more interesting than mine," he adds. With 60.Rd8 f4 61.c5 Rh1+ 62.Ke2 f3# , the white king's hair turned white overnight, having undergone a dreadful ordeal from Black's king, rook and passed pawns. --- SUMMARY: 14 Nxd4 leads to more technical, quieter positions (than Anand's 14 h5!?) and we should be holding our own, since our superior pawn structure balances out with White's space. This game is an example of what can happen to White if he takes on structural weakness and then later loses the initiative in an ending.

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.e5 h6 6.Bd2 Bxc3 7.bxc3 Ne4 8.Qg4 g6 9.Bd3 Nxd2 10.Kxd2 c5 11.Nf3 Nc6**

This time, ...Nc6 precedes ...Qa5.

**12.dxc5**

QUESTION: Why would White voluntarily accept tripled pawns? --- ANSWER: For the following reasons: 1. White clears the d4-square for his knight. --- 2. White eliminates all ...cxd4 possibilities. --- 3. White eliminates all ...c4 ideas. --- 4. Essentially, White takes on c5 to cut down on Black's options.

Note that 12.h4 Qa5 13.Qf4 transposes to the positions we looked at in the first two games of the chapter.

**12...Qa5**

Black prepares to pick up the loose end on c5.

**13.Qf4 Qxc5 14.Nd4 Bd7**

Perhaps Black's most promising line is: 14...Nxd4! . --- QUESTION: Why would Black agree to fix White's damaged structure? --- ANSWER: 1. White's remaining knight is a dangerous piece and an exchange greatly reduces Black's fears of walking into an attack. --- 2. The move only partially fixes White's structure, since Black has the plan ...Qa5+, ...b6 and ...Ba6, forcing the swap of another piece and also weakening White's defence of the c2-pawn, as in the following game: 15.cxd4 Qa5+ 16.Ke3 (as you may have noticed, Black's king isn't the only worried king on the board) 16...b6! and Black commences the above-mentioned plan. With 17.h4 Ba6 18.a4 ( more accurate is 18.h5 gxh5 19.Rxh5 Rc8 20.Kf3! Bxd3 21.cxd3 Rc2 and Houdini rates it at dead even here ) 18...Rc8 19.Ra3? ( 19.Rhc1 was necessary ) 19...Qb4! 20.Rha1 Bxd3 21.cxd3 Rc2 22.Kf3 , A.Lanc-I.Glek, Stare Mesto 1992. White has been thrown back into passive defence and his king looks insecure.

I don't think Black equalizes with 14...a6 15.Rhb1 b5?! ( 15...Na5 16.Nb3 Nxb3+ 17.axb3 Bd7 and White stands slightly better with more control over the dark squares ) 16.Nxc6 Qxc6 17.a4! bxa4 18.Rxa4 Qc5 19.Qf6 Rg8 20.Bb5+! Kf8 21.Rf4 Ra7 , N.De Firmian-J.Kraai, Reno 2003. White is winning after the correct 22.Bd3! with the threat of Bxg6.

**15.Qf6**

White can also utilize the open b-file to pressure the b7-pawn with 15.Rhb1! : ( . Black castles into the attack with 15...O-O-O 16.Rb5 Qe7 17.Rab1 b6 18.Nxc6 Bxc6 19.R5b4 g5 20.Qe3 Qc5 21.f4 , V.Anand-H.Nakamura, Monte Carlo (rapid) 2011. Black looks equal after 21...Kc7 22.Rf1 Qxe3+ 23.Kxe3 Rdf8 . ) ( . Even more scary is 15...b6 16.Qf6 and Houdini claims Black is fine after the crazy sequence 16...Rh7 17.Nb5 Kf8 18.Bxg6 Rg7 19.Bd3 Ne7 20.Nd6 Nf5! 21.Nxf7 Kg8! 22.Nxh6+ Nxh6 23.Qxh6 Qxf2+ 24.Kc1 d4 . ) ( . Black's safest is 15...Na5 16.Nb3 Nxb3+ 17.axb3 a6 18.Qd4 Qe7 when Black should be okay, despite White's extra space. ( ) )

**15...O-O!**

Despite knowing that White is well-placed to prise open the kingside, this is nevertheless the best move as the alternatives renders the king rook off-kilter at h7, g8 or f8. Black trusts in his queenside counterattack, especially if White wants to go for broke.

**16.Nxc6 Bxc6 17.h4**

When we launch an attack, do we not all dream of perfect outcomes? White allows circumstantial evidence to sway him. Believe it or not, this move is slow and White must play carefully to maintain equality. --- QUESTION: Shouldn't White sac on g6?

ANSWER: Maybe that is what White should have played but Black has a draw if he wants one as 17.Bxg6 fxg6 18.Qxg6+ Kh8 19.Qxh6+ is drawn. --- QUESTION: Why can't White play for a win by taking the fourth pawn with check, after 19...Kg8 20.Qxe6+ ? --- ANSWER: An attack needs more than a single piece. White stands worse after 20...Rf7 21.Qg6+ Kf8 22.f3 Re8 23.Rae1 Rg7 24.Qf5+ Kg8 25.Rhg1 d4 and White's king has no defenders and that leaves him busted.

**17...Rac8 18.Bxg6**

The bishop approaches like a zealous worshipper to the altar of the high priest.

**18...Be8!**

Double attack. Black goes for the full point! It appears as if the bishop, with almost bovine indifference, shifts to e8, appearing to placidly chew grass while standing next to his butcher. But this is not the case, since now White's bishop and the c3-pawn hang simultaneously.

18...fxg6 19.Qxg6+ leads to perpetual check.

**19.Bd3 Qxc3+ 20.Ke2**

EXERCISE (combination alert): It looks as if Black can resign. After all, White merely has to lift his rook to g3 via h3 and Black is fried. Yet appearances are deceiving. Black's counterattack is not to be underestimated. What did Lputian play? --- ANSWER: Undermining of a key defender/double attack.

**20...Bb5! 21.Bxb5**

The bishop bounds for b5 the way a retriever fetches a ball.

21.Rh3?? is too slow since 21...Qxc2+! wins on the spot.

**21...Qxc2+ 22.Kf1 Qb2!**

This double attack regains the piece.

**23.Re1 Qxb5+ 24.Kg1 Kh7**

Black is up a pawn but White still may generate counterplay based on Black's exposed king.

**25.Rh3 Qd7**

EXERCISE (critical decision): White can play the immediate 26 Rg3 or can build with 26 Ree3. Only one of them allows White maximum resistance. He suffers in the other. Decide carefully. Which one would you play?

**26.Ree3?!**

Excessive optimism is the great nudger who pushes us past tolerable limits.

ANSWER: The move order matters. The correct path of greatest resistance is 26.Rg3! Rg8 27.Ree3 d4 28.Ref3 Rxg3 29.Rxg3 Rg8 30.Rxg8 Kxg8 31.Qxh6 d3 32.Qg5+ Kf8 33.Qh6+ Ke7 34.Qg5+ Ke8 35.Qg8+ with perpetual check.

**26...Qd8!**

This move creates confusion in the attacking ranks.

**27.Qf3?**

Another mistake.

27.Qf4? is met with 27...Rc1+ .

White's path of maximum resistance lies in 27.Ref3! Rc1+ 28.Kh2 Qxf6 29.Rxf6 Rc7 30.Rhf3 and it isn't easy for Black to make progress.

**27...f5!**

Now Black consolidates since his king is a lot safer than a few moves ago.

**28.Rb3**

White is unlikely to survive 28.exf6 Qxf6 29.Qxf6 Rxf6 . Black's two central passed pawns should take the day.

**28...Rc7 29.Qe3 b6 30.Rf3 Rc4**

30...Qxh4?? is just a cheapo. White wins after 31.Rh3 .

**31.g3 Re4 32.Qc3**

EXERCISE (combination alert): How did Black increase his advantage? --- ANSWER: The e5-pawn can't be covered.

**32...Qb8!**

The queen likes and dislikes people based on how useful they are to her.

**33.Qc6**

33.Re3?? walks into 33...d4 .

**33...Qxe5 34.Rfc3**

It's never pleasant when we must economize from an old lavish lifestyle to which we had grown accustomed. White finds himself down two pawns without compensation.

**34...Re1+ 35.Kh2**

EXERCISE (calculation): Should Black play 35...f4 or 35...Qe2? Which move is stronger?

**35...f4?!**

This still wins but not as strong as the alternative: ANSWER: 35...Qe2! is an instant game-ender after 36.Qc7+ Kg8 37.Qf4 Qf1 38.Qf3 Re2 and White must hand over his queen.

**36.Qd7+**

Minasian refuses to bow to despondency and fights back. However, he simply lacks the resources to do so.

**36...Kh8?!**

Lputian contemplates the temptation and mistakenly decides to pass.

Correct was 36...Kg6! 37.gxf4 Qe2 38.Rg3+ Kh5! . --- Some of us may strongly suspect that Black's king is in danger. But if we look closer, we see that he is remarkably safe and in reality akin to the desert mouse who foiled the rattlesnake (who can only slither away in frustration). After 39.Rg2 Qd1 40.Rg7 Rh1+ 41.Kg3 Qg1+ 42.Kf3 Rxf4+! 43.Kxf4 Qxf2+ 44.Ke5 Re1+ , the game is over, since 45.Kd6 is met with 45...Qc5# !

**37.Rc8 Qg7**

Black may have had better winning chances with 37...fxg3+! 38.Rxg3 Qf6 39.Rxf8+ Qxf8 40.f3 Re2+ 41.Kh1 ( 41.Kg1?? Qc5+ forces mate ) 41...Rf2 42.Qxe6 Rxf3 43.Qe5+ Kh7 44.Qc7+ Qf7 45.Qc2+ Kh8 46.Qc8+ Qf8 when White runs out of checks and must swap queens.

**38.Rxf8+ Qxf8**

EXERCISE (critical decision): Should White play 39 gxf4 or 39 Rf3? Only one of the moves may save him.

**39.Rf3?**

White's initiative looks extinguished but isn't. A single ember remains glowing within the ash.

ANSWER: He should play 39.gxf4! Qxf4+ 40.Kg2 and the gravity of White's threats soon descends upon Black. This one won't be so easy to convert. The trouble is, after 40...Qe4+ 41.Rf3 Rg1+ 42.Kxg1 Qxf3 43.Qxe6 , Black's king looks too exposed to squeeze out the full point.

**39...fxg3+ 40.Kg2**

EXERCISE (combination alert) : How did Black draw on a tactical resource and consolidate? --- ANSWER: Deflection.

**40...Rg1+!**

A faint smile of recognition flickers across the rook's lips as he discovers the white king's hiding place.

**41.Kxg1 Qxf3 42.Qc8+ Kg7 43.Qc7+ Kf6 44.fxg3 d4**

Another of fate's unmerciful dispensations greets White. There is no perpetual check and Black's passed d-pawn is decisive.

**45.Kh2 d3 46.Qd8+ Ke5 47.Qh8+ Qf6 48.Qb8+**

White's queen screams obscenities at Black's king, who smiles indulgently and taunts her with "The dying wolf's baying can't harm the moon."

**48...Ke4 49.Qxa7 e5**

49...Qf2+ 50.Kh3 Qf1+ 51.Kh2 Qe2+ 52.Kh3 d2 is a quicker path.

**50.Qa3 Qf2+ 51.Kh3 Qf1+ 52.Kh2 Kf3!**

Black's agenda isn't only promotion of a pawn. Black's king and queen decide to suspend the Golden Rule and plot their cousin's murder. A cheap, one move mating threat is always a reliable comfort which lifts our spirits.

**53.Qa8+ e4 54.Qf8+ Ke2 55.Qxh6 Qf2+ 56.Kh3 Qf5+**

. SUMMARY: 12 dxc5 shouldn't give Black too much to worry about. I like the plan 14...Nxd4! best. Black gets excellent counterplay down the c-file.

0-1

### (60)Akopian, V.   --   Volkov, S. 40: Monarch Assurance Open, Port Erin  2006   0-1   C12 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.e5 h6 6.Bd2 Bxc3 7.bxc3 Ne4 8.Qg4 Kf8**

Korchnoi's favourite line. We enter McCutcheon Part B, where Black refuses to weaken with 8...g6 and hands over castling rights in order to do so. --- QUESTION: Isn't this too large a concession? After all, now White knows the black king's address. Won't it be easy to whip up an attack with the space advantage? --- ANSWER: White usually does get to attack in this line but again at a cost: 1. Black's position, including the kingside, remains for now weakness-free. --- 2. In order to attack, White must mass all available forces on the kingside. This strategy by default, leaves White's queenside and centre vulnerable to counterattacks. --- 3. White's king is on d2, not such a safe square. Black has a choice of two plans: a) Play ...c4, driving White's potent d3-bishop off its dangerous diagonal with tempo. Then play for a ...b5, ...b4 break, undermining the c3-pawn and by default, the d4-pawn. --- b) A secondary plan for Black, which we examine in this chapter is ...cxd4, followed by ...Qa5+, ...b6 and ...Ba6. Then we swap away one of White's best attackers with ...Bxd3. This not only helps our king but also leaves the c2-pawn vulnerable.

**9.Bd3 Nxd2 10.Kxd2 c5**

QUESTION: Why can't Black take the steam out of White's attack by removing queens from the board with 10...Qg5+ ? --- ANSWER: The idea certainly destroys White's attacking plans but the question remains: Does Black actually equalize in the coming ending? Top level games suggest that White retains the superior chances after 11.Qxg5 hxg5 12.g4! . So far, White scores a robust 85% after this move which is favoured by Peter Leko. --- QUESTION: What is White's idea behind the move? --- ANSWER: White fixes the g5-pawn as a stationary target. Now Black is unable to play ...g4. Now play may continue: ( 12...f6 13.h4! (Principles: Create confrontation and open the game when leading in development. At the time of this writing, Black lost all five games in my database from this position) 13...fxe5 14.dxe5 Nc6 15.Nf3 gxh4 16.Rae1 h3 17.Rh2 (the h-pawn isn't running away) 17...Bd7 18.Reh1 Ke7 19.Rxh3 Rxh3 20.Rxh3 Rg8 21.Ke3 and Houdini claims this position is equal but this may be a misassessment. White owns space, has the superior king position and his pieces are far more active. Black's cosmetically better-looking pawn structure does not make up for the flaws in his position, J.Gdanski-P.Dittmar, Saint Vincent 2000. ) ( 12...c5 13.Nf3 : ( 13...c4 14.Be2 f6 15.h4 gxh4 16.Nxh4 and Black is in serious trouble as he is so far behind in development, A.Haugen-R.Giese, correspondence 2002. For example: 16...Rg8 17.g5! is very difficult for Black to meet. ) ( 13...Nc6 14.dxc5 f6 15.h4! ( White can also toss in 15.exf6! gxf6 16.h4 since 16...e5?? is met with 17.hxg5! Rxh1 18.Rxh1 e4 19.gxf6 exd3 ( 19...exf3 20.Bg6! wins ) 20.Ng5! is winning ) 15...Nxe5 16.Nxe5 fxe5 17.hxg5 Rxh1 18.Rxh1 Kg8 19.Bb5! and Black is unable to develop, even this late in the ending. After 19...b6 20.c4! Rb8 , P.Leko-ENSAM College, Paris (simul) 2005, 21.c6 gives White a winning position. ) )

**11.Nf3**

Later in the chapter, we will look at 11.h4 .

**11...c4**

Given an exclam by GM Neil McDonald. --- QUESTION: Doesn't this violate the principles: Don't close the centre when attacked on the wing and don't fix your pawns on the same colour as your remaining bishop? --- ANSWER: The violation is deliberate and there are good reasons for it. By playing 11...c4: 1. We force White's powerful d3 bishop off its dangerous diagonal. --- 2. We deny White all dxc5 ideas (which clears d4 for a white piece).

In the next two games, we will look at 11...cxd4!? which has scored remarkably well for Black, although admittedly from a small sample of only eight games.

**12.Be2 Nc6 13.a4**

This is White's highest scoring and probably most accurate move, inhibiting Black's intended plan ...b5 and ...b4.

13.Rhb1 Rb8 14.a4 b6 15.h4 Rb7! (covering the f7-pawn laterally) 16.Qf4 Ke7!? . This is a recurring theme in the ...c4 lines. Black, after sealing the queenside, prepares to run his king over there. Following 17.g4 Qf8! 18.Rg1 , obviously White's queenside attack has gotten him nowhere, so he shifts his attention to the kingside and after 18...Kd8 19.g5 Ne7 (taking control over the f5-square) 20.h5 Bd7 21.Nh4 Be8 ( also playable is 21...hxg5 22.Qxg5 Rh7 23.Qf4 Rh8 ) 22.gxh6 Rxh6 23.Qg4 Rh7 24.Ng2 Kc8 , the position remains in stasis and the players agreed to a draw, C.Lutz-V.Ivanchuk, Gothenburg 2005. This is a model example by Ivanchuk setting up fortresses on both wings.

13.h4 b5! (Black tosses in this useful move while he has the chance) 14.a3 Bd7 15.h5 a5 16.Rhb1 Rb8 17.Qf4 Ke7 18.g4 Qf8 19.Qe3 Kd8 20.Ne1 Kc7 21.f4 b4! and Korchnoi walks his king to the safety of the blocked queenside...then promptly opens it! After 22.axb4 axb4 23.cxb4 Rxb4 24.Nf3 g6!? 25.Qc3 Rxb1 26.Rxb1 gxh5 27.gxh5 Qe7 28.Qa1 Rb8 29.Rxb8 Kxb8 30.c3 f5! , Black stands just a shade better due to the weakness of the h5-pawn. The maestro went on to outplay his opponent and win the ending, L.Christiansen-V.Korchnoi, Reykjavik 2000.

**13...Bd7 14.h4**

It's interesting to note that Houdini actually prefers Black's position here. We are at a crossroads. Black has a choice of two possible plans: Plan A - Black plays ...Be8, ...Rg8 and then runs the king to the queenside. --- Plan B - Black's king entrenches himself on the kingside, confident that he will survive the coming assault.

**14...Qe7!?**

An example of Plan A.

The bishop meditates in cloistral calm with 14...Be8 : ( 15.Rh3 Rg8 16.h5 Ke7 17.Nh4 Qa5 18.Kc1 Kd8 19.f4 Bd7 20.f5 and Houdini prefers Black slightly while I concede that most attackers would take White who possesses the kingside initiative, T.Petrosian-S.Volkov, Moscow 2006. ) ( 15.Qf4 Ke7 16.Rh3 Kd7 17.Rg3 Rg8 18.h5 Qa5 19.Nh2 Ne7 20.Kd1 Rd8 21.Qc1 Kc8 (Black 'castled' queenside) 22.Qa3 Qc7 23.Bg4 Kb8 24.Nf1 Nc6 25.f4 , K.Asrian-S.Volkov, Warsaw 2005. At this point Houdini continues to favour Black and wants to play 25...Ne7 26.a5 f5 27.Bf3 g5 28.hxg6 Nxg6 29.Qc1 h5! 30.Bxh5 Nh4! 31.Bf3 Rxg3 32.Nxg3 Nxf3 33.gxf3 Qg7 and Black's initiative is worth more than White's useless extra pawn. ( ) )

**15.h5 b6**

This pretty much fixes the a4-pawn as a permanent weakness.

**16.Nh4**

Clearing the way for f4, and also Rh3/Rg3 or Rf3.

**16...Qg5+!**

A wise precaution, otherwise White's kingside attack may get out of control. --- QUESTION: Wait a minute! On the 10th move, you said this idea may be favourable for White. Now you give the same plan an exclamation mark. Why? --- ANSWER: This is a better version of this ending for Black than the ones we looked at in the notes of 10...Qg5+, for two reasons: 1. Black isn't behind in development in this one. --- 2. White's h-pawn is on h5, meaning he no longer has access to the h4 kingside break.

**17.f4**

17.Qxg5 hxg5 18.Nf3 f6 19.g4 Ke7 and I actually prefer Black with the superior pawn structure here.

**17...Qxg4 18.Bxg4 Ne7**

Otherwise, White gets the initiative if f5 is allowed.

**19.a5**

Okay, please disregard my earlier comment - "This pretty much fixes a4 as a permanent weakness". The pawn is still a weakness on a5, since a rook must always guard against ideas like ...a6 and ...Nc6.

**19...b5 20.Bf3**

McDonald suggests 20.Be2 intending an eventual g4 and f5 break. Black can try 20...g6 21.g3 a6 22.Ng2 Kg7 23.g4 Nc6 24.Ne3 g5! 25.f5 ( 25.Rhf1 Raf8 26.fxg5 hxg5 and I like Black after the coming ...Rh6 and ...f6 ) 25...Rab8 . White must be on constant lookout for ...b4 tricks. I don't think Black stands worse here.

**20...g5!**

Black frees his position on the kingside. A pacifist strategy designed to shame the opponent into submission doesn't work against a conscienceless enemy. At some point, the oppressed side must lash out or perish.

**21.hxg6 fxg6 22.g4 Kf7**

Black connects his rooks. If given time, Black may play for a ...g5 trick so White's coming thematic sac looks correct.

**23.f5!**

The vanguard strikes first. This move cleaves a sizable gash in Black's kingside structural integrity.

**23...exf5 24.gxf5 Bxf5 25.Nxf5 gxf5**

White managed to break up Black's kingside pawns and give himself a passed e-pawn. I think the position is dynamically balanced. Akopian may have overestimated his position and begins to overpress.

**26.Rab1 a6 27.Rh3 Rac8**

Leaving open ...Rc6 options.

**28.Rg1 Rcg8 29.Rgh1 Kg7**

Most certainly not 29...Rg6?? 30.Bh5 .

**30.Ke3 Rf8 31.Rg1+ Kh7 32.Kf4**

White goes for the full point.

The draw is his after 32.Rgh1 Kg7 33.Rg1+ Kh7 34.Rgh1 .

**32...Rhg8**

Black, realizing that business takes precedence, does what is necessary.

**33.Rhg3?**

A military leader must accurately gauge the capabilities of those under his command. Maybe the most accurate annotation mark to this move would be "?!?". The text move is brilliant yet incorrect. The seeds of this idea are planted in stony soil.

After 33.Rgh1 Rg6 34.Bh5 Rg5! ( 34...Re6?? is Black's version of the overpress. He loses after 35.Rg1 Rg8 36.Rhg3 Rxg3 37.Rxg3 Rc6 38.Rg1 Re6 39.Bf7 Rc6 40.e6 when White's king entry to e5 is decisive ) 35.Bf3 Rg6 , the game will end in a draw.

**33...Rxg3 34.Rxg3 Ng6+**

This move wins the exchange, but the story is just beginning.

**35.Rxg6**

The rook believes he evades truth by killing the messenger. White foresaw this exchange sac and misevaluated the ending.

35.Ke3?? is met with 35...f4+ .

**35...Kxg6 36.Bxd5**

This is the position Akopian banked on before entering this line. I don't blame him. If a student asked me to evaluate White's position, I would say advantage White (and be absolutely wrong!). For the exchange, White gets: 1. Two connected central passers. --- 2. The possibility of a Bb7 raid. --- 3. A dominant king. --- 4. The illusion that White's bishop seems to be able to deal with Black's passed h-pawn, while his king blockades the passed f-pawn. However, Black stands better and the sac is like a man who sells his shares of a goldless goldmine for 10 cents on the dollar, and then discovers to his horror the following week, that a rich vein has just been struck. Black's single plus in the position: His rook is more valuable than White's bishop! No position is too chaotic for a comp to analyse, and they say Black is winning, despite appearances! --- QUESTION: You mainly use Houdini for your books. Is that the strongest program? --- ANSWER: Most first grade children know more about computers than your comp-challenged writer. My best bet is to quote an authority for a possible answer. GM Larry Kaufman, co-author of the Komodo engine (and the creator of the evaluation function for Rybka 3) opined in a recent interview, "Komodo is best at evaluating middlegame positions accurately once the tactics are resolved. Stockfish seems to be best in the endgame and in seeing very deep tactics. Houdini is the best at blitz and at seeing tactics quickly. Rybka is just obsolete; I like to think of Komodo as its spiritual descendant, since I worked on the evaluation for both, although the rest of the engines are not similar. Fritz is just too far below these top engines to be useful." I have a feeling my Fritz and Rybka engines aren't going to be happy about this interview and may write Kaufman a nasty email. In my opinion, all the comps mentioned are just fine at the club or internet level for general study, since the differences may be too subtle to really matter, unless you are one of those obsessive players who spends three hours working out some detail for a line on the 23rd move.

**36...h5**

Black begins to roll his passed h-pawn forward.

**37.Bg2**

The b7-raid fails as after 37.Bb7 h4 38.Bxa6? Black has 38...Rb8! This key idea paralyzes White's bishop. Following 39.d5 Kf7! 40.Kf3 Rg8! (threat: ...h3, ...h2 and ...h1=Q). 41.Bb7 h3 42.d6 Ke6 43.a6 h2 44.Ke3 Rg7! 45.a7 Rxb7 46.a8=Q h1=Q 47.Qe8+ Kd5 48.d7 Qe1+ 49.Kf4 Qe4+ 50.Kg5 Qg4+ 51.Kf6 Qh4+ 52.Kxf5 ( 52.Kg6 Rb6+ 53.Kxf5 Qf2+ 54.Kg4 Ke4! and if 55.d8=Q Qf3+ 56.Kh4 Rh6+ 57.Kg5 Qf4# is mate! ) 52...Qh7+ 53.Kf6 Qxd7 , Black wins. Amazing!

**37...h4 38.Bh3**

EXERCISE (planning/calculation): Let's take stock: 1. White managed to blockade both Black passers. --- 2. He ties Black down to defence of the f5-pawn. --- 3. Meanwhile, White's passed e- and d-pawns are ready to surge forward. --- It looks like White is winning. He isn't! Come up with a winning plan for Black. There are two ways to win, and as you may have guessed, both are nightmarishly difficult to solve! --- ANSWER: It's a disquieting sensation to have an opponent effortlessly read and counter your secret intentions.

**38...Kf7!!**

The king's unresponsive silence is his way of laughing at others, without them knowing. Astonishment is a short-lived yet gripping emotion. Black hands over the f5-pawn to infiltrate enemy lines with his rook.

ANSWER#2: 38...Rd8!! 39.Bxf5+ Kf7 40.Bh3 b4! (Black threatens ...b3!) 41.cxb4 Rxd4+ 42.Ke3 Rd8 43.Bf1 Rc8 44.Kd4 Ke7 45.Bh3 Rf8 46.Kxc4 Rf3 47.Bc8 Kd8 48.Bb7 Rf7 49.Bh1 Rf1 50.Ba8 h3 51.Kc5 Kc7 52.c4 Re1 53.Kd4 Ra1! and Black wins, since ...h2 and ...h1Q follow.

**39.Kxf5**

If 39.Bxf5 Ke7 40.d5 Rxf5+! 41.Kxf5 h3 42.d6+ Ke8! ( 42...Kd7?? 43.e6+! Kxd6 44.Kf6 h2 45.e7 Kd7 46.Kf7 h1=Q 47.e8=Q+ is drawn ) 43.e6 h2 , White's queening attempt is too slow.

**39...Ke8+ 40.Ke4 Rf2**

The restorative effects of Black's 38th move fail to wear off, as he comes up with this decisive rook infiltration.

**41.d5 Rxc2 42.Kd4 Rd2+ 43.Kc5 b4!?**

This wins but much simpler is 43...Rd3! 44.Bf5 h3 45.Kc6 h2 46.Be4 Re3 47.Bh1 Rxe5 48.Kc7 Re7+ 49.Kb6 Re1 and Black converts easily.

**44.d6!**

White's best practical try since both 44.Kxb4 Rxd5

and 44.Kxc4 bxc3 45.Kxc3 Rxd5 lose without a fight.

**44...bxc3 45.Bg4!**

Threatening e6, followed by Bh7+ and e7+. White is queening as well! Unfortunately the idea, in the end, fails to mitigate White's misery by even an iota.

**45...c2 46.e6 c1=Q 47.Bh5+ Kf8 48.e7+ Kg7 49.e8=Q**

This is about as awkward as bumping into the ghost of a man you murdered, similar to that uncomfortable chat Macbeth had with Banquo's disembodied spirit. Luckily for Black, he is on the move and White's king gets no rest from this point.

**49...Qa3+!**

The queen wears the mask of external politeness, all the while seething inside. Black's long dormant initiative arises once again, in a second, more deadly incarnation. Now we witness the pathos of the white king's dramatic descent from a life of privilege to no life at all.

**50.Kb6 Qxd6+ 51.Ka7 Qc7+!**

. EXERCISE (calculation): Images too terrible to translate to mere words, smite the white king's eyes. He already stands on the scaffold, awaiting his fate. All which is required of us is a wave of the hand to give the executioner the signal. Without moving the pieces, work out Black's forced mate in nine moves from this point.

ANSWER: 51...Qc7+ 52.Kxa6 Rd6+ 53.Kb5 Rd5+ and the pounding continues without a break, similar to the smashing of waves on the stones of a castle by the sea. White can no longer hold out after 54.Kb4 Qxa5+ 55.Kxc4 Qc5+ 56.Kb3 Rd3+ 57.Kb2 Qb4+ 58.Kc1 Qd2+ 59.Kb1 Rb3+ 60.Ka1 Qb2# mate! A very impressive feat, if you saw the line to its completion. --- SUMMARY: Black has two plans in the ...Kf8/...c4 line: Plan A - Black plays ...Be8, ...Rg8 and then runs his king to the queenside. --- Plan B - Black's king entrenches himself on the kingside, confident that he will survive the coming assault.

0-1

### (61)Roser, K.   --   Vallejo Pons, F. 41: European Chship, Aix-les-Bains  2011   0-1   C12 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.e5 h6 6.Bd2 Bxc3 7.bxc3 Ne4 8.Qg4 Kf8 9.Bd3 Nxd2 10.Kxd2 c5 11.Nf3 cxd4**

This is a rare line which caught my eye while doing research for this book. Black's move has only been played eight times and has been championed by super-GMs Vallejo Pons and Nepomniachtchi. So far, it has scored a whopping 75% for Black. --- QUESTION: What are the ideas and benefits of the move over the normal ...c4 plan? --- ANSWER: The following ideas are behind the move: 1. It follows the principle: Counter in the centre when attacked on the wing. Depending on which way White captures the d4-pawn, Black plans either ...Qa5+ or ...Qg5+. --- 2. Black sheds himself of his bad bishop with ...b6 and ...Ba6, then plays down the c-file. --- 3. After a bishop swap, Black can take advantage of the c4-hole with ...Nc6, ...Na5 and ...Nc4. If White plays cxd3 in response to ...Bxd3, then White is in effect a pawn down since his kingside majority is frozen, while Black owns a healthy two to one majority on the queenside.

**12.cxd4**

In the next game, we will look at 12.Nxd4 .

**12...Qa5+ 13.Ke2**

White's alternative is 13.c3 b6 14.Qf4 Nc6 15.h4 Ba6 16.Bg6 Nd8! (dual purpose: Black covers the mate threat on c7, while clearing the c-file for his rook to pressure c3) 17.Ne1 (to defend c3 with Rh3) 17...Qb5 ( Black can also try 17...Rc8 18.Rh3 Qa3 19.Bc2 Qb2 20.Rb1 Qxa2 21.Rb4 (threatening Ra4) 21...Rc4 22.Nd3 Qa5 23.Rf3 Bb5 24.Rxc4 Bxc4 25.g4 Qa3 with ...Qe7 to come and I just don't believe in White's full compensation for the pawn ) 18.Qf3 Rc8 with at least an equal position for Black, Borisenko,V-Anton Guijarro,D Albena 2011.

**13...Nc6 14.Qf4 b6**

A key part of Black's plan is ...Ba6 to swap off Black's bad bishop and eliminates White's best defender of the c2-pawn.

**15.g4?!**

QUESTION: Why criticize this most natural of moves? What else is there for White but to launch an attack?

ANSWER: The human, though probably incorrect, move. White's confidence in his attack isn't born from the conclusions derived from the actual facts. What I love most about the 11...cxd4 line is that White's 'normal' moves don't seem to work out well for him (such as the aggressive text continuation).<level/>

Houdini suggests going into an inhuman defensive posture with 15.Rhc1 Ba6 16.Kf1 Rc8 17.g3 Ke7 . I still prefer Black, although White's extra space may offset his inferior structure. This is a lot better than what White got in the game.

**15...Ba6 16.h4?!**

There are limitations to human effort. If you are on a false path with no way to make it better, all the hard work in the world is of no help. This attack looks too slow. White played his last move under the philosophy - To not take action when your back is pressed to the wall, is in a way, indirect suicide.

White should opt for a slightly inferior ending after 16.Qd2 .

Also, the wild lunge 16.g5 is easily tamed with 16...Ne7 .

**16...Nb4!**

Pressuring both the d3-bishop and the c2-pawn.

**17.Qd2**

It's an awful feeling to be full of rage and yet have nobody to yell at. At last, White grudgingly rearranges his plans to shifting circumstances.

QUESTION: How would we play if White just went for it with 17.g5 ? --- ANSWER: White's attack is unsound after 17...Rc8 18.gxh6 Rxh6 19.Ng5 . Notice that the h6-rook conveniently covers the e6-pawn. After 19...Rxc2+ 20.Ke3 Rc7 21.Bxa6 Nc2+ 22.Kf3 Nxa1 , White is down heavy material and an attack is nowhere to be found, since 23.Rc1?? is met with 23...Qa3+ .

**17...Rc8 18.Ne1**

White is in full retreat mode. --- EXERCISE (combination alert): Black has a forcing variation which leads to a rook and pawn ending a pawn up. What does he need to do?

The naive 18.g5?? is met with 18...Rxc2 .

**18...Ke7**

This move isn't so bad. I suspect Vallejo saw the combination but thought connecting his rooks was even stronger.

ANSWER: In a heartbeat, I would have gone for 18...Rxc2! (pin/simplification) 19.Nxc2 Bxd3+ 20.Ke3 Nxc2+ 21.Kxd3 Qxd2+ 22.Kxd2 Nxa1 23.Rxa1 Ke7 24.Rc1 Kd7 and Black's clean extra pawn should be decisive.

**19.Ke3?!**

Our pride tends to rebel at any admission of weakness or error.

White had to enter an inferior ending after 19.Rb1 Nxd3 20.Qxa5 Nf4+ 21.Ke3 bxa5 22.Kxf4 Rc4 23.Ke3 Rhc8 .

**19...Bxd3 20.cxd3 Qa4**

Black applies paralyzing pressure after 20...Qa3! 21.Rb1 Rc3! 22.f3 Rhc8 23.Qb2 a5 .

**21.a3 Nc6 22.Qb2 h5!**

Light-square weaknesses percolate through White's camp.

**23.gxh5**

The alternatives look worse: 23.f3? f6! 24.exf6+ gxf6 and White's king looks terribly exposed.

23.g5 seals the kingside. Black is in effect up a pawn after 23...Rc7 .

**23...Rxh5 24.f4 Kd7!**

A multipurpose move: 1. Black's king heads for the safety of b7. --- 2. Black intends ...Ne7, heading for the f5-hole.

**25.Nf3 Ne7 26.Rac1 Nf5+ 27.Kf2 Rhh8 28.h5?!**

EXERCISE (combination alert): White's last move was a mistake in an already very difficult position. How did Vallejo pick off a pawn?

White had to try 28.Rhg1 Rxc1 29.Rxc1 Rc8 30.Rxc8 Kxc8 with a difficult ending, being tied down as well as in effect, a pawn down, since his kingside majority is useless.

**28...g6!**

ANSWER: Deflection.

**29.h6**

29.hxg6?? Rxh1 30.Rxh1 Rc2+ wins White's queen.

29.Rxc8 Rxc8 30.Ne1 (covering the c2-pawn) 30...Rh8! dooms the h-pawn.

**29...Rxh6 30.Rxc8 Kxc8 31.Rc1+ Kb7 32.Qc3**

Threat: Mate on c8.

**32...Qd7**

Black consolidates a clean pawn up with the superior structure.

**33.a4 Rh8**

The rook heads for c8 to swap itself away.

**34.a5**

This just drops another pawn but I have no good suggestions for White at this stage.

**34...Rc8 35.a6+**

Praying for back rank tricks later on but this hangs another pawn.

Simplification is hopeless for White. After 35.Qxc8+ Qxc8 36.Rxc8 ( 36.a6+ Kb8 37.Rxc8+ Kxc8 38.Ke2 Kc7 39.Kd2 b5 40.Ng5 Nh6 and a6 falls ) 36...Kxc8 37.axb6 a5! 38.Ke2 Kb7 , White is hopelessly busted.

**35...Kb8 36.Qa3**

This was White's idea: Retain queens and hope for counterplay based on Black's shaky king, which as it turns out, isn't so shaky.

**36...Rxc1 37.Qxc1 Qa4**

A double attack on the a6- and d4-pawns.

**38.Ng5 Qa2+**

Black can also simplify with 38...Qxa6 39.Nxf7 Qxd3 40.Nd6 Qxd4+ 41.Kf3 Qc5 .

**39.Kg1**

The flabby king, having neglected exercise his entire life, is no match in hand to hand combat against Black's Amazon queen. White's defensive resolve isn't sufficient to shield his king from grievous injury and the only thing more unpleasant than his present is his future.

**39...Nxd4**

Threatening a fork on e2, while frustrating White, who is dying to play Qc6.

**40.Qe3 Nf5 41.Qh3 Qb1+!**

More ruthless than 41...Qxa6 which also wins easily.

**42.Kg2**

No choice since 42.Qf1 Qxf1+ 43.Kxf1 b5 44.Nxf7 b4 45.Ke2 Kc7 46.Ng5 Nd4+ 47.Kd2 Kb6 is totally hopeless for White.

**42...Qc2+ 43.Kg1**

The king's impromptu dance steps fall short of John Travolta boogying to the Bee Gees.

**43...Qd1+ 44.Kf2 Qd2+**

The queen regards White's king as a singularly repellent child, desperately in need of a spanking. "I advise you to choose your next words carefully," she warns him in a dangerous tone.

**45.Kg1**

The nervous king, inching closer to the kingside, displays signs of restlessness similar to a falsely imprisoned man in the Bastille.

**45...Qe1+ 46.Kg2 Nh4+! 47.Kh2**

There is nothing like being encircled by an armed mob to get one's heart pumping to capacity.

**47...Qf2+ 48.Kh1**

EXERCISE (combination alert): This one is not so hard. White's king is in a box. He seeks escape, the way a five-year-old wriggles to undo an aunt's embrace. How does Black generate an unstoppable threat? --- ANSWER: Two inert chemicals, when fused and compounded, can suddenly transform into a combustible concoction. There is no reasonable defence to the coming ...Ng3+.

**48...Nf5! 49.Qh8+**

The queen attempts to empty her mind on the sordid reflection of her infinitely more powerful sister and channels it into sweet thoughts of revenge on Black's solitary king. Unfortunately her attempts to stir up a perpetual check turn out to be uniformly futile.

In any case, after 49.Qg2 Qxf4 50.Nf3 g5! , it's time for White to resign.

**49...Kc7 50.Nxe6+**

It's difficult when you are unable to repay your debts. Even worse is when you can't even afford to make payments on the interest. The perpetual check attempt reminds me of the time when I, suffused with iron logic, challenged my first grade teacher Mrs. Kelly by declaring that "2x2 can't be 4, since that is the same answer as 2+2."

**50...fxe6 51.Qh7+ Kc6 52.Qb7+ Kb5 53.Qd7+**

"God willing, I shall rule by divine decree," pronounces White's queen. As it turns out, God isn't all that willing.

**53...Ka5**

. The checks end. --- SUMMARY: One great benefit of the 11...cxd4 plan is its rarity. Your opponents will most certainly be thrown off by it. Also, it is very likely sound, since it scores (so far!) very well for Black. Moreover, a pair of Elo 2700+ GMs, Vallejo Pons and Nepomniachtchi, endorsed it.

0-1

### (62)Inarkiev, E.   --   Nepomniachtchi, I. 42: Siberian Bank Cup, Novosibirsk  2012   0-1   C12 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.e5 h6 6.Bd2 Bxc3 7.bxc3 Ne4 8.Qg4 Kf8 9.Bd3 Nxd2 10.Kxd2 c5 11.Nf3 cxd4 12.Nxd4**

This time, White refuses to fix his structure, preferring to use d4 as an outpost for his knight. My feeling is this line is superior to 12 cxd4, which we examined in the previous game.

**12...Qg5+!**

QUESTION: Here we go again. What is the criterion of when it's okay for us to make this swap? --- ANSWER: Essentially, you must consider these two points: 1. If Black isn't too far behind in development and can later connect rooks, then the swap tends to be good for Black. --- 2. Much more importantly, White must be restricted or at least contained, from game-opening ideas like h4 and f4.

An alternative line is 12...Nd7 13.Qf4 Nc5 14.Nb3 b6 15.h4 , W.Espinoza Palomino-J.Oms Pallisse, Havana 2011. Play may continue 15...Qc7 16.Rh3 Kg8 17.Nd4 Bd7 18.Rf3 Be8 . Now if White presses on with 19.g4 g6! 20.h5 g5 21.Qe3 Kg7 22.Re1 Rc8 23.Rg3 Rg8 24.f4 gxf4 25.Qxf4 Nxd3 26.Rxd3 Kh7 , I prefer Black's superior structure to White's attacking chances, mainly since White's king doesn't appear all that safe here.

**13.Qxg5 hxg5**

QUESTION: You said not to play ...Qg5+ when Black is too far behind in development, yet here, Black's development is at zero and White seems to be three tempi ahead! Why is this position an exception? --- ANSWER: This position is an exception because of part II of the contract - White can't easily open the game, so Black is still okay.

**14.h3**

QUESTION: Why not the immediate 14.g4 to lock the g-pawn down? --- ANSWER: Probably White was nervous about loss of control - even if temporary - over the h3-pawn. Your suggestion is playable but Houdini's analysis suggests Black remains at least even at the end of the variation. After 14...Bd7 15.Rab1 b6 16.Nf3 Nc6 17.Rbe1 Ke7! 18.h4 ( 18.Nxg5? is met with 18...Nxe5! 19.Rxe5 f6 20.Re2 fxg5 when Black wins a pawn ) 18...gxh4 19.Nxh4 d4 20.Nf3 dxc3+ 21.Kxc3 Na5 , Black doesn't stand worse. His superior structure is at least as meaningful as White's extra space.

**14...Nd7!**

QUESTION: Why not play the knight to the more aggressive c6-square? --- ANSWER: Actually, the move played is more aggressive, since the knight's destination is the more ambitious c5-square.

**15.Rae1 Nc5 16.Rhf1**

Preparing f4. This attack would be scary if queens remained on the board. But in this case, I have confidence in Black's defensive resources, since his position remains virtually weakness-free.

QUESTION: Can White take advantage of his temporary lead in development by prying open the black king's position with 16.Nf3 f6 17.h4 g4 18.Nd4 Bd7 19.f3 ? --- ANSWER: Black's king looks okay to me after 19...gxf3 20.gxf3 Ke7 21.f4 f5 22.h5 Rh7 23.Rh2 Rc8 and if 24.Nf3 Be8 25.Reh1 . The h5-pawn is at least as weak as the g7-pawn and White must also worry about ...Na4 and ...Ne4 tricks.

**16...Bd7 17.f4**

White achieves his objective but it isn't as effective as he hoped, since Black caught up in development.

**17...gxf4 18.Rxf4 Ke7 19.Ref1 Raf8 20.Rg4 Rfg8 21.Nb3 Na4 22.Rb4 b6 23.Rff4 Nb2 24.Nd4 Nxd3!?**

Ah, yes, the free will versus predestination argument arises. Sometimes a conciliatory gesture is only for show and in actuality, cloaks intense ambition. --- QUESTION: It feels to me like Black continues with a principle-transgressing outrage: 1. Black's last move fixes White's damaged pawns. --- 2. Black virtually begs White to enter a good knight versus bad bishop ending. --- Hence, Black's outlook with his last move balances a compound of optimism and insufficient means. Therefore, White holds a clear plus, based on superior space and most importantly, the better minor piece. Am I correct in my assessment? --- ANSWER: I prefer Black. Declaring White's victory here is a bit like the historian who writes about world events which have yet to happen. --- QUESTION: On what do you base your rosy assessment for Black? --- ANSWER: Outwardly it does indeed appear that in a moment of puritanical self-reproach, Black broke all Ten Commandments and lapsed in all the seven deadly sins. But before we take White's inevitable victory for granted, let's examine the facts: First of all, I question your premise that Black's bishop is bad. I remind you of Tartakower's quip about the worst bishop still being better than the best knight! Only two of Black pawns are fixed on light squares - not enough to label the bishop as "bad". I envision it reaching e4, after ...f6, ...Be8 and ...Bg6, which happens routinely in French structures.

Black also looks okay after 24...Na4 25.Bb5 g5 26.Rf3 Nc5 27.Bxd7 Nxd7 28.Nc6+ Ke8 29.Ke3 g4! 30.Rxg4 Rxg4 31.hxg4 Rh1 32.Rh3 Re1+ 33.Kd2 Rg1 34.Rh8+ Nf8 35.Nxa7 Rxg2+ .

**25.cxd3 Rh5 26.Nf3 f6 27.Rh4 Rgh8 28.Rxh5 Rxh5 29.Rg4 Kf7 30.d4**

A classic good knight versus bad bishop position? I'm not so sure. Black's bishop shouldn't be underestimated.

**30...Be8 31.h4 Rh7 32.Rf4**

Threatening a delightfully lowbrow cheapo on g5.

**32...Ke7**

Sidestepping the cheapo and clearing the g6-square for the bishop.

**33.g4 Bg6**

Free at last, free at last.

**34.exf6+**

I think this resolution of central tension doesn't hurt Black.

**34...gxf6 35.g5**

White hopes to crystallize the structure where Black's pawns are frozen on d5 and e6. Even so, Black's bishop isn't hindered in the least by it.

**35...Bf5 36.Ke3**

Continuing to play for the win.

If White wants a draw, he has it with 36.c4 dxc4 37.d5 fxg5 38.Nxg5 Rh5 39.dxe6 Bxe6 40.Re4 Rh6 41.a4 Kd6 42.Nxe6 Rxe6 43.Rxe6+ Kxe6 44.Kc3 Kf5 45.Kxc4 a6 46.Kd5 Kg4 47.Kc6 b5 .

**36...Rh8**

Worrying White about ...Rc8.

**37.Kd2 fxg5 38.Nxg5 Kf6 39.Nf3**

There is a loose feeling to White's position and I continue to prefer Black. White must watch out for infiltration attempts by Black's rook and even his king.

**39...a5 40.Kc1 Rg8 41.Ng5 Kg6!**

The h5-square is an ideal outpost for the king where it ties White's rook to defence of the h4-pawn.

**42.Kb2 Kh5 43.Kb3 Rg7 44.a4?!**

QUESTION: Can White's king go raiding with 44.Ka4 Rc7 45.Kb5 ? --- ANSWER: I think your suggestion is a good plan, since it reduces the number of pawns on the board. White should hold the balance after 45...Rxc3 46.Kxb6 Ra3 ( 46...a4 47.Rf3 Rc2 48.Ra3 Rc4 49.Re3 Kxh4 50.Nxe6 Kg4 51.Nc7 Rxd4 52.Re5 Be4 53.Nxd5! Bxd5 54.Kc5 Rd2 55.Rxd5 Rxa2 56.Kb4 is also drawn ) 47.Rf3 Rxa2 48.Re3 Kxh4 49.Nxe6 Be4 50.Kc5 a4 51.Nc7 Rc2+ 52.Kd6 Rd2 53.Ke5 Rd3 54.Rxd3 Bxd3 55.Nxd5 a3 56.Nb4 Bc4 57.d5 Bxd5 and the draw is reached.

**44...Rc7 45.Nf3 Rg7 46.Ng5 Bg4 47.c4!?**

47.Rf7! Bd1+ 48.Ka3 Rxf7 49.Nxf7 Kxh4 50.Ne5 Kg5 51.Nd7 Kf4 52.Nxb6 Ke4 53.Nd7 Kd3 54.Kb2 Kd2 ( 54...Bxa4?? hangs the bishop to 55.Nc5+ ) 55.Nc5 Bc2 56.Nxe6 Bxa4 and the position is drawn.

**47...Bd1+**

Black can press harder with 47...Rc7 48.cxd5 exd5 49.Kb2 Kxh4 50.Nf7 Kg3 51.Rf6 Bd1 52.Ne5 Rc2+ 53.Kb1 Rd2 54.Kc1 Rxd4 55.Nc6 Rd3 56.Ne5 Re3 57.Kxd1 Rxe5 58.Kd2! Re4 59.Rxb6 Rxa4 60.Rd6 d4 61.Kd3 Kf3 62.Rxd4 and a truce can be declared.

**48.Kc3 Rc7 49.c5 Bg4**

EXERCISE (critical decision): It can be painful to witness another's happiness, when contrasting it to our own suffering. White suffers twin agonies, since both the c5- and h4- pawns hang. Things look pretty grim from White's perspective. Yet White has a hidden path to navigate his way out of the labyrinth of pain. Analyse 50 Rf6, going after the e6-pawn, and 50 Rf7. Only one of them draws. Which one would you play?

**50.Rf6??**

Do we choose our sufferings, or are they simply thrust upon us by a cruel universe? Are we not all subject to such strange detours of the mind, from time to time? The rook shows up to the duel both swordless and pistolless. In time pressure, reflective thought is vacuumed away, to be replaced by emotion and guesswork. White makes the text move based on a hallucination, since the e6-pawn isn't really hanging.

ANSWER: White holds the draw with 50.Rf7! Rc6 51.Rh7+ Kg6 52.Ra7 bxc5 53.Rxa5 cxd4+ 54.Kxd4 Kh5 55.Rc5 Ra6 56.a5 Kxh4 57.Nf7 with an iron dark-square blockade and a stifling passed a-pawn. White easily holds the draw a pawn down.

**50...Kxh4 51.Nf7**

The knight remains gun-shy, with good reason.

51.Nxe6?? loses instantly to 51...Rc6 , when White's king is visibly irked by what he considers the monumental incompetence of his key advisors, namely, his rook and knight.

**51...bxc5**

Black is up two pawns and the rest, as we annotators love to write, is "a matter of technique".

**52.Rh6+ Kg3 53.Ne5**

Cheapo threat: Rg6.

**53...Bf5 54.Rh8 Kf4 55.Rh1 cxd4+ 56.Kxd4 Rc2**

Threat: ...Ra2. This in turn forces White's rook into a passive stance on a1.

**57.Rf1+ Kg5 58.Ra1 Kf6 59.Nd7+ Ke7 60.Ne5**

EXERCISE (planning): Black is up two pawns but as we all realize, games don't win themselves. Come up with a clear winning plan for Black. --- ANSWER: Pawn sac.

**60...Re2!**

Threat: ...Re4+. The blockade is broken, and as we soon see, the loss of the a5-pawn is irrelevant.

**61.Nc6+ Kd6 62.Nxa5 e5+ 63.Kc3 d4+**

All with tempo gain. The race really isn't a race, since Black remains miles ahead.

**64.Kc4 Be6+ 65.Kd3 Re3+ 66.Kd2 Bd5!**

Who dares call this upstanding member of society "bad" now? White's stalemated knight now realizes the glib bishop is not to be trusted. Up until now, the knight monopolized the conversation. Now it's the bishop's turn to speak as the stranded knight's shortcomings are now quite apparent to all.

**67.Rb1**

White has no choice but to play this as it is the only way to give the rook some play.

**67...Ra3 68.Rb6+ Kd7 69.Rb4**

Now that both the white rook and knight are humbled for all to see, people notice that their once imperious gazes have oddly softened.

**69...Ke6 70.Nc4 Bxc4**

Simplification is the rule when winning. The rook and pawn ending is an easy win, since Black is faster.

**71.Rxc4 Kd5 72.Rb4 e4 73.Kc2 e3 74.Rb8 Rc3+ 75.Kd1 Ke4**

"There is nothing more amusing than a coward, feigning nonchalance," says Black's obnoxious king, with a laugh, at the expense of his d1-brother.

**76.a5 Ra3 77.Kc2**

White's king, a gentleman of leisure, realizes that of late, the "leisure" part of his title seems to be missing.

**77...d3+**

. SUMMARY: Despite appearances, I think Black gets a reasonable version of the ending after 11...Qg5+! and we stand dynamically even. Also, note that Black won with the services of his much maligned bad bishop, which in so many French games, isn't really so bad as its awful reputation.

0-1

### (63)Shukh, N.   --   Najer, E. 43: Russian Championship, Dagomys  2010   0-1   C12 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.e5 h6 6.Bd2 Bxc3 7.bxc3 Ne4 8.Qg4 Kf8**

White's queen smiles expectantly at Black's uncomfortable king, who writhes inwardly at her unwanted advances.

**9.Bd3 Nxd2 10.Kxd2 c5 11.h4**

White cuts out annoying ...Qg5+ ideas. --- QUESTION: But doesn't 11 Nf3 do exactly that, while developing a piece? --- ANSWER: True, but there is one fundamental difference between the moves. With 11 h4, White keeps the f3-square open for a rook lift via h3. The lines can easily transpose, but in the case of 11 h4, White seeks to keep the rook lift option open.

**11...c4!?**

Korchnoi's favourite plan, in conjunction with his pet 8...Kf8. As mentioned earlier in the chapter, Black deliberately violates the principle: Don't close the centre when attacked on the wing, for the following reasons: 1. Black chases away White's dangerous light-squared bishop from its best diagonal (although it can crop up on h5 and g4 later). --- 2. Black closes the queenside, mainly because this is where Black plans to run his king, as soon as he stabilizes his kingside. --- QUESTION: Can we trick White by first playing 11...Nc6 and on 12 Nf3, then we play 12...c4. In this way, we can move-order White into blocking f3 with a knight, denying the Rh3-f3 lift?

ANSWER: Well, your trick works if White follows up 11...Nc6 12.Nf3 ( but we simply transpose if White plays 12.Rh3! . )

QUESTION: Can Black go for the plan with ...cxd4 as in the previous two games? --- ANSWER: Let's have a look at 11...cxd4 12.cxd4 . One thing that makes me suspicious is that there is only a single game in the database. ( 12...Bd7 13.Rh3 h5?! I would have held off on this move, which allows White use of the g5-square later on. Following 14.Qf4 Nc6 15.Rf3 Be8 16.Nh3 Qb6 17.Ng5 Nd8 , A.Malashenko-I.Rajlich, Frydek Mistek 1997. White looks clearly better after 18.Ke2 . ) ( 12...Qa5+ 13.c3 Nc6 14.Ne2 and here is one difference which favours White - the knight gets to e2, which is a superior square to f3 since on e2, it covers White's weakness on c3. After 14...b6 15.Rh3 Qa3 16.Ke1 Ba6 17.Bxa6 Qxa6 18.Rf3 (threat: Qxe6) 18...Qc8 19.Nf4 Rh7 20.Kf1 ( 20.Nxe6+?? hangs a piece to 20...Kg8 ) 20...Qd7 , maybe this is still playable for Black but it looks to me like an inferior version of the previous two games. I prefer White here. )

**12.Be2**

I don't see the point of going all the way back to f1, yet strong GMs have played the move. For example, 12.Bf1 Nc6 13.Ne2 b5 14.a3 a5 15.Rh3 : ( 15...Bd7 16.Nf4 Rg8 17.Rf3 Ke7 18.Nh5 , P.Leko-V.Korchnoi, Essen 2002. Here I would play 18...Qf8 and then run the king to c7, with a decent position. ) ( 15...Rg8 16.Nf4 Ne7 17.Rf3 Nf5 18.Qh3 , J.Polgar-V.Korchnoi, Zurich 2006. At this point Korchnoi could have played 18...g5!? 19.hxg5 hxg5 20.g4 Nh4 21.Nh5 Nxf3+ 22.Qxf3 Rg6 23.Nf6 and White has full compensation for the exchange but no more. For example, after 23...Rh6 24.Be2 Ke7 25.Qe3 Rg6 26.Rh1 Qf8 27.Rh7 Rg7 28.Rh5 Bb7 29.Rxg5 Kd8 30.Rh5 Kc7 31.Qh6 b4 32.axb4 axb4 , Houdini rates at 0.00, while I would still take Black if given a choice. ( ) )

**12...b5**

Black can choose to eschew the queenside advance with 12...Nc6 13.Rh3 Rg8 14.Qf4 Bd7 15.Bh5 (this move is why I prefer 12 Be2 over 12 Bf1) 15...Be8 16.Ne2 f5!? : ( . Anand criticized his 17.g4!? move and following 17...Ne7 18.Rg1 Bxh5 19.gxh5 Qe8 20.Qf3 Rc8! , the rook prepares to lift to c6, where it covers the e6-pawn and menaces ...Ra6 as well. The game continued 21.Nf4 Rc6 22.Rhg3 Ra6 23.Qg2 Qf7 24.Qf1! Qe8 ( 24...Rxa2?? allows White to infiltrate on the other side of the board after 25.Qb1 Ra6 26.Qxb7 Rb6 27.Qa8+ Qe8 28.Qxa7 Qb8 29.Qd7 and Black can resign since 29...Qc8 is met with 30.Ng6+ ) 25.R1g2 Kf7 26.Rg1 Rxa2 27.Qg2 Qf8 28.Rb1 Qc8 29.Rg1 and a draw was agreed as neither side could make progress, V.Anand-V.Korchnoi, Dos Hermanas 1999. ) ( 17.exf6?? is completely unsound. Black easily consolidates after 17...Bxh5 18.fxg7+ Kxg7 19.Rg3+ Kh7 . ) ( . Anand recommended 17.Bxe8! and after 17...Kxe8 18.g4 Ne7 19.Rg1 , White has some kingside pressure though Black's game looks defendable here after 19...Kd7 . )

**13.Rh3 Nc6 14.Rg3**

Here is an example from Korchnoi: Move by Move: 14.a3 a5 15.Qf4 Ra7 16.Bh5 Qe7 17.Rg3 Rh7!? has the Trappist monk on h7 shatter his decade long vow of silence by laughing uncontrollably in the attackers' faces. Neglecting to reveal information to one who needs it is a kind of lie by omission. Only Korchnoi understands the motivation behind this bizarre move. Following 18.Rf3 Ke8 19.Qg3 g6 20.Rf6! (the hanging bishop isn't really hanging) 20...b4 21.Bd1 ! h5 22.Nh3 Kd8 23.Nf4 Bd7 24.Qg5 bxc3+ 25.Ke3 Rc7! , he sets up a dirty tactical trick in typical Korchnoi counterpunching style with 26.Nxh5 gxh5!! , and White has to accept the rook and the chaos that follow with ( 26...Rxh5? leads to White's advantage and to find out why, I strongly urge you to immediately order multiple copies of this excellent book! ) 27.Qg8+ Be8 28.Qxh7 Nxd4 29.Kf4 with mind-numbing complications. Houdini rates this position at 0.00, V.Gashimov-V.Korchnoi, Dagomys 2008. Ah, yes, another routine day in the McCutcheon!

**14...Rg8 15.Qf4**

Clearing the way for Bh5. White constantly switches targets from g7 to f7 but Black has the resources to defend.

**15...Bd7**

Heading for e8.

**16.Bh5 Be8 17.Rf3 f5!**

Najer remembered Korchnoi's clever little device. --- QUESTION: What is so wonderful about achieving ...f5? It feels like we invite g4 ideas. --- ANSWER: The ...f5! thrust clears defensive space for Black, which generally overrides White's g4 counterplay.

If you don't want to play ...f5, you can always go for the plan of keeping the pawns where they are and walking the king to the queenside, like 17...Qc7 18.Ne2 Nd8 followed by ...Ke7, ...Kd7 and ...Kc8.

**18.Bxe8 Kxe8 19.h5 a5**

Black can also try the immediate 19...b4 20.cxb4 Qb6 21.Ne2 ( 21.c3?! a5 allows Black to favourably pry open the queenside ) 21...Qxb4+ , F.Pancevski-B.Maksimovic, Nis 2012. Now White can speculate with 22.Nc3 Qb6 23.Rb1!? Qxd4+ 24.Qxd4 Nxd4 . Houdini's analysis runs 25.Rg3 Rd8 26.Rg6 Rd7 27.Na4 Kf7 28.c3 Nc6 29.Nc5 Re7 30.Nb7 Rb8 ( 30...Nxe5?? 31.Nd6+ Kf8 32.Rb8+ mate! ) 31.Nd6+ Kg8 32.Rxb8+ Nxb8 33.Ke3 Nd7 34.Nc8 Re8 35.Nd6 with a draw by repetition of moves.

**20.g4**

Both sides play on their respective wings and the game looks dynamically balanced to me.

**20...Rf8 21.Nh3?!**

After this move, White suddenly stands worse.

The knight looks better on e2, since after 21.Ne2 b4 , it covers both the c3-and d4-pawns (which are sensitive points).

**21...b4**

Both sides achieved their thematic breaks.

**22.Rd1**

Perhaps White should go for quicker play with 22.g5 hxg5 23.Nxg5 Qe7 24.Rg1 Ra7 .

**22...bxc3+ 23.Ke1?**

Necessary was 23.Rxc3 Rb8 24.g5 Rh8 .

**23...Qh4!**

White's previous recklessness and his present woes display a clear degree of convergence. This move short-circuits White's kingside initiative.

**24.g5**

No real choice, since 24.gxf5?? loses to 24...Qxh5 25.f6 g5 26.Qg3 g4 and Black wins a piece.

**24...Qxh5 25.Rxc3 Rb8**

Black has a winning position and White's kingside initiative is nowhere to be seen.

**26.a3 Kd7 27.Rg3 Ne7 28.Kd2**

Black is up a pawn and holds all structural trumps. He believes an exchange of queens would benefit him, so he forces them off the board. As it turns out, the position isn't so easy to win since Black must deal with fortress issues (due to the blocked nature of the position).

**28...Ng6!? 29.Qf3**

29.Qe3 f4 30.Qf3 Qxf3 31.Rxf3 Nh4 32.Rc3 h5 is even worse for White than in the game continuation.

**29...Qxf3 30.Rxf3 h5**

Creating a passed h-pawn, which also happens to be an extra one.

**31.Rg1 Rb2 32.Ra1**

32.Kc3? Ra2 33.Kd2 Rb8 34.Rc3 Rbb2 leaves White horribly tangled up.

**32...Rb7 33.Rc3 f4!?**

I like this move which opens possibilities of a king infiltration via g6 and f5.

Houdini disapproves, yet when I played out its suggested moves, it had difficulty making progress after 33...Rfb8 34.Re3 Rb2 35.Ree1 R8b7 36.Rh1 h4 37.Kc3 Rb8 38.Kd2 Kc6 39.Kc3 a4 40.Kd2 R8b3 41.Kc1 Rb7 42.Kd2 . The comp keeps evaluating at a whopping -1.73, yet can't find a way to convert.

**34.Ng1**

White hopes to bring the knight back to a better square.

**34...Rf5 35.Nf3 Rb8**

Idea: ...Rh8 and ...h4.

**36.Rh1 Rh8 37.a4 Rff8 38.Ra3 Rb8**

QUESTION: It feels like Black keeps changing plans, from kingside to queenside. Why does he vacillate? --- ANSWER: It's deliberate. Principle: When one party defends weaknesses on both sides of the board, keep switching from wing to wing, since it is much more difficult for the defence to calibrate against the changing threats.

**39.Kc1 Rb4 40.Ra1 Ke8**

Perhaps Black dreams of a future king infiltration via g6 and f5.

**41.c3 Rb3 42.Kc2 Kf7 43.Rab1!**

A pair of rooks off the board can only help White here.

**43...Rxb1 44.Kxb1 Ne7**

Freeing up the g6-square for the king, that is, if White does not impede it.

**45.Nh4**

Forced,

as 45.Kc2?? Kg6 46.Kd2 Kf5 is hopeless for White.

**45...Ng6 46.Nf3 Ne7**

The more White demands his opponent to hurry, the more Black engages in delaying tactics.

**47.Nh4 Rb8+ 48.Kc2 Rb3**

48...Ng6 49.Nf3 h4 50.Rh2 Rh8 51.Rh3 Ke7 52.Kd2 Kd7 53.Ke2 Ke7 54.Kd2 and Houdini couldn't manage a breakthrough into White's fortress from here.

**49.Rg1**

49.g6+! Nxg6 50.Nf3 h4 51.Rg1 Rb7 52.Rg4 and I don't see a way for Black to make progress.

**49...g6**

49...Ra3 50.Kb2 and if Black plays 50...Rxa4? , his rook will never get to move again.

**50.Rh1 Nc6**

White has the opportunity to force rooks off the board with 51 Rb1. Should he take it or should he decline and continue with a holding pattern? Not an easy decision. It appears to me that if White retained rooks on the board, it would be easier for him to draw the game.

**51.Rb1**

51.Ng2! f3 52.Nf4 and I don't see a way for Black to make progress without taking excessive risks.

**51...Rxb1 52.Kxb1**

Out of nothingness, White managed to produce an unbreachable fortress, which doesn't seem to have a beginning, middle or end. Black does his best to make progress with a multi-step plan: Step 1: Transfer the knight to f7, where it attacks the g5-pawn and ties White's knight to the f3-square.

**52...Nd8! 53.Kc2 Kg7 54.Kd2 Nf7 55.Nf3**

Step 2: White's knight is overloaded so Black's h-pawn is free to move forward.

**55...h4! 56.Ke2**

56.Nxh4?? Nxg5 57.f3 Kh6 58.Ke2 Kh5 59.Ng2 Nh3 60.Ke1 g5 61.Kf1 g4 62.Ne1 Ng5 63.fxg4+ Kxg4 and the game is over, since ...Ne4 comes next.

**56...h3 57.Kf1 Nd8!**

EXERCISE (critical decision/planning): Black intends to manoeuvre his knight to b6 and then pick off the a4-pawn. White has a choice of two reactions: Plan A - Transfer White's king to h3 and then pick off Black's h- and f-pawns. When Black's knight wins the a4-pawn, he will cover the c3-pawn with Nd2 and Nb1. --- Plan B - White's king can reach the a3-square, protecting a4 before Black's knight has a chance to get to b6. So this means White's knight is left to guard against the advance of Black's passed h-pawn. One plan draws; the other loses. Consider carefully, since this one isn't so easy to solve. This is a position more suited to precise calculation, rather than carefree rapture (although even if you do take a wild guess, you still have a 50% chance of getting it right!). Which direction should White's king go? Left or right?

**58.Ke2?**

Like most kings, this one isn't used to taking orders. The white king's tenure as leading dissident was a short one. Previously, move followed move without event. But this last move throws White's world out of its orderly routine. The king weaves left, when he should go right.

ANSWER: White draws in fortress mode with 58.Kg1! Nc6 59.Kh2 Nb8 60.Kxh3 Nd7 61.Kg4 Nb6 62.Nd2 Nxa4 63.Nb1 Kf8 64.Kxf4 and an air of desolation hangs over Black's now nearly tenentless kingside pawns. After 64...Ke7 65.Ke3 Kd7 66.f3 Kc6 67.Kd2 Nb2 68.Na3 Nd3 69.Ke3 a4 70.Nc2 Kb5 , Black's king has no queenside entry, unless the precious a-pawn is sac'ed. Following 71.Na3+ Ka5 72.Nc2 , White can't make progress, even if Black attempts the desperado 72...a3!? 73.Nxa3 Ka4 74.Nc2 Kb3 75.Kd2 Kb2 76.Ne3 Nf4 77.Nd1+ Kb3 78.Nf2 (covering against ...Nh3) 78...Kb2 79.Nd1+ Kb3 80.Nf2 Nh5 81.Ng4 Kb2 82.Nf6 Ng3 83.f4 Nf1+ 84.Ke2 Ng3+ 85.Kd2! ( 85.Kf3?? loses to 85...Nf5 when c3 falls ) 85...Nf1+ 86.Ke2 Ng3+ 87.Kd2 , the game will end in a draw.

**58...Nc6 59.Kd2 Ne7 60.Kc2 Nc8 61.Kb2 Nb6 62.Ka3**

EXERCISE (planning/combination alert): When a magician performs a trick before an audience of children, he knows it is merely illusion, while the children may believe it to be real. White's king arrived just in the nick of time and all looks well for the defenders. This isn't the reality and White soon discovers he must restrain premature jubilation. If we closely dissect White's happiness, we come to realize he has little cause for it. Black forced a win here. How? --- ANSWER: Overloaded defender. Transfer the knight to h7, after which White is helpless against the overload trick ...Nxg5!.

**62...Nd7!**

Sometimes, out of the blue, Caissia waves her hand and blesses us with a hidden gift. The knight returns to the kingside for an encore.

**63.Kb2**

White's king hopes this is simply a bad dream, from which he will soon awaken.

**63...Nf8 64.Kc2**

The king remains silent and his guilt remains more audible than his voice.

**64...Nh7!**

This is a perfect example of the principle we discussed earlier: When one party defends weaknesses on both sides of the board, keep switching from wing to wing, since it is much more difficult for the defence to calibrate against the changing threats. In this instance, White's king is just too slow to reach the kingside and White is helpless against the coming combination.

**65.Kd2 Nxg5!**

. If something bothered you for a long time, speaking your mind on the issue can be a cathartic experience. The oversight committee is comprised of only one member who matters - Black's knight. White's kingside is disgorged of all able-bodied defenders. If I remember my high school Euclidean geometry correctly, you can divide a parcel of space in half and then subdivide the halves in half, ad infinitum. To White, who seems to be losing territory at an alarming rate, this theory rings true. A second pawn falls and the blockade is smashed, since Black's king is free to enter the kingside. --- SUMMARY: On 11 h4, let's go with 11...c4, since the 11...cxd4 plan doesn't work as well versus White's 11 h4 move-order. Also, when White's bishop is on h5 and ours sits on e8, remember Korchnoi's tricky ...f5! idea, which clears defensive space for our side.

A rare move, over the normal 13...b5. --- QUESTION: Why protect the g7-pawn before it is even attacked? After all, White will probably focus on the f7-pawn. --- ANSWER: Korchnoi protects the g7-pawn in preparation for a king run to the queenside (although in this game, his king never quite got that far!).

**14.Rf3**

This is new in the position.

More commonly played is 14.Qf4 Bd7 15.Bh5 Be8 16.Ne2 f5! , V.Anand-V.Korchnoi, Dos Hermanas 1999, which we already examined in the notes of the previous game, Shukh-Najer.

**14...Ke7 15.Nh3**

15.Qf4 will be met with 15...Qf8 . --- QUESTION: Can you show an example of how Black would run his king to the queenside? --- ANSWER: Play might proceed 16.h5 b5 17.g4 Bd7 18.Nh3 Rb8 19.a3 Be8 20.g5 hxg5 21.Nxg5 Rh8 22.Qg4 Qg8 23.Rg1 Kd7 24.Nh3 Rh7 25.h6 Rxh6 26.Qxg7 Qxg7 27.Rxg7 Nd8 28.Ng5 Ke7 29.Rh7 Rxh7 30.Nxh7 Rb6 (going after the a3-pawn) 31.Kc1 with an equal position.

**15...Qa5!?**

It's not easy to escape our true nature, as displayed by Korchnoi's reverence - one may call it obsession - with inflicting chaos in virtually every game he plays. He indulges in provocation merrily. Most players would consider it necessary to take precautions but Korchnoi always seems to go his own way as he wilfully neglects to do so. This move in reality deserves a "?!" mark, but not when it's Korchnoi, who like Lasker before him, thrives on confusing opponents with slightly unsound ideas! --- QUESTION: What is so strange about this move? --- ANSWER: Two things come to mind: 1. In this structure, Black normally leaves the a5-square open for the a-pawn to break with ...a5 and eventually ...b4. --- 2. Only a very confident defender would deliberately move his queen away from the kingside, with White massing in that sector. --- QUESTION: It feels like playing the queen to a5 is pointless for Black. What benefit is derived? --- ANSWER: Korchnoi, a notorious pawn grabber, perhaps contemplates tying White's rook to defence of the a2-pawn. Also, he may entertain ideas like ...Qb5 and ...Qb2, chasing White's rook from a1 and then grabbing the a2-pawn. Of course, this takes time and Black may well get mated on the other side of the board in the meanwhile. However, this is just how Korchnoi operates, always provoking and always stretching limits. Only a player endowed with phenomenal calculating ability can get away with this kind of idea.

15...Bd7 is a far saner choice!

**16.Qf4 Rf8 17.Rg3 Rg8**

Players who must win every game (Korchnoi, Larsen and Fischer come to mind) are greatly admired for their fighting spirit. I always regard a chess player with an overdeveloped competitive urge as a character flaw (although this hippy, love-and-light philosophy may be one reason I'm not a GM)! In this case, we see Korchnoi mellowing with age, satisfied with a draw with the Black pieces. However, his young, ambitious opponent isn't intimidated by the fact that the tournament in which he participates is named after his legendary opponent!

**18.Bh5 Nd8 19.Re1!?**

I suspect this is exactly the reaction Korchnoi intended to provoke when he tauntingly played his queen to a5. White goes all in for his attack, not worrying about his a2-pawn.

Much safer was 19.a3! : ( . If Black plays the greedy 19...Qb5? intending ...Qb2, White can respond with 20.Re1 Qa4 21.Rxg7! (this shot has been in the air for a while now) 21...Rxg7 22.Qf6+ Kf8 23.Qxh6!! and Black is curiously helpless. For example, after 23...Nc6 24.Ng5 Ne7 25.Bxf7 Ng8 26.Nh7+! Kxf7 27.Qf4+ Ke7 28.Qf8+ Kd7 29.Qxg7+ Ne7 30.Nf6+ Kd8 31.Qf8+ , White is winning. ( ) ) ( . Correct is 19...Ke8! removing Rxg7 tricks. I still like White's chances here. )

**19...b5!?**

I would play 19...Bd7 intending ...Be8.

**20.a3 Qxa3?**

Black's cavalier pawn grab is a move which virtually invokes punishing sanctions. The terms of transaction of this line of the McCutcheon clearly stipulate - guard your king before wandering off on some crazy adventure! This time, Korchnoi, who is just asking for it, gets the question mark. The mood is upon him and he proceeds in the same reckless manner as his previous moves. Black deliberately allows White the coming sacrificial breakthrough, betting on his queenside counterplay to balance the game. --- EXERCISE (combination alert): Black's greedy queen thinks back, hoping to unearth a past unselfish action and draws a blank. Find White's kingside breakthrough shot, which gives him an edge.

Much safer and probably better is 20...Rb8! : ( . If White goes all out with 21.Ree3? Ke8 22.Ref3 Rb7 when Black has everything covered, the a3-pawn hangs, and strangely enough, White has no good way to make progress on the kingside. ) ( . Necessary is 21.Ra1 when Black gets even chances after 21...b4 22.cxb4 Rxb4 23.c3 Rb2+ 24.Ke1 Qb6 25.Qc1 . ( ) )

**21.Rxg7!**

ANSWER: Double attack/demolition of king's structure. --- An exposed king is always pleasing to an attacker's palate. It appears as if the day of the rash black queen's reckoning has dawned.

**21...Rxg7 22.Qf6+**

The queen motions the king to take a seat on d7.

**22...Kd7**

22...Kf8?? is an unfortunately decision after 23.Qxd8# mate!

**23.Qxg7 b4**

EXERCISE (critical decision): Should White play 24 cxb4 or should he lift his rook into the attack with 24 Re3. A vaguely plausible strategy won't do here. One line leads to a winning position for White, while the other leaves him fighting for a draw.

**24.Re3?**

In this instance, the natural attacking move is incorrect and fails to address the core issue.

ANSWER: White should temporarily cede the initiative with the counterintuitive 24.cxb4! since Black's coming ...b3! must be prevented at any cost. After 24...Qb2! 25.Ke2! Qxc2+ 26.Kf1 Qd3+ 27.Kg1 , White's king rudely points the television remote control at Black's queen, frantically pressing buttons, in a channel-changing motion. Black is in serious trouble after 27...Qc3 28.Rd1 Qxb4 29.Nf4 Rb8 30.Qxh6 Rb6 31.Qh7! and if 31...c3 32.Bxf7 Nxf7 33.Qxf7+ Qe7 34.Qxe7+ Kxe7 35.Rc1 Rc6 36.h5 Kf7 37.g4 Kg7 38.g5 a5 39.h6+ Kh7 40.Kg2! a4 41.g6+! Kxh6 42.Rh1+ Kg7 ( 42...Kg5 43.Kf3 mates, since the coming Rh5 is unstoppable ) 43.Rh7+ Kf8 44.Nh5 c2 45.Nf6 c1=Q 46.Rf7# is mate! An autopsy is performed on the black king's corpse and arrives at the following conclusion - He is still dead.

**24...b3!**

Black may be threatening to promote a new queen in the middlegame!

**25.Re1?**

This overreaction does little to mitigate White's embarrassment, since it loses the initiative and admits his last move was incorrect. An idle threat is an ineffective strategy. If you point a gun at an armed intruder who entered your home, don't just point; pull the trigger.

White had to try 25.Bxf7! which may just barely hold the draw in the line 25...Qe7 26.cxb3 Qxf7 27.Qxf7+ Nxf7 28.bxc4 dxc4 29.Rg3 a5 30.Kc2 Rb8 31.Nf4 a4 ( 31...Nd8 32.Rg7+ Kc6 33.g4 Rb7 34.Rg6 a4 35.d5+ Kc5 36.Rg8 Rf7 37.Rxd8 Rxf4 38.d6! Bb7 39.d7 Be4+ 40.Kd2 Kc6 41.Ke3 Rxg4 42.f3 Bxf3 43.Kxf3 Rxh4 44.Ra8 Kxd7 45.Rxa4 Rh3+ 46.Ke4 Rxc3 47.Ra7+ Ke8 48.Ra8+ Kd7 49.Ra7+ Kc6 50.Ra6+ Kb5 51.Rxe6 Rh3 52.Re8 should be drawn, despite Black's extra pawn ) 32.Rg7 Ke8 33.Rg8+ Ke7 34.Ng6+ Kd7 35.Rg7 Ke8 36.Rg8+ and a draw is reached.

**25...Rb8 26.Nf4**

26.Bxf7? is met with 26...Qe7 , winning a piece.

**26...Qa2?**

Having written a book on Korchnoi (his games are nightmarishly difficult to annotate), the most striking aspect to his games is they produce a huge number of exclamation marks and even more question marks, since he tends to push complications past the point of tolerable human computation limits.

Black should play 26...b2 27.Rb1 Kc7! 28.Qxh6! Rb6! and there is no defence to the coming ...Qa2, ( the premature 28...Qa2?? is met with the cheapo 29.Nxd5+! Kc6 30.Rxb2! Qxb2 31.Qf6! when it is Black who is in deep trouble. )

**27.Bxf7??**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Time pressure is that place where our plots and schemes come to full maturation and are put on display. After White's last move, unwanted and unforeseen circumstances arise before White. The evaluation swings from 0.00 to -15.68! Black to play and force the win.

Instead, White should have played 27.Ke2! Qxc2+ 28.Kf1 b2 29.Bxf7 b1=Q 30.Bg6+ Kc6 31.Bxc2 Qxc2 32.Qf8! Rb2 33.Ne2 Kd7 34.Qg7+ with a draw.

**27...Qxc2+**

ANSWER: Double attack. --- The queen entwines her fingers within the king's, whispering to him, "Now you are mine! You foolishly underestimated my reach and there is no place safe in the world for you to hide."

**28.Ke3 Qe4+**

White drops two pieces after 28...Qe4+ 29.Kd2 Qxf4+ 30.Ke2 Qxf7 . --- SUMMARY: This is an example of a black king run to the queenside. I wouldn't repeat Korchnoi's 15...Qa5?! (Yes. If we play it, the move automatically gets downgraded to "dubious"). Better to replace the move with 15...Bd7, the saner choice!

0-1

### (65)Grund, H.   --   Kobalia, M. 45: European U18 Ch, Rimavska Sobota  1996   0-1   C12 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.e5 h6 6.Bd2 Bxc3 7.Bxc3**

QUESTION: Why isn't this move the main line? It looks logical to avoid weakening the structure by capturing with the b-pawn. --- ANSWER: The trouble is White must waste time to avoid weakening the queenside pawns, thus losing all hope of an opening edge.

**7...Ne4 8.Bb4**

White's idea behind the variation: 1. He preserves his powerful dark-squared bishop, without sac'ing a pawn, as seen in the 6 Be3 and 6 Bc1 lines. However, some variations may appear similar and yet are very different, like the words 'principle' and 'principal'. --- 2. White avoids the queenside pawn weaknesses associated with this line. --- 3. White has the bishop pair. --- QUESTION: This sounds wonderful for White's side. Is there a downside for him? --- ANSWER: Please see Black's next move!

The young Fischer once came up with the theoretical novelty 8.Ba5?! but it was a bad one! White loses even more time with this move: ( 8...O-O 9.Bd3 Nc6! 10.Bc3 and this is an admission that the idea failed, ( even worse for White is 10.Bxe4?! dxe4 11.Bc3 Qg5 12.g3 Rd8 and Black has the initiative and the potential for further light square domination by Black ) 10...Nxc3 . Following 11.bxc3 f6 12.f4 fxe5 13.fxe5 Ne7 14.Nf3 c5 15.O-O Qa5 , White has no compensation to speak of for his inferior structure, R.Fischer-T.Petrosian, Curacao 1962. ) ( . Also good for Black is 8...b6 and if 9.Bb4? , Black has 9...c5 10.Ba3 Qh4 when 11.g3 is met with the shot 11...Nxg3! 12.fxg3 Qe4+ 13.Kf2 Qxh1 14.Nf3 O-O 15.Rc1 f6 16.Qd2 fxe5 17.Bg2 Qxh2 18.Rh1 Qxh1 19.Bxh1 e4 20.dxc5 Rf7 21.Qe3 Nd7 22.Kg1 exf3 23.Bxf3 Nxc5 24.Bh5 Rf8 25.Bxc5 bxc5 26.Qxc5 Rb8 27.b3 Rb7 . Advantage to Black, who has two rooks and a pawn for the queen. )

**8...c5!**

This move equalizes.

**9.Bxc5**

QUESTION: I don't get it. Why did White voluntarily hand back the powerful dark-squared bishop when he could have played 9.dxc5 ? --- ANSWER: White's last move is a huge blunder. Let's make an exercise of it to discover why. --- EXERCISE (combination alert): White's last move qualifies as a "??". How does Black exploit it? --- ANSWER: Double attack. 9...Nxf2! 10.Kxf2 Qh4+ Oops. Black regains the piece with a winning position after 11.g3 Qxb4 when Black wins material and remains with the superior position.

**9...Nxc5 10.dxc5 Qa5+**

Alternatively, after 10...Nd7 11.Qd4 Qc7 12.Nf3 Nxc5 13.Bd3 Bd7 14.O-O Rc8 15.Rfe1 Qb6 16.Rac1 Bb5 17.Bxb5+ Qxb5 18.c4 dxc4 , R.Spielmann-A.Nimzowitsch, Gothenburg 1920, Black stands at least equal after 19.Rxc4 O-O 20.Rec1 b6 21.b4 Rcd8 22.Qc3 Nd3 23.Ra1 Rd5 .

**11.Qd2 Qxc5 12.Nf3 Nc6 13.Bd3 Bd7**

QUESTION: Doesn't White stand better with: 1. Extra space. --- 2. Potential control over the d4-square. --- 3. The better bishop. --- 4. Attacking chances? --- ANSWER: I prefer Black, but the objective evaluation is probably equal. Let's tackle your arguments point by point: 1. White's extra space may disappear when Black tosses in a timely ...f6. --- 2. White may at some stage lose control over the d4-square if Black plays ...f6, exchanges pawns and achieves ...e5. --- 3. As we have seen throughout the book, Black's 'bad bishop' is an overstated argument (I sense that you are deliberately provoking me into yet another one of my 'the-bad-bishop-is-in reality-a-good-piece' rants!). --- 4. Black has access to potential queenside play via the open c-file and the possibility of ...b5 expansion ideas later. --- 5. What attacking chances!?

**14.O-O b5**

A new move. Ah ha! Argument number 4 appears!

**15.Rfe1 Rb8 16.Qf4 O-O**

As long as Black has access to ...f6 or ...f5, he shouldn't fear a kingside attack.

**17.Rad1 b4 18.Rd2 a5 19.Bf1**

QUESTION: What? Why didn't White go for mate with 19.Re3 ? --- ANSWER: Let's see how Black should meet this plan: 19...Qe7 20.h4 Kh8 21.h5 a4 22.Nh2 f6 Principle: Counter in the centre when assaulted on the wing. ( Black can also play 22...Qg5 23.Qxg5 hxg5 24.Nf3 f6 with equality ) 23.exf6 Rxf6 24.Qg3 e5 and Houdini says it's equal but I prefer Black due to the central control.

**19...Rfc8!?**

Black continues to build on the queenside but this move removes the ...f6 counterattacking options.

**20.Qe3!?**

The bored queen seeks diversion from her humdrum everyday life. This move, perhaps based on the philosophy "the best victory is a bloodless one!?", is a little like a tennis pro training on a clay court when the championship is to be played on a grass court. White's mind in this game seems accustomed to overcaution. Inexplicably, White, in a kind of anti-frenzy, displays distinct signs of a cooling trend by agreeing to swap queens. --- QUESTION: What would you suggest for White?

ANSWER: A pure pawn-storm strategy is how I would play White here. For example, with 20.h4 Rc7 21.g4!? , White fires a warning shot across Black's bow and 21...Na7 22.h5 Bb5 23.g5 hxg5 24.Qxg5 Qf8 25.Kh2 Bxf1 26.Rxf1 Nc6 27.Rg1 Ne7 28.Nd4 Nc6 29.Nf3 Ne7 leads to a draw by repetition.

**20...Qe7!?**

Black's queen, like all actresses, lives for an encore. In light of new developments, Black decides to reconsider his previous intent. But what I'm desperately attempting to understand is - what new developments? Black responds with counter-inexplicability! I have no idea why Black seeks to retain queens here, since with them off, his last headache (a possible white kingside attack) disappears. I would have swapped queens in a heartbeat.

**21.Rc1**

This stock isn't likely to pay out dividends. White seeks to break free on the queenside but I'm not so sure this is such a great plan.

**21...Rc7 22.c3?!**

This is not the path to emancipation: Principle: Don't create confrontation on your opponent's strong wing. When analysing a difficult position, the two mental states we should avoid are: laxity and overexcitement. With laxity, the mind sinks into a murky dullness of non-doing. With overexcitement, our mind jumps from this line to that one, impulsively, also without true focus. Strangely enough, White seems to be somewhat guilty of both in this game, switching between waiting (when he should have been attacking on the kingside) and taking action when he shouldn't (22 c3?! plays into Black's hands). White's last move is the cause from which negative effects begin to rise sequentially. Black gears up with a minority attack to expose the white queenside pawns to pressure.

**22...bxc3 23.Qxc3**

Black also looks slightly better after 23.Rxc3 Rcb7 24.b3 a4 .

**23...Rcb7**

Stronger was 23...Rbc8! with the idea of ...Nxe5! when 24.Rcd1 Nb4 25.Qb3 a4 26.Qa3 Qc5 27.Nd4 Qb6 has Black exerting queenside pressure.

**24.b3**

I would have avoided this move also since it sets up Black up for an ...a4 minority attack, giving White a queenside isolani.

**24...Qb4 25.Bd3 a4**

This move effectively punctures White's defensive membrane.

**26.Qxb4 Rxb4 27.bxa4 Rxa4 28.h3 Kf8 29.Be2 Ke7 30.Bd1 Re4**

Black exerts strong pressure after 30...Rc4! 31.Ra1 ( 31.Rxc4 dxc4 32.Ba4 Rc8 gives Black the advantage ) 31...Na5 .

**31.Bc2 Rc4 32.Rdd1?**

EXERCISE (combination alert): How did Black siphon off a pawn while White wasn't looking?

White puts up better resistance with 32.Re1 Rb2 33.Bb3 Rxd2 34.Nxd2 Rc5 35.Nf3 f6 .

**32...Rc8!**

ANSWER: Pin.

**33.Nd2**

This does little to soften the coming blow. However, even the alternative is no bed of roses.

After 33.Bb3 Rxc1 34.Rxc1 Nxe5 35.Ra1 , White's rook and knight discover that it is no simple trick to be in two places at once as 35...Nxf3+ 36.gxf3 Bb5 37.a4 Ba6 is hopeless for White.

**33...Rc3 34.Bb3**

The aimless bishop continues to float amiably through life.

Yet, after 34.Nb1 Rc5 35.Bb3 Rxc1 36.Rxc1 Nxe5 , White still loses a key pawn in any case.

**34...Rxc1 35.Rxc1 Nxe5**

Possession of the e5-pawn finally ends the dispute in Black's favour.

**36.Re1 Kd6**

Black remains ahead a key central pawn with the superior position.

**37.f3 Nd3 38.Rd1 Rc1**

The simplest.

**39.Rxc1 Nxc1 40.Kf2 e5**

Black begins the process of rolling his centre.

**41.Ke3 f5 42.f4?**

Allowing Black two central passers. White can now safely resign.

**42...d4+ 43.Kf2 e4**

Threat: ...e3+.

**44.Bc4**

Hey, I said "Threat..." Never mind. It was hopeless no matter what White played.

**44...e3+ 45.Ke1**

EXERCISE (combination alert): White's king rests lightly, the way a wild animal is ready to awaken upon hearing even the slightest noise in the forest. Before us lies evidence of White's tragedy. Find one accurate move and Black easily consolidates. --- ANSWER: Double attack/zwischenzug.

**45...Kc5!**

If instead 45...exd2+? , Black's knight is trapped and this gives White unnecessary drawing chances after 46.Kxd2 Kc5 47.Bg8 Nxa2 48.Bxa2 .

After the text move, 45...Kc5! 46.Kd1 ( 46.Bg8 Nd3+ wins a piece ) 46...Ba4+! 47.Bb3 is met with the shot 47...Nxa2! and Black wins easily. --- SUMMARY: 7 Bxc3, while well meaning, is too clunky and slow for White to produce anything.

0-1

### (66)7: McCutcheon: 6 Be3 and 6 Bc1   --   ? ? ????   \* (Cyrus Lakdawala)

In the old days, 6 Bd2 was pretty much considered obligatory. In the last few years though, top players, perhaps unhappy with the level of White's opening advantage in the 6 Bd2 main line McCutcheon, have turned to two radical new lines, both crafted to preserve White's dark-squared bishop, the E=MC squared of the attack. Within the external randomness, there is order. We must look for it, the way a forensic blood-spatter analyst visualizes a story - by examining the blood. In both cases, White's dark-squared bishops deliver fist-pounding fire and brimstone sermons to our nervous king. It is my hope the chapter will show that we have ample structural and counterattacking resources. Yet, we must be careful as White's attacking potential is one of many tentacles. After such a heavy outlay of material and structure, there is no turning back for either side! 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.e5 h6

. Our starting positions:

The ambitious 6.Be3!? , aiming to sacrifice a pawn to keep the dark-squared bishop actively placed, and the even more radical undeveloping 6 Bc1!?. --- Soon, the positions may look something like this: 6...Ne4 7.Qg4 g6 8.a3 Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 Nxc3

and this: 6.Bc1 Ne4 7.Qg4 g6 8.Ne2 Nxc3 9.bxc3 Ba5 . --- In the 6 Be3 versions, we, as Black, have the option to grab a pawn and hunker down for the dark-squared storm to come. In the 6 Bc1 versions, material tends to be even, with both sides contorting. --- These two lines are no longer rarely-played sidelines. I'm noticing more and more in my online games their rising popularity. I predict they will both become commonplace lines, even at the non-master club levels.

This is a more modern interpretation of the McCutcheon.

QUESTION: What is the point of avoiding the pin-breaking 6.Bd2 ? --- ANSWER: White harbours a simple intent. He is willing to sac a pawn for the privilege of retaining his dark-squared bishop, which Black happily chops off the board in the 6 Bd2 versions (Chapter 6).

Later in the chapter, we will look at the even more radical try 6.Bc1!? .

**6...Ne4**

With a nasty threat on the c3-knight.

**7.Qg4**

And White ignores the threat! Once again, we are offered the choice of the weakening but more flexible ...g6 plan, or the dogged, non-weakening ...Kf8 venture.

Covering the c3-knight with 7.Ne2 without first tossing in Qg4 is too passive to offer White anything. Following 7...c5 8.dxc5 Nd7 9.f4 O-O 10.a3 Bxc3+ 11.Nxc3 Nxc3 12.bxc3 Qc7 13.Qd4 b6! 14.cxb6 axb6 , Black plans ...Ba6 with numerous structural benefits which probably outweigh White's rather useless extra pawn, D.Rensch-D.Kuljasevic, Lubbock 2010. 15.c4 is met with 15...Bb7 16.cxd5 Bxd5 with loads of compensation for the pawn.

**7...g6**

We will look at 7...Kf8 later in the chapter.

QUESTION: What happens if we give up the g7-pawn to take the bait on c3? --- ANSWER: Defence of the g7-pawn is obligatory. --- The wrong course of action 7...Nxc3? is met with 8.Qxg7 : ( 8...Ne4+?? 9.c3 Bxc3+ 10.bxc3 Ke7 11.f3 Ng5 ( 11...Nxc3?? 12.Rc1 Na4 13.Qf6+ Kd7 14.Qxf7+ Qe7 15.Rxc7+! is simply crushing ) 12.h4 Nh7 , B.Valuet-A.Chaillot, Issy les Moulineaux 2001. Black's position is in shambles after 13.Bxh6 . ) ( . Black is still in deep trouble even after the correct 8...Rf8 9.Bd2 Nxa2 10.c3 Nxc3 11.bxc3 Be7 12.Bxh6 c5 13.Nf3 . Now White can eventually pick off an exchange with a future Qh7, or simply push the passed h-pawn down the board. )

**8.a3**

The main line and really the crux of White's idea. White is willing to gambit a pawn for the privilege of retaining his dark-squared monster on e3, while at the same time removing Black's bishop, the crucial defender of the dark squares.

The other continuations are less critical: 8.Bd3 works out well for Black after 8...Nxc3 9.a3 Ba5 10.Bd2 Na4! 11.Bxa5 Nxb2 12.Bb5+ Bd7 13.Be2 Nc6 14.Bc3 Na4 15.Bd2 Qe7 16.Nf3 O-O-O 17.O-O g5 and I don't believe in White's compensation for the pawn, M.Huerga Leache-J.Granda Zuniga, Pamplona 2009.

8.Ne2 c5 : ( 9.a3 Qa5 10.Rd1 Bxc3+ 11.Nxc3 Nc6 12.dxc5 Nxc3 13.bxc3 Qxc3+ 14.Rd2 , G.Tringov-R.Fuchs, Kienbaum Berlin 1958. At this point Houdini likes Black after 14...Qxa3! 15.Be2 Qa1+ 16.Bd1 Qxe5 17.O-O a5 and Black intends to push the a-pawn down the board as far as possible to tie down White, who doesn't come close to getting compensation for the two missing pawns. ) ( 9.O-O-O!? Nxc3 10.Nxc3 Bxc3 11.bxc3 c4! 12.h4 Nd7! 13.Bd2 ( 13.h5 g5 14.f4 is met with 14...f5! with a clear advantage to Black, who can close the kingside after 15.Qg3 g4 ) 13...Qe7 14.Kb1 b5 15.Be2 h5 16.Qg5 , V.Kireev-Y.Ilyushchenko, correspondence 2009. Black looks better after 16...Qa3! . After 17.Rh3 Rb8 18.Rf3 Rb6 19.Bc1 Qa4 , Black's chances look superior. )

**8...Bxc3+**

Black should accept the challenge and take the pawn, despite the grievous risk of future dark-square annihilation. --- QUESTION: Why should we cooperate when we can back up to a5, thereby retaining our dark-squared bishop?

ANSWER: This tempting prospect works out well for White after 8...Ba5?! 9.Ne2 : ( 9...c5 10.dxc5 Nc6 11.b4 Nxe5 12.Qh3 Bc7? ( Black should go for 12...Nxc3 13.Nxc3 Bc7 14.Nb5 Bb8 15.Nd6+! Bxd6 16.cxd6 Qxd6 17.Bd4 f6 18.Qh4 Kf7 19.f4 Nd7 20.Bd3 when White's bishop pair, developmental lead and attacking chances outweigh Black's extra pawn ) 13.Nxe4 dxe4 14.Rd1 Bd7 15.Nc3 f5 16.Nb5 Nf7 17.Bc4! (threat: Bxe6) 17...Qc8 , I.Smikovski-R.Bagirov, Serpukhov 2008. Black is strategically lost. Houdini's analysis continues 18.Nxc7+ Qxc7 19.O-O O-O-O 20.Bd4 Ne5 ( Black gets totally tangled up after 20...Rhg8 21.Bf6 Rde8 22.Qb3 Rgf8 23.a4 ) 21.Be2 Ba4 22.Qc3 Rd5 23.Bc4 Re8 24.Bxd5 exd5 and Black has insufficient compensation for the exchange. ) ( 9...Nxc3 10.Nxc3 c5 11.dxc5 Bxc3+ 12.bxc3 also looks better for White since he controls more space, leads in development, dominates the dark squares and is up a pawn (albeit a tripled one!) 12...Qa5 , Z.Mammadov-R.Bagirov, Baku 2010. Play might continue 13.Qd4! Nc6 14.Qd2 b6 15.cxb6 axb6 16.Bd3 Nxe5 17.Bd4 f6 18.O-O Kf7 19.Rfb1 with dangerous attacking chances for White. )

**9.bxc3 c5**

In the next game, we will look at 9...Nxc3 .

**10.Bd3 h5!?**

I suggest we take a detour from the main line and try this rarely played, forcing byway, since it will probably throw most of your opponents off theoretically. --- QUESTION: What is the normal course of events here?

ANSWER: Black normally plays 10...Nxc3 . I'm not crazy about Black's position after 11.dxc5 Nc6 12.Nf3 , Z.Hracek-A.Vaisser, Pula 1997. Houdini gives White a slight plus. I feel that White's space, open b-file, bishop pair and dark-square control are worth more than Black's better pawn structure.

**11.Qf3**

11.Qf4 is met with 11...g5 12.Qf3 Nxc3 13.dxc5 Nc6 14.Qg3 Qa5 15.Bd2 Qxc5 16.Nf3 , E.Berg-H.Tikkanen, Malmo 2012. ( 16.Qxg5? is met favourably with 16...Ne4! 17.Bxe4 Qd4! 18.Rb1 Qxe4+ 19.Kd1 Qxe5 with the advantage to Black ) 16...g4 . Chances look dynamically balanced after 17.Ng5 Qd4 18.Qf4 Qxf4 19.Bxf4 d4 20.h3 Rg8 21.Ne4 Nd5 .

**11...Nxc3 12.dxc5 Nc6**

The point of Black's 10...h5 is displayed. He gains a tempo by hitting the e5-pawn.

**13.Qf4**

13.Bd2!? Na4 ( less safe is 13...Nxe5!? 14.Qf4 Nxd3+ 15.cxd3 d4 16.Nf3 O-O and I think Black is okay here, despite White's ominous build-up of kingside attacking forces ) 14.Qf4 Nxc5 15.Nf3 b6! 16.O-O Ba6 17.Bxa6 Nxa6 18.Qa4 Qc8 19.Bg5 Nc5 20.Qf4 Qd7 21.Bf6 Rg8 22.c4 , Goh Wei Ming-D.Erashchenkov, Internet (blitz) 2005. Black can try 22...d4 23.Rfd1 d3 24.Ra2 Na5 25.Ne1 Rc8 26.Rad2 g5! 27.Bxg5 Nxc4 28.Qxc4 Rxg5 and after 29.Nxd3 Nxd3 30.Rxd3 Rxc4 31.Rxd7 Rxe5 32.Rxa7 Re2 , Black has the slightly better chances although the game should probably end in a draw.

**13...d4**

Gaining a tempo and clearing d5 for his pieces.

**14.Bd2 g5!**

Forcing the trade of queens as well as exchanging a flank pawn for a central one.

**15.Qxg5**

15.Qg3 is met with 15...Qd5! 16.Qxg5 Qxe5+ 17.Qxe5 Nxe5 which would transpose to the game continuation after 18.Bg5 ( although White can deviate with 18.Bxc3 dxc3 19.Ne2 Rg8 20.O-O Nxd3 21.cxd3 Bd7 22.Nxc3 Bc6 23.f3 Rd8 24.Rad1 Rd4 25.Kf2 Rg5 26.Ne2 Ra4 27.d4 Rxa3 28.Ra1 Rxa1 29.Rxa1 a6 30.Nc3 when the game looks equal. )

**15...Qxg5 16.Bxg5 Nxe5**

The position may be dynamically balanced, since Black managed to wipe out White's centre and his knights are powerfully centralized.

**17.Nf3?!**

War is the great un-builder of things. White opts for perilous speed over slow-moving safety. A high-risk move like this may be satisfying to play, but it also weakens and therefore invites structural retaliation in the future. The script has yet to be acted out and White demands a radical rewrite. As chess players, we all learn to deal with a crisis. But I ask - why manufacture one for yourself? One can defeat or evade an external enemy. When the enemy is internal - for example, a desire for the initiative at any cost - there is no way to evade the crisis. GM Alex Baburin disapproved of this move, calling it "pseudo-active". It may be a sign of overextension/frustration on White's part.

Rather than this prickly response, White should play the calm 17.Bf6 as optimism should be conjoined with rationality. Following 17...Nxd3+ 18.cxd3 Rg8 19.Bxd4 Nd5 20.g3 f6 21.f4 Bd7 , White's position is better than what he achieved in the stem game.

**17...Rg8!**

Black declines the opportunity of saddling White with double f-pawns.

QUESTION: Why wouldn't Black choose to decimate White's pawn structure after 17...Nxf3+ 18.gxf3 Nd5 ? --- ANSWER: That would have given White a developmental lead and the bishop pair. The comp assesses in White's favour after 19.Be4! Rg8 20.Bh4 Bd7 21.Bxd5 exd5 22.Kd2 when Black is behind in development and the presence of the opposite-coloured bishops is clearly in White's favour here.

**18.Bf6 Nxd3+ 19.cxd3 Nd5 20.Bxd4 Rxg2**

Advantage Black: 1. The opposite-coloured bishops favour Black, since his domination of the light squares outweighs White's strength on the dark squares. --- 2. Black's knight is powerfully posted on d5. --- 3. Black's active rook is an annoying presence for White as well. --- 4. White owns more pawn islands than Black and therefore has the slightly weaker pawn structure.

**21.Be5**

Threatening Bg3 and Kf1, entombing and winning Black's rook.

**21...Rg4 22.h3 Ra4!**

The annoying rook ties White down to defence of the a3-pawn.

**23.Rg1 f6 24.Bb2 Kf7**

Cutting off the white rook's entry to the kingside.

**25.d4!**

QUESTION: Didn't White's last move take further liberties with his structure by leaving gaping holes on the central light squares? --- ANSWER: If puppets were sentient, I strongly suspect they would resent their strings. It's true that White, with his last move, dances to Black's tune, yet sometimes it becomes necessary to take on a minor evil to fend off an even worse fate.

Sutovsky probably feared the coming ...e5. For example, after 25.Kd2 Rf4! 26.Ke2 e5 (uncovering an attack on the h3-pawn) 27.Bc1 Ra4 28.Rh1 Bf5 , the threat of ...Rd8 to gang up on the weak d3-pawn is in the air and White is busted.

**25...b6?!**

I don't like this move and would use the term "pseudo-active" if Baburin hadn't beaten me to it! It is in Black's self-interest to retain as many pawns as possible on the board.

I would go for 25...Bd7 26.Nd2 . Wang Hao may have feared a line like 26...Nf4 27.Ne4 !? Nd3+ 28.Ke2 Nxb2 29.Nd6+ Kf8 30.Rg3 Rb8 31.Rag1 Ke7 32.Rb3 Nc4 33.Rg7+ Kd8 34.Nxb7+ Kc7 35.c6! Kxc6 36.Rxd7! Rxa3 37.Rxa3 Nxa3 38.Nc5 Rb2+ 39.Kd3 Rb3+! 40.Nxb3 Kxd7 41.h4 and despite White's fancy footwork, Black retains excellent winning chances with a clean extra pawn.

**26.cxb6 Nxb6**

Black can also try 26...Ba6!? 27.bxa7? Nf4 28.Bc1 Nd3+ 29.Kd2 Rxa7 and White remains in deep trouble, since 30.Ke3? is met with 30...Rb7 31.Nd2 Nb4! with a winning position.

**27.Nd2 Rb8 28.Rg3**

Challenging Black on the b-file.

**28...Nd5 29.Rb3 Rxb3 30.Nxb3 Ra6 31.Nc5 Rb6 32.Bc1 h4!**

Black fixes the h3-pawn as a target. Now White must be on a constant look out for ...e5.

**33.Bd2?!**

A veteran soldier may still feel twinges of pain from an old, seemingly long healed, wound. In such hair-trigger positions, the consequences of even a tiny inaccuracy can be irreversible. After this move, White's defensive goals recede into oblivion.

Houdini gives 33.f3! and Black should probably hold off on 33...e5 since White gets good drawing chances by eliminating pawns from the board with 34.dxe5 fxe5 35.Bg5 Nf4 36.Bxf4 exf4 37.Nd3 Rb3 38.Nxf4 Rxf3 39.Rc1 Bf5 40.Ng2 Rxh3 41.Rc7+ Kf6 42.Rxa7 Be4 43.Nxh4 Rxh4 . To a computer, rook plus bishop versus rook is drawn. In human versus human encounters, the extra bishop side probably wins over 50% of the time.

**33...e5**

This thematic break dooms the h3-pawn. Bishops are most feral when allowed to roam the open spaces as their hunting ground.

**34.dxe5 Bxh3 35.Nd3**

EXERCISE (planning): White's previous recklessness and his present woes display a clear degree of convergence. Come up with a clear winning plan for Black. --- ANSWER: Prepare to promote the passed h-pawn, when h1 will be the burial ground, where all of White's sorrows come to die.

**35...Bg2!**

Now White faces episcopal wrath on the long white diagonal.

**36.Nf4 h3! 37.Nxd5**

White is nevertheless in trouble anyway after 37.Nxg2 hxg2 38.Ke2 fxe5 39.Kf3 Rg6 40.Rg1 Ke6 and the trouble is 41.Rxg2?? hangs a rook to 41...e4+ .

**37...h2!**

Zwischenzug - threatening to promote with check.

**38.Ke2 Bxd5 39.f3 Rb3**

Target: f3. "Bygones are never bygones," Black's rook tells White's king.

**40.Be3**

EXERCISE (combination alert): It's as if White just barely survived a heart attack, only to be informed by his doctor that he now must battle cancer. How did Black commence a breakthrough? --- ANSWER: Deflection. There is no defence to the coming ...f4.

**40...f5! 41.Rh1**

41.Rf1 walks into 41...Bc4+ .

**41...f4**

. SUMMARY: Let's go with the rare line 10...h5!? with the idea of gaining more tempi with a future ...g5.

0-1

### (68)Gashimov, V.   --   Nakamura, H. 47: Amber (rapid), Monte Carlo  2011   0-1   C12 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.e5 h6 6.Be3 Ne4 7.Qg4 g6 8.a3 Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 Nxc3**

The larcenous butler just can't seem to keep his hands off the silverware. Nakamura grabs the pawn and intends to hang on to it for dear life.

**10.Bd3 b6!?**

Nakamura tries a rarely played idea, eschewing ...c5 pawn-returning lines. Instead, he intends ...Ba6, eliminating White's nasty attacker on d3. --- QUESTION: Doesn't Black's avoidance of ...c5 violate the principle: Counter in the centre when attacked on the wing, since Black's kingside looks pretty shaky? --- ANSWER: It does violate the principle, yet the move also follows the principle: Don't open the game when behind in development. So in this instance, we have a case of conflicting principles and we can only go with our intuition.

**11.h4**

The late GM Vugar Gashimov, whose life ended just a week prior to the time of this writing at the tender age of 27, was robbed of a glorious destiny in the chess world by his too-early passing. He was a ferocious attacker, never afraid to sac. Here he planned h5, followed by f4, prying open Black's kingside.

**11...Ba6 12.h5**

QUESTION: Can White try a bishop sac on g6? Black can't respond with ...Rg8, since the e6-pawn hangs, right?

ANSWER: Let's see: 12.Bxg6 fxg6 ( as you mentioned, 12...Rg8?? would lose miserably to 13.Qxe6+ ) 13.Qxe6+ Qe7 14.Qxg6+ Kd7 15.Bxh6 is tempting but costs White time after 15...Nc6 16.Bg5 Qe8 17.Qf5+ Qe6 18.Qxe6+ Kxe6 19.Nf3 Ne4 20.Be3 Rag8 21.Rg1 Rg4 . White's four (!) passed pawns are all firmly blockaded and Black's piece is worth far more. Houdini rates it at a whopping -2.35, a winning position for Black. So the answer to your question may be - the sac may give White some practical chances, but under the more judicial gaze of the comps, may be ultimately unsound.

**12...g5 13.f4!**

Crashing through on the kingside yet Black continues to have access to defensive resources.

**13...gxf4 14.Bxf4**

QUESTION: Doesn't White have a crushing zwischenzug with 14.Qg7 ? --- ANSWER: It actually looks promising but I wouldn't label it "crushing". Houdini's analysis runs 14...Kd7 15.Qxf7+ Qe7 16.Qxe7+ Kxe7 17.Bxf4 Bxd3 18.cxd3 Nd7 19.Nf3 c5 20.Kd2 Na4 21.Nh4 Rh7 22.Ng6+ Kd8 23.g4 cxd4 24.g5 ( 24.Bxh6? is unsound as Black defends after 24...Rxh6 25.g5 Rh7 26.Nf4 Ke7 27.h6 Nxe5 28.g6 Nxg6 29.Nxg6+ Kd6 . Black should be able to win this due to his extra central pawns, since White's passed h-pawn has been stymied ) 24...Nac5 threatening a fork on b3. 25.Ke2 hxg5 26.Bxg5+ Kc7 27.Rag1 b5 28.Bf6 Nxf6 29.exf6 Kd6 30.Rf1 Nd7 31.f7 Nf8 and White's passers have been blockaded (just barely!). Houdini rates the position at dead even.

**14...Kd7!?**

The alternative is 14...Qe7 to meet 15.Qg7?! with 15...Qf8 16.Qxf8+ Kxf8 when I don't think White gets full compensation for his missing pawn.

**15.Bd2 Ne4!**

Brilliantly evaluated. Nakamura correctly sees that Black gets ample compensation for returning the pawn in the form of light square power and the removal of White's bishop pair.

**16.Bxe4 dxe4 17.Qxe4 Kc8**

EXERCISE (calculation): Black's last move may be ingenious handiwork by Nakamura, but that doesn't automatically mean the idea is sound. Let's suspend our disbelief at the move's apparent unsoundness and work out the facts. Can White get away with grabbing the a8-rook? --- ANSWER: Concealment of one's plan is a kind of information, useful to the opponent, but only if the opponent correctly guesses your plan. If a player rated close to Elo 2800 offers you a 'free' rook, I advise you to view the offer with deep suspicion. The rook is immune and the idea, backed up by the comps, is absolutely sound. Nakamura's last move deserves an exclam. He makes use of some nifty mental acrobatics to remain afloat.

**18.Nf3!**

White's frustrated queen blushes violently about the misunderstanding with Black's hanging rook. She tends to get petulant when her whims are thwarted by what she considers blind luck.

With 18.Qxa8?? , the queen's eyebrows converge to form a deeply offended frown. So she hands out what she believes to be punishment for the impudence of the a8-rook. There is no feeling more nightmarish than purchasing a product at a shopping mall for $100 and then upon returning home, turn on our TV to find see the same product advertised on sale for $50. This is sort of what happens here. Initially, the comps think White is winning after the queen takes the hanging a8-rook. But give them a few seconds and they all declare in unison that White is busted. Following 18...Bb7 19.Qxa7 Qxd4 20.Rb1 ( 20.Rd1 Qe4+ 21.Ne2 Nc6 traps White's queen ) 20...Rd8 21.Bxh6 Qc3+ 22.Kf1 Qc4+! (a key point to Black's combination, seizing control of a4, the white queen's crucial flight square) 23.Ne2 Nc6 ,White's queen is indeed trapped.

**18...Bb7 19.Qf4 Rh7**

Houdini doesn't want to allow White c4 and prefers 19...Bd5!? 20.Qxf7 Rf8 21.Qg6 Bxf3 22.gxf3 Qxd4 23.Ke2 Nc6 24.Bxh6 Qc4+ 25.Qd3 Nd4+ 26.Kd1 Qxd3+ 27.cxd3 Rxf3 28.Kd2! when the b3-fork is an illusion since White's king can attack Black's f3-rook. After 28...Kb7 29.Rag1 Rh8 30.Rg6 ( definitely not 30.Bg7? Rd8 31.h6? Nb5 32.h7 Rdxd3+ 33.Kc1 Rc3+ 34.Kb1 Rb3+ 35.Kc1 Rfc3+ 36.Kd1 Rb1+ 37.Kd2 Rb2+ 38.Kd1 Rxa3 39.Kc1 Re2 40.Kb1 Nc3+ 41.Kc1 Ra1# mate! ) 30...Rf5 and I think White is the only one in danger of losing.

**20.O-O-O!?**

20.c4! (intending to place White's king on f2) may give him a strategic edge since Black's light-square blockade vanishes.

**20...Qd5**

Taking control over c4 and the central light squares.

**21.Qg4!**

Threat: Qg8.

**21...Kd7?!**

QUESTION: What would you play here?

The infiltration 21...Qa2! looks like a more accurate move order. However, when we find ourselves in an irrational position, the power of logic tends to be an overrated commodity. Black's last move was inaccurate and allowed White a combination.

**22.Qg8?!**

Now we merely transpose to the above note.

ANSWER: Nakamura was fortunate that Gashimov missed 22.Bxh6! , the point being 22...Rxh6? is met with 23.Qg7 trapping Black's rook and winning material.

**22...Qa2!**

With a sneaky mating threat on a1.

**23.Bc3 Be4!**

And now one on c2.

**24.Bb2 Qc4**

Okay, now the queen gets downright annoying. Yet another vulgar one-move mate threat!

**25.Rd2 Na6**

The g8-invader is repelled.

**26.Qg4 Bd5 27.Rd3!**

Clearing the way for Nd2!.

**27...Qc6 28.Nd2 Rf8 29.Rc3 Qb7 30.Re3!?**

White intends Ne4 to persuade Black to trade off his best-placed piece (the d5-Bishop).

**30...b5**

Halting c4.

White looks better if Black grabs g2 with 30...Bxg2 31.Rg1 Bc6 32.Reg3 Kc8 33.Qf4 and White intends Rg7.

**31.Ne4 Bxe4**

No choice. Black's bishop was a powerful piece but White's knight was even stronger.

**32.Rxe4 c6**

Houdini doesn't approve of this natural move, which intends to swing the wayward knight to d5, via c7.

**33.Bc3 Qc8**

Intending ...Rg8.

**34.Rf1 Rg8 35.Qh3 Nc7 36.Ref4 Rgg7**

Harry Houdini would have approved of Naka's contortions.

**37.Bb4 Nd5 38.R4f2 Qg8 39.Bc5**

We find no clear cut winner or loser from the tussle and the position remains balanced with Black's powerful knight countered by White's good "bad" bishop and space.

**39...a5**

This move, however, looks overly optimistic and weakens the black king's cover.

**40.Qd3!?**

The queen springs into action with a shocking vivacity for a woman her age. Gashimov hands over the g2-pawn to go after Black's king.

**40...a4 ?!**

In positions of this level of complexity, and on the last move of the time control, both sides take on excessive risks.

Black should accept the gift with 40...Rxg2! 41.Rxg2 Qxg2 and the h7-rook doesn't really hang, since White's queen is needed to guard the one on f1.

**41.g4! Qd8?!**

When a soldier returns home from a war, a personality change can occur. The queen now perhaps embraces a more pacifist philosophy.

Black should play 41...Rxg4! though Nakamura surely rejected the move due to 42.Qxh7! . Yet Black may be able to hold the ending after 42...Qxh7 43.Rxf7+ Qxf7 44.Rxf7+ Ke8 45.Rh7 when Black is the one fighting for the draw. After 45...Rg1+ 46.Kb2 Rh1 47.Rxh6 Kf7 48.Rh8 Kg7 49.Re8 Kf7 50.Rc8 Rxh5 51.Rxc6 Rh2 (with the threat of ...Ne3), Black is likely to reach a draw.

**42.c4**

The comp gives the impossible-to-find line 42.Kb1! Qg8 43.c4 bxc4 44.Qxc4 Rxg4 45.Qa6 Nc7 46.Qa7 Rg1 47.Bb6 Rxf1+ 48.Rxf1 Qc8 . --- EXERCISE (combination alert): It appears as if Black is hanging on but this isn't the reality. White to play and win. --- ANSWER: Clearance. White threatens d6 and both recaptures lose. 49.d5!! . Logical argument failed to persuade, so now the d-pawn tries the backup plan - an uppercut to the kidney. After 49...exd5 ( or 49...cxd5 50.Rc1 ) 50.Rf6! and the rook seeks to wipe the look of smug satisfaction from the black king's face. There is no defence to the coming Rd6+.

**42...Qg5+ 43.Rd2**

The stronger 43.Kb1! bxc4 44.Qxc4 intending Rb2, gives White a winning attack.

**43...bxc4 44.Qxc4 Qe3 45.Qa6?!**

White gets better winning chances after 45.Qxa4 Rxg4 46.Qa7+ Kc8 47.Qa6+ Kc7 48.Bd6+ Kd7 49.Qb7+ Kd8 50.Qxc6 Rg3 51.Bf8 Qc3+ 52.Qxc3 Rxc3+ 53.Kb2 Rh3 .

**45...Nc7 46.Qxa4 Rxg4**

The game remains balanced.

**47.Qc2**

King rook and queen all clasp hands in joyous reunion.

**47...Rg2!**

A formerly bullied person always takes solace in that most soothing of opiates: Dreams of revenge. The threat to the h7-rook can be overridden.

**48.d5?**

This over-optimistic move imperils White's chances. In a few moves, apprehension begins to slowly replace optimism.

**48...Qxd2+ 49.Qxd2 Rxd2 50.Kxd2**

Of course the zwischenzugs 50.dxe6+?? Nxe6

and 50.dxc6+ Kxc6 fail miserably for White, in each case hanging the bishop.

**50...exd5 51.Be3 Ne6 52.Rf6 Rg7 53.Bxh6**

I think only Black can win from this point.

**53...Rg2+?**

This is only equal.

White is in deep trouble after 53...Rh7! 54.a4 c5 55.a5 Kc6 .

**54.Ke1 Ke7 55.Rf2 Rg1+ 56.Rf1 Rg3 57.Rh1?**

White should probably hold the draw after 57.Bc1 Rh3 58.h6 Nc5 .

**57...Rxa3 58.Bc1 Ra1 59.Kf2 Ra2+ 60.Kg3**

EXERCISE (planning): The interchange of opposing plans worked out in Black's favour. Come up with a step-by-step winning plan for Black to convert. --- ANSWER:

**60...Kf8!**

Step 1: Black's king reaches h8 in the nick of time.

**61.h6 Kg8 62.Rf1 Ra7!**

Step 2: Prevent h7+ deflection ideas.

**63.Rd1 Rd7!**

Step 3: Cover d5 to play ...c5, activating the two central passers.

**64.Kg4 c5 65.Kf5 Kh7 66.Be3 d4 67.Bf2 c4 68.Ke4 c3**

Of course the d4-pawn isn't really hanging, due to Black's c-pawn promotion threat.

**69.Kd3 Nc5+ 70.Kc4**

White's king lashes out, upbraiding his worthless defenders.

**70...c2**

The pawns are unblockadable.

**71.Rc1 d3!**

This move constitutes trespass over sacred ground. The threat of ...d2 overrides all else.

**72.Be3 Ne4**

Now ...d2 can't be prevented.

**73.Kb3**

The king's glassy eyes gaze at the ruin around him.

**73...d2 74.Bxd2 Rxd2 75.Rxc2 Rxc2 76.Kxc2 Kxh6**

. SUMMARY: I suspect Nakamura's plan of 9...Nxc3 and 10...b6!? may be as sound as Black's standard ...c5 plan, which we looked at in the first game of this chapter. It looks interesting and may throw an unprepared opponent off, so it's worth a try.

0-1

### (69)Lanka, Z.   --   Morozevich, A. 48: Chebanenco Memorial, Kishinev  1998   0-1   C12 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.e5 h6 6.Be3 Ne4 7.Qg4 Kf8**

"How can there be a counter-position in opposition to those who have no position?" wrote the monk/philosopher Nagarjuna, circa 200 CE. Black retains fluidity in his kingside pawns, which in turn keeps White guessing how the structure will finally congeal. This time we look at the non-weakening 7...Kf8 version, which feels more logical to me than the 7...g6 lines in the 6 Be3 variation. --- QUESTION: Why do you favour ...Kf8 over ...g6? --- ANSWER: In the 6 Be3 and 6 Bc1 (which we will look at later in the chapter) lines, White hangs on to his dark-squared bishop, unlike the 6 Bd2 main line which we looked at in the last chapter. This means White has far greater dark-square power. Thus, I feel it's logical to avoid weakening our dark squares with ...g6.

**8.a3**

White can also sacrifice a pawn without prompting Black: 8.Bd3 Nxc3 ( 8...Bxc3+?! 9.bxc3 Nxc3 should be avoided as White is up a tempo over the normal lines since he didn't waste a move on a3 ) 9.a3 Ba5 10.Bd2 Na4! ( I think this move is more promising for Black than 10...c5 ) 11.Bxa5 Nxb2 12.Bb4+ Kg8 13.Be2 b6! 14.h4 Ba6 15.Rh3 Bxe2 16.Nxe2 Nc4 and a beautiful outpost is established for Black's long-wandering knight. After 17.Nf4 Rh7 18.Nh5 Nd7 (halting Nf6+) 19.Bd2 ( 19.Rg3 g6 20.Qf4 Rc8 21.Nf6+ Nxf6 22.exf6 c5 23.Bc3 Qd6 and White's attack is at an end, leaving him down a pawn with a busted position ) 19...Kh8 and Black is a pawn up with his king safe. It's hard to see how White proceeds with his attack at this point, O.Koesebay-V.Turkov, correspondence 2002.

8.Ne2 c5 : ( 9.f3 Nxc3 10.bxc3 cxd4 11.Bxd4 Ba5 12.f4 Nc6 13.Bc5+ Kg8 14.Qf3 b6 15.Bd6 , B.Savchenko-S.Volkov, Dagomys 2008. I prefer Black's chances after 15...Bd7 16.O-O-O Rc8 17.Kb2 Ne7 . ) ( 9.O-O-O!? Nxc3 10.Nxc3 Bxc3 11.bxc3 Qa5 12.dxc5 Nc6 13.Kd2 Nxe5 14.Qb4 Nc6 15.Qxa5 Nxa5 16.Rb1 f6 and chances look balanced with White's developmental lead and bishop pair accounting for Black's structural advantage, "Rodo"-D.Breder, Internet (blitz) 2007. ( ) )

**8...Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 c5**

The thematic move.

In the next game, we will look at the greedier and possibly better move 9...Nxc3 .

**10.Bd3 Nxc3 11.dxc5**

White regains the lost pawn and opens up the position. Of course this comes at the high cost of a smashed pawn structure.

**11...Nc6 12.Nf3 f5!**

GM Neil McDonald thinks this move is inaccurate and gives it a "?!" mark. --- QUESTION: What does he suggest instead?

ANSWER: He suggests 12...f6 , giving the move an exclam. --- QUESTION: You don't agree? --- ANSWER: No, I would flip the evaluations and believe 12...f5! is correct, while giving 12...f6?! instead. I don't like the idea of Black retaining central tension when he is so far behind in development. For example, after 13.Nh4! Nxe5 , I don't like Black's game after 14.Qb4 d4 15.Qxd4 Nd5 16.O-O Kf7 17.Be4 Nxe3 18.Qxe3 when Black remains dangerously behind in development in an open position. If 18...f5 19.Bf3 Qc7 20.Rad1 , I don't think Black can survive the lag in development.

**13.exf6!?**

White opens the game when leading in development, but at the same time gambles as the move gives away White's central control.

It isn't clear that this is White's best though there is an argument to be made for avoiding the following moves: 13.Qh3 Ne4 , R.Freitag-T.Luther, Bad Wildbad 2000. At this point, 14.g4?! can be met with 14...d4 15.Bf4 Qd5 16.gxf5 exf5 17.Rg1 Nxc5 and if 18.Bxf5?! Ne7 19.Bxc8 Rxc8 . White looks overextended, is down a pawn and his king in greater danger than Black's.

13.Qh5! is given an "!" by McDonald and I agree that it is White's most promising continuation. Black must play very carefully to survive the coming assault. --- QUESTION: What is the idea? --- ANSWER: White intends g4, prying open Black's king. But I believe Black is still okay here. 13...Bd7 14.g4! : ( 14...Be8 15.Qh3 d4 16.Bf4 Nd5 17.Bd2 , J.Ibarra Jerez-M.Rivas Pastor, Ceuta 2008. Black looks okay if he plays 17...f4 18.Rb1 Qe7 19.O-O Kg8 20.Rb3 Rb8 21.Rfb1 g5 22.Be4 Kg7 . Houdini gives White a tiny plus here, while I wouldn't mind taking Black's side. ) ( . I also like Houdini's suggested defence 14...Qe8! 15.Qh4 Kg8 16.gxf5 exf5 17.Rg1 Rh7! ( 17...Nxe5? is strongly met with 18.Rxg7+! Kxg7 19.Bd4 with a ferocious attack ) 18.Qf4 Kh8 19.h4 Rd8 20.Bd4 Ne4 and I don't think Black stands worse and actually prefer his position instead. )

**13...Qxf6**

...e5 is coming.

**14.Qh5**

14.Nh4 e5 15.Ng6+ Kg8 : ( 16.Qf3 Rh7 17.Nf8 (the only move) 17...Rh8 18.Ng6 and a draw by repetition results. --- QUESTION: Can Black sac the exchange and play for a win based on his strategic advantages? --- ANSWER: It looks to me that this try is risky after 18...Qxf3 19.gxf3 Be6 20.Nxh8 Kxh8 21.Rg1 d4 22.Bd2 Na4 23.Bb5 Nxc5 24.Bb4 . White is growing more and more active and it looks like Black didn't get enough for the exchange. ) ( 16.Qh5?? has been played three times in my database and Black failed to find 16...e4! 17.Nxh8 Kxh8 18.Bf1 Be6 on every occasion. --- White is the exchange up at much too high a cost, since he is about to be pushed off the board. Houdini evaluates the position at -3.68, pretty much resignable for White. ( ) )

**14...e5**

Black's dominant pawn centre provides him with some measure of a barrier against confrontation.

**15.Bg6**

The bishop averts his gaze from Black's nearby queen, whom he brushes up against.

If instead 15.Nh4?? e4 16.Bf1 Kg8 17.Ng6 Be6 18.Nxh8 Kxh8 , the game transposes to the above note, which as indicated, is lost for White.

**15...Be6!**

A new move at the time. The bishop prepares to transfer to f7, where it challenges White's g6-bind.

**16.O-O**

QUESTION: Isn't White just winning after 16.Bg5 ? --- ANSWER: Black was ready with the countershot 16...Bg4! 17.Bxf6! Bxh5 18.Bxe5 ( 18.Bxg7+?! Kxg7 19.Bxh5 Rhg8 and White is the one struggling to coordinate, despite his extra pawn ) 18...Bxg6 19.Bxc3 Bxc2 with equality.

**16...Bf7**

Of course, White's bind on g6 must be vigorously challenged.

**17.Nh4 Re8?!**

Correct was 17...Kg8! 18.Rae1 Re8 19.f4 e4 20.f5 d4 with chances for both sides, J.Klovans-A.Ashby, Bad Zwischenahn 2008. Play may continue 21.Bf4 e3 and I slightly prefer Black, due to the deeply entrenched e-pawn which is more relevant than White's g6-bind.

**18.Rae1?!**

The comp points out the difficult-to-see line 18.Bd2! Ne4 ( 18...Na4 19.Rab1 and if 19...Nxc5 20.f4! e4 21.Bc3! Qxc3 22.Bxf7 , Black's position collapses ) 19.f4! exf4 ( 19...Nxd2?? loses on the spot to 20.fxe5 ) 20.Bxf7 Qxf7 21.Rxf4 Nf6 22.Qf5 Rh7 23.Bc3 and Black is in dire straits.

**18...Kg8 19.f3!?**

If Black manages to unravel from the g6-bind, he automatically seizes the advantage with his monster centre. The impermanent nature of White's initiative means he should take more vigorous action.

White's other option is the riskier 19.f4 e4 20.f5 d4 21.Bd2 Nd5 22.Rb1 Re7 23.Bxf7+ Qxf7 24.Ng6 Rd7 25.Qe2 (White's knight is for the moment more powerful than Black's useless h8-rook) 25...Nf6 26.Be1! Kh7 (forcing the loss of the exchange!) 27.Nxh8 Kxh8 and Houdini gives White the edge after 28.Bh4 though Black's central domination offers some measure of compensation.

**19...Re6!**

Black's longstanding policy of benevolent non-intervention comes to an end. White neglected to toss in f4 and f5, which means Black is in a position to challenge for control of the g6-square.

**20.Bxf7+ Qxf7 21.Qg4 Rf6 22.Bd2 Nb5 23.f4**

Better late than never.

**23...e4**

Black has a much better version than some of the above lines since White's domination of the g6-square has been broken.

**24.c4!**

Black's dominant centre must be smashed.

**24...Nxa3 25.cxd5 Qxd5 26.Re3?**

EXERCISE (combination alert): White plans to meet 26...Nc4 with Rg3! but with his last move, he overlooked something. How did Morozevich cross White's intent?

Correct was 26.Rf2! Ne5! 27.fxe5 Rxf2 28.Bb4 h5 29.Qg3 Nc2 30.Qxf2 Nxe1 31.Bxe1 Rh6 32.Nf5 Re6 with chances for both sides.

**26...h5!**

ANSWER: Zwischenzug/double attack. --- This move messes up the intended queen plus rook battery on g4 and g3.

Lanka probably expected 26...Nc4? 27.Rg3 .

**27.Qe2**

When someone jams a gun in the small of our back, we tend to be quite obliging.

After 27.Qg5 Qxg5 28.fxg5 Rxf1+ 29.Kxf1 Nc4 30.Rc3 ( 30.Re2?? Nd4 31.Rf2 e3 32.Bc3 exf2 33.Bxd4 Kh7 is hopeless for White ) 30...Nxd2+ 31.Ke1 Kf7 32.Kxd2 Rd8+ 33.Ke3 Ke6 34.Rc4 Kd5 , White is left suffering terribly in the ending.

**27...Nc4!**

Now this double attack is decisive.

**28.Rd1 Nd4!**

The cold-blooded kill from necessity; never from anger. Morozevich correctly spurns material over initiative.

The greedy 28...Nxe3 29.Bxe3 Qb3 30.f5 offers White some practical chances.

**29.Qf1 Kh7!?**

At long last, the h8-POW is released.

Moro once again weights his decision upon piece play rather than material, which he can win with 29...Qxc5 30.Rc1 b5 , which is exactly how I would play Black. If initiative-loving humans can learn a single lesson from comps, it is this one. Material matters, since it represents a real, tangible entity, while initiative tends to be more ephemeral.

**30.Rc3 Nxd2 31.Rxd2 Rd8**

Black emerged with an extra pawn and a dominant position.

**32.f5 g5?!**

Moro decides that if he blows this game, it certainly won't be through lack of enterprise. I'm not sure what brought on this sudden spasm of recklessness. Sometimes a potentially tainted idea insinuates its way into our brain, where it festers, like the administration of a slow poison. Black, in an attempt to activate the f6-rook, goes overboard in deliberately exposing his king. Some traits, like the tendency to overpress, are universal and don't depend upon a player's aptitude or intelligence level. Much in the same way, the below-average moth and the genius IQ moth are both drawn to the lamp's light. Their final thought upon contact with the burning bulb is usually "Ah, success!"

Black ends the game immediately with 32...e3! 33.Rxe3 Qxc5 34.Rf2 Nc2 35.Re4 Rfd6 (threat: ...Rd1) 36.Rc4 Qxc4! 37.Qxc4 Rd1+ 38.Rf1 ( or 38.Qf1 Ne3! ) 38...Ne3 and Black wins.

**33.fxg6+ Kg7 34.Qe1 Rdf8 35.Rc1 Kg8 36.g7 R8f7 37.h3 Qe5 38.Qe3**

Black still holds an edge but his advantage is nowhere near what it was before his hasty 32nd move.

**38...Nc6 39.Re2 Kxg7 40.Qxe4??**

EXERCISE (combination alert): White's last move was a blunder. How can Black exploit it?

White continues to resist after the correct 40.Rce1 .

**40...Qg5!**

ANSWER: Double attack/pin. --- Black's queen threatens the c1-rook, and ...Rf4 is also in the air.

**41.Qc4 Qg3!**

The queen, deeply resentful of neglect, decides to assert her personality on White's offside knight.

ANSWER #2: Also winning is 41...Na5! overloading White's queen. Following 42.Qc3 Qxh4 43.Qxa5 Qd4+! 44.Kh1 ( 44.Kh2 Qf4+ picks off the c1-rook ) 44...Rf1+ 45.Rxf1 Rxf1+ 46.Kh2 Qg1+! 47.Kg3 h4+! 48.Kxh4 Qd4+ 49.Kg5 : ( 49.Kg3 ("You have no power over me, " squeals White's king, in a little too-shrill voice) 49...Qf4# is mate! ) ( 49.g4 Qf6+ 50.g5 Qf4+ 51.Kh5 and the king's shame begins to take physical form. Now simplest is 51...Qf3+ winning the e2-rook and forcing mate as well. )

**42.Qa4**

White's knight is stranded since 42.Nf3?? loses instantly to 42...Rxf3 .

**42...Rf4**

The second double attack is fatal for White. One strange law of the martial arts movie universe is the fact that Bruce Lee would be surrounded by fifty-three underweight attackers, and oddly, their thug etiquette required that they come at him two at a time. I don't get it. Why not all fifty-three at once? In any case, Moro is determined to alter the trend by lunging with the totality of his attackers.

**43.Qa1+ R7f6 44.Rd1 Qxh4**

The errant h4-knight is finally taken to task and made to pay for past misdeeds.

**45.Rd7+ Kh6**

Black's king is annoyingly safe here.

**46.Kh2**

QUESTION: Isn't Black guilty of being indifferent to his pawns? Why can't White take the b7-pawn?

ANSWER: After 46.Rxb7 , White's defenders are too diffused to offer resistance. Black's attack/initiative achieves unstoppable momentum after 46...Nd4 47.Re8 Rf1+ 48.Qxf1 Rxf1+ 49.Kxf1 Qf6+ : 50.Kg1 ( 50.Kg1 Nf3+! 51.Kf2 ( 51.gxf3 and White's g-pawn fails to qualify in his role of protector to the e8-rook as after 51...Qg6+ , the rook falls ) 51...Nd2+ 52.Ke1 Qf1+ 53.Kxd2 Qxg2+ wins the b7-rook. ) ( 50.Ke1 Nc2+ 51.Kd2 Qg5+! and Black follows with a series of deliberate knight hangs, all of which White is unable to exploit as he is busy starving off the attack. After 52.Kc3 Qxc5+ 53.Kb2 Qd4+! 54.Kc1 Qg1+! 55.Kb2 Qa1+ 56.Kxc2 Qa4+ , a pitiful moan from the direction of e8 indicates the acute state of suffering of the square's occupant. At last! Black's queen finally gets her heart's desire - a white rook. )

**46...Rf2 47.Qc1+**

Following 47.Rxf2 Qxf2 48.Rxb7 Qf4+ 49.Kg1 Nd4 50.Rxa7 Nf3+! 51.gxf3 Rg6+ 52.Kf2 Qd2+ 53.Kf1 Qg2+ 54.Ke1 Re6+ 55.Kd1 Qxf3+ , the queen sighs contentedly, strangely comforted by the king's pleas of mercy. "Nature provided you with the soul of a swine, and unfortunately for you, my destiny is to be your butcher," she gloats as after 56.Kc1 Re1+ , it is mate in two moves.

**47...Qf4+ 48.Qxf4+ R6xf4 49.Re8 Rf7 50.Re6+ Kg7**

. SUMMARY: I think Black gets dynamically balanced chances after 12...f5!, no matter how White responds.

0-1

### (70)Kurnosov, I.   --   Volkov, S. 49: Russian Ch Qualifier, St Petersburg  2004   0-1   C12 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.e5 h6 6.Be3 Ne4 7.Qg4 Kf8 8.a3 Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 Nxc3**

I like this move better than 9...c5, which we looked at in the last game. --- QUESTION: Why do you prefer to hold back on ...c5? --- ANSWER: White not only leads in development but also holds the bishop pair, so I feel it is in Black's best interest to avoid opening the game, even though 9...c5 does follow the principle: Counter in the centre when attacked on the wing. We agree to delay ...c5, not sign a contract which excludes the move forever. Hence, I prefer to toss in ...c5 only when Black catches up in development.

**10.Bd3 Nc6!?**

Volkov's specialty. The move is based on the non-confrontational philosophy - one cannot kill an enemy's reflection. The universe is divided into a pair of categories: Those who do and those who dream (your writer is a longstanding member of the latter). 10...c5 is proactive and aggressive, while 10...Nc6, which fits the dream category, delays the confrontation for a more appropriate date (hopefully never!).

**11.Nh3**

QUESTION: Why did White develop his knight on the rim, rather than on f3? --- ANSWER: White intends Nf4 and Nh5, targeting the g7-pawn.

After 11.Nf3 , we look at: ( 11...Ne7 12.Bd2 Na4 13.Rb1 Nb6 14.h4 Nc4 15.Bc1 c5!? ( once again, I would avoid such early game openings and play 15...b6 ) 16.Bxc4 dxc4 17.dxc5 Qa5+ 18.Nd2 Qxc5 19.O-O , P.Ponkratov-S.Volkov, Izhevsk 2009. At this point Houdini suggests 19...Bd7 20.Rxb7 Qd5 21.Rb1 Bc6 22.h5 g6!? (a radical move, signifying the computer intention to open the g-file for the h8-rook, even if it endangers Black's own king) 23.f3 c3 24.Nb3 Qxe5 25.Qb4 and Houdini declares it even. I think White may have a slight edge due to the fact that Black's rooks have yet to connect and his king seems to be in danger. ) ( 11...Na4 12.O-O Nb2 13.Be2 Nc4 14.Nd2 Nxd2 15.Bxd2 f5!? I don't like this move. ( Black can also play something a lot calmer, like 15...b6 ! intending ...Ne7, ...Bd7 and ...c5 ) 16.exf6 Qxf6 17.c3 e5 (a logical yet illogical move as Black frees his position but also opens the game for White's developmental lead and bishop pair) 18.Qg3 Bf5 19.Rae1 exd4 20.c4! d3 21.Bxd3 Bxd3 22.Qxd3 d4 23.Re4 Kg8 and Volkov managed to win but I think at this stage, White has more than enough compensation for the pawn, A.Naiditsch-S.Volkov, Stockholm 2011. )

11.h4 also looks logical. White may later lift his rook into the attack via h3. After 11...f5 12.Qf3 Ne7 13.g4 , A.Bezgodov-V.Korchnoi, Cheliabinsk 2007, chances look approximately balanced after 13...Kg8 14.Ne2 Nxe2 15.Qxe2 Qf8 .

**11...f5!**

Black has to start his counterattack now or White gets in Nf4 easily with a dominant position.

**12.Qh5**

This move may be a waste of time.

A look at White's other options: 12.Qg3 g5! 13.f4 g4 14.Nf2 Ne4 (the knight makes itself a nuisance): ( 15.Bxe4!? dxe4 16.h3 gxh3 17.Rxh3 Qe7 18.c4 b6 19.d5 Nd8 20.Qg6 Qg7 21.Qxg7+ Kxg7 22.g4 fxg4 23.Rh4 , A.Areshchenko-S.Volkov, Gibraltar 2006 and White has compensation for the pawn but not more after 23...h5 24.Nxe4 . ) ( 15.Nxe4 dxe4 16.Bc4 Nxd4 17.O-O-O c5 18.c3 Qa5 19.Kb2 ( 19.cxd4?? Qc3+ regains the piece with advantage ) 19...Qa4! 20.cxd4 Qxc4 21.Qh4! ( 21.dxc5 is met with 21...Bd7! with an edge to Black ) 21...Qe2+ 22.Ka1 Bd7 23.Qf6+ Kg8 24.Qg6+ with perpetual check. )

QUESTION: Shouldn't White open the position by taking en passant? --- ANSWER: Your logical-looking move has yet to be tried in the position. Let's take a look: 12.exf6 Qxf6 (now ...e5 is in the air) 13.O-O ( 13.Nf4 e5 14.dxe5 Nxe5 15.Qh5 Nxd3+ 16.cxd3 Bf5 17.Bd4 Qxd4 18.Qxf5+ Kg8 19.Qe6+ Kh7 20.Qg6+ is perpetual check ) 13...Kg8 14.Qh5 Bd7 15.Nf4 Nxd4 16.Bxd4 Qxd4 17.Ng6 Qf6 and Black gets excellent play if White grabs the h8-rook, with two pawns for the exchange. --- QUESTION: What if White refuses to take and just sits on g6 with the knight? How would Black unravel? --- ANSWER: The game may continue 18.Rae1 Rh7 19.Re3 Ne4 20.Rf3 Qg5 21.Qxg5 hxg5 22.Ne7+ Kh8 23.Ng6+ with perpetual check.

**12...Qe8!**

The white queen's bete noire turns up unexpectedly. White, who is a pawn down, can't afford to swap queens and the h3-square is occupied by White's knight, so White's queen must go to an inferior square.

**13.Qh4 Qe7 14.Bg5**

QUESTION: Why did White avoid the draw by repetition after 14.Qh5 Qe8 ? --- ANSWER: I think Volkov was simply testing his opponent. ( I am almost positive that Black, the higher rated player (and possessing an extra pawn) would have avoided the repetition with 14...Bd7! 15.Nf4 Be8 16.Qh3 g5 17.Bd2 Na4 18.Ne2 Kg7 . I just don't believe in White's compensation for the pawn anymore. )

**14...Qf7 15.f3 Kg8**

Now White's bishop really is hanging.

**16.Bd2 Na4 17.O-O Nb2!**

Destination: The c4-square.

**18.Be2**

White hangs on to his bishop pair, a now forlorn hope for compensation.

**18...Nc4 19.Bc3**

QUESTION: If opposite-coloured bishops favour the attacker, then why not go for the line 19.Bxc4 dxc4 ? --- ANSWER: The trouble is I'm not so sure White is the one attacking. Black looks like he is a pawn up with a clear strategic edge (based on the light square power of the opposite-coloured bishops which White had forced!) and after 20.Qf2 b6 21.Nf4 g5 22.Ne2 Bb7 , Black intends ...Ne7 and ...Nd5 with the strategic and material advantage.

**19...Bd7 20.Kh1 g5!**

Black renounces his pacifist stance with a war declaration. Old resentments have a nasty way of festering, followed by a growth spurt, which manifests externally as an outburst. Black, now emboldened, decides to make a grab for both space and initiative across the board.

**21.Qf2 b5!**

Houdini assesses at only -0.34, just an edge for Black. I think this is a big misassessment and trust more in the humans here. GM Neil McDonald writes: "Black's pawns form an impenetrable wall across the whole board. It is obvious that White has no compensation for his pawn, and he is slowly and horribly ground down."

**22.Rfb1 Rb8 23.Bb4 a6 24.Bc5 Nb6! 25.Bxb6!?**

Once this concession is made, others follow. White hands over the bishop pair and allows Black to open the c-file, which can't be right.

White was probably afraid of allowing Black's knight to a4, but this feels like the lesser evil after 25.Bd3 Na4 26.Bb4 .

**25...cxb6 26.a4**

White tries to activate his a1-rook at the cost of allowing Black a passed a-pawn.

**26...bxa4 27.Bxa6 Na5 28.Bb5?**

This swap isn't such a great idea since it allows Black's knight access to the newly weakened c4-square and swaps away the best defender of his already weak light squares.

**28...Bxb5**

By removing White's light square influence, Black further degrades White's capacity to resist.

**29.Rxb5 Qe8 30.Qf1 Nc4 31.Rb4 Ra8 32.Nf2**

EXERCISE (planning): An ocean of strategic riches spreads out before Black, as far as the eye and imagination are capable of seeing. Come up with a multi-step method for Black to continue to strengthen his position. --- ANSWER:

**32...Rh7!**

Step 1: Black's last undeveloped piece is brought into the fold.

**33.Nd3 Rc7**

Step 2: Black's rooks prepare to double, loading up on both the c3-square and the c2-pawn.

**34.Ra2 a3**

Step 3: Black's passed a-pawn strangles White's rooks on the queenside and ties his entire army down in general.

**35.c3 f4!**

Step 4: Open a second front on the kingside. Volkov refuses to relinquish his octopus-like grip. Now White must watch out for ...Qg6.

**36.Qc1**

36.Nf2 intending Ng4, is met with 36...h5 .

**36...Rac8 37.h3 Qg6 38.Ne1 Qf5 39.Kh2 h5!**

Step 5: Now White must watch out for ...g4 and ...g3 ideas. It feels like every passing move leaves White's position a shade worse than the last.

**40.Nc2 g4!**

It was Nietzsche who wrote: "One has attained mastery when one neither goes wrong nor hesitates in the performance." The a3-pawn isn't really hanging.

**41.Nxa3?**

Hey, I said "the a3-pawn isn't really hanging!" White may not have realized that he reached time control and possibly banged out the blunder instantaneously. We can all sympathize. Anyone who experiences habitual time-pressure comes to the realization that time is more a matter of perception than a finite reality. That, or the sheer weight of oppression, can induce this kind of move. White drops a piece but his position is close to resignable. --- QUESTION: How would Black break through if White just did nothing?

ANSWER: The method would be to go after White's king, while so many of his defenders are stuck on the queenside. For example, with 41.Rb3 , White treats the a3-pawn with the exaggerated discretion of one who believes in Black's threats, and in this instance, he is correct in his assumption! The game might continue 41...Ra7 42.Ne1 gxh3! (opening the g-file) 43.gxh3 Rg7 44.Qc2 Qf8 45.Qb1 Rg3 46.Qd3 Qg7 47.Qf1 Ne3 48.Qf2 Kh8 49.Rxb6 Rg8 (triplication isn't always synonymous with redundancy) 50.Rxe6 . --- EXERCISE (combination alert): The white king's chamber smells of sickness and looming death. Black to play and force mate in three moves. --- ANSWER: Deflection/overloaded defender. With 50...Nf1+! , the knight picks up a crowbar and waits for White's king around the corner. After 51.Qxf1 Rxh3+! 52.Qxh3 ( 52.Kxh3 runs into 52...Qg3# mate! ) 52...Qg1# is mate! The queen encourages others to freely express their opinions, just as long as they coincide with hers.

**41...g3+ 42.Kh1 Ra7 43.Rb3 Rca8**

. SUMMARY: Maybe this is a stylistic bias but I like the idea of avoiding an early ...c5 by playing Volkov's pet line 10...Nc6!?, which keeps the game closed.

0-1

### (71)Alozy, F.   --   Thirion, P. 50: Correspondence  2005   0-1   C12 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.e5 h6 6.Bc1**

QUESTION: Why on earth would White choose to undevelop a piece when he has perfectly good options for the bishop on d2 and e3? --- ANSWER: The 6 Bc1 McCutcheon is perhaps White's most ambitious try. White seeks to maximize the bishop's posting to a3, rather than e3. --- Apart from undeveloping a piece in a position which may soon open violently, another downside is that the white bishop does nothing to defend both c3- and d4-weak points.

**6...Ne4 7.Qg4**

The powerful and narcissistic queen once again gazes adoringly at her own beautiful reflection in the mirror.

**7...g6**

7...Kf8 is covered in the final game of the chapter.

Let's have a look at other lines: As usual, the greedy 7...Nxc3?? is not to be considered. White is winning after 8.Qxg7 Kd7 ( 8...Ne4+? 9.c3 is even worse for Black ) 9.Bd2 when Black is busted.

I don't trust the voluntarily weakening 7...g5!? although Houdini evaluates it as fully playable. After 8.Ne2 c5 9.a3 Ba5 10.dxc5 Qc7 11.b4 Nxc3 12.Nxc3 Qxe5+ 13.Kd2 Bc7 14.Bb2 Nc6 15.Re1 Qf4+ 16.Qxf4 Bxf4+ 17.Kd1 O-O 18.h4 g4 , Black looks okay, although I still prefer White's position, Z.Andriasian-J.Stopa, Benasque 2011.

**8.Ne2**

White's overwhelming choice in the position. --- QUESTION: Why not play the same strategy as the 6 Be3 lines and play 8 a3? --- ANSWER: Tossing in a3 doesn't make as much sense since it removes White's entire idea of posting a bishop on a3 by making the a-pawn occupy the square reserved for the bishop.

After 8.a3 Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 , let's examine the following options: ( 9...c5 10.Bd3 Nxc3 . Essentially we reach a position from the 6 Be3 lines, where White's bishop is undeveloped on c1, rather than on e3. If 11.dxc5 , Black should not play 11...Qa5?! , as ( better is 11...Qc7! 12.Nf3 Nd7 13.Qb4 Qxc5 14.Bb2 Ne4 and returning the pawn offers Black dynamic equality ) 12.Qb4! gives White the advantage, J.Hector-S.Brynell, Lidkoeping 1999. ) ( . For those readers greedy or brave enough, they can try the riskier 9...Nxc3!? 10.Bd3 Na4 when White's attacking chances offer compensation for the pawn. But note that in this version, White's bishop may actually be better off on c1, since Black lacks the tempo-gaining trick ...Nb2 which can be used in the 6 Be3 versions. )

**8...c5**

In the next game, we will look at the immediate, unprovoked capture 8...Nxc3!? .

**9.a3 Ba5**

With the idea of hanging on to the dark-squared bishop for as long as possible.

Conversely, after 9...Bxc3+ 10.bxc3 cxd4 11.cxd4 , F.Vallejo Pons-T.Radjabov, Linares 2003, Houdini recommends 11...Qa5+ 12.c3 Bd7 13.f3 Bb5! 14.fxe4 Bxe2 15.Qg3 Bxf1 16.Rxf1 dxe4 17.Kf2 Nc6 18.Kg1 Rd8 and claims equality. I prefer White due to the pressure down the f-file and potential play on the dark squares. These factors should be more advantageous than Black's power on the light squares.

**10.dxc5**

White opens the position, banking on the coming acquisition of the bishop pair.

The alternative is 10.b4 Nxc3 : ( 11.Nxc3 cxd4 12.Nb5 Bc7 13.f4 Bd7 14.Nxd4 Nc6 and I would be comfortable with Black, A.Cantore-G.Guidi, correspondence 1991. ) ( . After 11.bxa5 , Houdini likes 11...Ne4! 12.f3 Qxa5+ 13.c3 cxd4! 14.fxe4 d3! and Black favourably regains the piece. Following 15.Bd2 dxe2 16.Bxe2 dxe4 17.Qf4 Qc5 18.Rb1 Nd7 , Houdini rates at 0.00. --- Perhaps this is just a French player's bias talking, but I just don't believe White's bishop pair and developmental lead make up for the two pawns and structural damage White sustained to reach this position. ( ) )

**10...Nxc3**

White may hold an edge after this move.

Perhaps more accurate is 10...Qc7! : ( . After 11.b4?! , Black stands better. Following 11...Nxc3 12.Qf4 Ne4 13.f3 Nxc5 , E.Mikalsen-H.Tikkanen, London 2011, I don't trust in White's full compensation after 14.bxa5 Ncd7 . ) ( . Correct was 11.Qf4 Nxc3 12.Nxc3 Bxc3+ 13.bxc3 Qxc5 14.Bd2 Nd7 15.Bd3 Qc7 16.O-O Qxe5 17.Qb4 a5 18.Qa4 Kf8 when White's bishop pair, dark-square control and attacking chances should compensate for Black's extra pawn. ( ) )

**11.Nxc3 Bxc3+ 12.bxc3 Qc7 13.Qf4**

13.Qg3! looks more accurate, P.Darini-M.Hamal, Incheon 2013. I think the opposite-coloured bishops may slightly favour White after 13...Nd7 14.Bb5 Kf8 15.Bxd7 Bxd7 16.a4 .

**13...Qxc5**

Black's move looks better than 13...Nc6 14.Bb5 Bd7 when the opposite-coloured bishops give White the edge since Black's dark squares look weaker than White's light squares, M.Bergmann-W.Schubert, correspondence 2008, especially after 15.Bxc6 Bxc6 16.O-O .

**14.Bb2**

Somewhat artificial.

I prefer posting the bishop on d2 to keep aim at Black's kingside after 14.Bd2! Nd7 15.Bd3 b6 16.O-O a5 17.Rfe1 Ba6 18.Re3 when even here, Black looks okay to me.

**14...Bd7 15.c4!?**

This looks premature.

White may still stand a microbe better after 15.Bd3 Bb5 16.O-O Nd7 17.a4 .

**15...Bc6**

Black should jump at the chance to remove queens from the board with 15...Qa5+! 16.Qd2 Qxd2+ 17.Kxd2 dxc4 18.Bxc4 Bc6 19.f3 Nd7 and Black's better structure makes up for White's space and bishop pair.

**16.cxd5**

16.Bc3! Nd7 17.Bb4 Qb6 18.cxd5 Bxd5 19.c4 Bc6 looks slightly better for White.

**16...Bxd5 17.c4**

The c-pawn, a boxer warming up before the fight, is eager to get into the mix, rolling his shoulders and throwing punches into the air. The more White invests in reckless pawn pushes in this game, the greater his future disillusionment. Also, this move allows Black to favourably remove queens from the board.

Instead, 17.f3! retains queens on the board.

**17...Qa5+!**

Black's queen winks at White's king as she passes by, an action he deems in extremely poor taste. As mentioned earlier, removal of queens can only help Black, since it effectively removes mating worries.

**18.Qd2**

"I loathe your existence," White's queen tells her sister.

**18...Qxd2+**

"And I, yours," she replies with a smile.

**19.Kxd2 Bc6 20.Ke3 Nd7**

I prefer Black's chances in the ending. White's bishop pair is no big deal but his structural damage is a permanent issue to worry about.

**21.Rd1 Ke7 22.Rg1**

22.Bc3 is met simply with 22...Nc5 23.Bb4 b6 .

**22...Ba4 23.Rd3!?**

23.Rd6 looks safer.

**23...Rhc8 24.Rd2?**

Handing over a pawn.

After 24.Be2 Rc5 25.f4 Nb6 26.Rd4 Rac8 27.Rc1 , Black stands better but it isn't easy for him to make progress since 27...Bb5?? is met with the tactic 28.a4! intending Ba3.

**24...Nb6**

This wins the pawn but allows opposite-coloured bishops which may help White's drawing chances.

I would be more inclined to go for a knight versus bishop, pawn up ending after 24...Bb3 25.Bd3 Nb6 26.Rc1 Bxc4 27.Rdc2 Bxd3 28.Kxd3 Kd7 29.Bd4 Rxc2 30.Rxc2 Nd5 . I feel that Black should convert the point from here.

**25.Bd4 Nxc4+ 26.Bxc4 Rxc4 27.Bb2 Bc6 28.f3 Rc8 29.g4?!**

QUESTION: What objection do you have to White getting active? --- ANSWER: An initiative - even an illusory one - does provide a certain measure of psychological comfort. White somehow feels as if deadlines loom and there is a sense of urgency in the air. This move weakens f3 and White may have been better off without his last move.

**29...Bd5 30.Rg3 Kf8 31.g5?**

We all react differently to changing circumstances. However, such disruptions of the natural order always come with unintended consequences. I have never really understood why smoking and overeating have always been regarded as honourable forms of suicide, while drinking and drugs are generally looked down upon as the coward's way out. This seems to be the case here, where White seems to be addicted to pushing pawns - with the only purpose being to invoke their own demise. When the weaker side makes a headlong charge into a more powerful enemy's position, some call it valour, while others may label it suicidal. The last thing you want to do when you are passively defending is to weaken your bits for the sake of generating "activity". In this case, White pushes well past prudent or even tolerable limits.

White should sit tight and wait with 31.Rgg2 when Black would have a much harder time making progress.

**31...hxg5 32.Rxg5**

EXERCISE (planning): Black's active pieces have too much of a headstart over their white counterparts. Come up with a clear plan for Black to take advantage of White's numerous weaknesses. The key question is which pawn or pawns should Black target? --- ANSWER: Pile up on the f3-pawn which is White's weakest link. Then switch to subsidiary targets, the h2-pawn and even the a3-pawn.

**32...Rh4 33.Rg4 Rh3 34.Rg3 Rh5 35.Rgg2 Kg7!**

Preparing to swing the c8-rook to h8.

**36.Rc2 Rch8 37.Bd4 a6 38.Bc5?**

Some problems have a way of solving themselves. This just hangs the e5-pawn.

Black also has winning chances after 38.Rgf2 Rf5 (idea: ...Rh3) 39.Rc3 ( 39.f4 Rh3+ 40.Kd2 and 40...Rxa3 nabs a pawn ) 39...Rh3 40.Ke2 g5! when every available ounce of energy is utilized. Black intends to swing the king to f5 and following 41.Re3 Rf4 (Black's paranoid rooks can't seem to decide upon which of their numerous enemies to kill first) 42.Bc5 Kg6 43.Bb6 Kf5 44.Rc3 Bc6 45.Bc7 Rfh4 , the black rook's infatuation with the f3-pawn ends, as they switch their attentions to the h2-pawn, which falls. White's position reminds us of the feelings experienced by a prisoner, who having secretly and diligently tunnelled for the past twelve years, gets transferred from his cell to another, on the day before the planned escape.

**38...Rxe5+**

. The e5-pawn's reproachful, hurt expression reminds us of the trout, having been yanked from the river, coming face to face with the fisherman. --- SUMMARY: Let's take the unnatural-looking 6 Bc1 seriously. White scores well with it in the database and it appears to be every bit as dangerous as its 6 Be3 cousin.

0-1

### (72)Topalov, V.   --   Vallejo Pons, F. 51: Leon Masters, Spain  2012   0-1   C12 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.e5 h6 6.Bc1 Ne4 7.Qg4 g6 8.Ne2 Nxc3!?**

Radical stuff. Black chops on c3 unprovoked, without even waiting for a3. --- QUESTION: Why is Black willing to basically toss away a tempo, rather than to wait for White to toss in a3? --- ANSWER: In some of the a3 lines, Black must deal with ...Ba5 and then b4. By exchanging immediately on c3, Black deprives White of this option.

**9.bxc3**

After the other recapture with 9.Nxc3 c5 10.a3 , Black has two general choices: ( . The less accurate 10...Qa5 11.Bd2 cxd4 12.Qxd4 Nc6 13.Bb5 Qxb5 14.Nxb5 Nxd4 15.Nxd4 Bc5 16.Nb3 Bb6 17.Ba5 Bxa5+ 18.Nxa5 b6 19.Nb3 with an edge for White since the knight is superior to Black's remaining bishop, M.Pavlicek-J.Ebner, correspondence 2010. ) ( . A better option is 10...Bxc3+ 11.bxc3 Qa5 12.Bd2 Qa4! (pressuring both the c2- and d4-pawns as well as setting up ...Nc6/...Nxe5! tricks) 13.Qf3 (White must hand over a pawn but gets full compensation for it) 13...cxd4 14.Bd3 dxc3 15.Bxc3 , J.Nilsson-V.Turkov, correspondence 2011. At this point, I would play 15...a5!? to prevent Bb4. Play may continue 16.O-O b6 17.Qf6 O-O 18.Bxg6 Nd7! (zwischenzug) 19.Bxf7+ Rxf7 20.Qg6+ Rg7 21.Qxe6+ Kh7 22.Qxd5 Ra7 23.e6 Nc5 24.Bxg7 Bxe6 25.Qd4 Rxg7 26.Qxa4 Nxa4 with approximately balanced chances. ( ) )

**9...Ba5 !**

A new idea and I believe an improvement over dropping the bishop back to e7. --- QUESTION: Doesn't Black's last move play into White's hands, since it allows White's bishop access to a3? --- ANSWER: Black's amazing idea: 1. Run White's dark square bishop off the a3-f8 diagonal with ...Nd7!, intending ...Nb6 and ...Nc4, just as he did in the game. --- 2. Ensure White's knight is stuck babysitting the c3-pawn, thanks to Black backing the bishop to a5. --- 3. Hem in White's light-squared bishop as a result, and White will be unable to play Bxc4 when Black's knight lands on c4.

Of course, playable is 9...Be7 10.Nf4 c5 , E.Najer-I.Glek, Istanbul 2003. Play might continue 11.Bd3 Qa5 12.Bd2 Nc6 13.c4 Qa4 14.cxd5 Qxd4 15.O-O exd5 16.Qf3 c4 17.c3 Nxe5 18.Qg3 Qc5 19.Bc2 . It looks to me like White gets full compensation for the two pawns in the form of a developmental lead and attacking chances.

**10.Ba3 Nd7!**

Destination - The c4-square.

**11.h4**

QUESTION: Can't White disrupt Black's intention with 11.Qg3 Nb6 12.Nf4 since now the c4-square is covered by White's f1-bishop? --- ANSWER: That plan is playable but the trouble with it is that the c3-pawn loses a defender. Black can switch plans with 12...Bd7 13.Rb1 Na4! . Now if White refuses to play Bb4, he has to enter 14.Nh5!? which is met with 14...Qg5! which is the only move, but still a good one. After 15.Nf6+ Kd8 16.Bb4 Qxg3 17.fxg3 Nxc3! 18.Rb3 Bxb4 19.Rxb4 Bc6 20.Kd2 Na4 , I don't believe in White's compensation for the pawn since queens have been removed from the board.

**11...Nb6 12.Bb4**

White should probably switch plans with 12.h5! g5 13.f4 Nc4 14.Bc1 f5! . Now White must allow Black to favourably block the kingside or enter the wild line which Houdini works out to a draw after 15.exf6! e5! 16.Qg3! ( 16.Qf3 ? is met with 16...e4 17.Qg3 g4! with a clear advantage to Black ) 16...exf4 and now White has no choice but to go for it with 17.Nxf4! . When a position becomes too crazy to calculate, we then have no choice but to turn to inductive reasoning, which in this case is "Why the hell not!". Two tornados clash and intertwine in the middle, creating a perfect storm of complications. Of course this isn't an attack undertaken by anyone sane, but in this case, it happens to work out okay for White. After 17...gxf4 18.Qg6+ Kd7 19.Bxc4 Bxc3+ 20.Kf1 , we reach an arcane situation. --- When I was a kid, my family had this strange ping-pong table in the basement. Over the years, the Montreal cold and damp weather transformed the table into a warped, Quasimodo-shaped monstrosity, where superior table-tennis skill took a backseat to pure chance. Somehow this warped position reminds me of our old table. 20...Bxa1 ( Black can also play for a win with 20...Bxd4!? 21.Rb1 Qxf6 22.Bxd5 c6 23.Bf3 b6 24.Qxf6 Ba6+ 25.Be2 Bxe2+ 26.Kxe2 Bxf6 27.Bxf4 Be5! 28.Rhd1+ Ke6 29.Rb4 Bxf4 30.Rxf4 Rhf8 31.Re4+ Kf5 with an equal ending ) 21.Bb5+ and Black has a badly weakened garrison with two options: 1. Stand his ground to face inevitable defeat with 21...c6?? ( 2. Run! Black's king wisely opts for 21...Ke6 22.Qg4+ Kf7 23.Qg6+ Ke6 24.Qg4+ with perpetual check. What a delight, when the universe gifts a gambler with a pair of unforeseen aces from the deck ) 22.Qf7+ Kd6 23.Bxf4# mate!

**12...Bxb4**

Mission accomplished. White's dark-square influence has been significantly reduced and Black stands better, despite Houdini's proclamation of equality.

**13.cxb4 Qe7 14.a3 a5!**

Further loosening White's queenside pawns.

**15.b5**

QUESTION: Why weaken when White can stand his ground with 15 c3 instead?

ANSWER: 15.c3?! destabilizes White's queenside after 15...axb4 16.cxb4 Nc4 17.Qh3 Nxa3! 18.Ra2! ( 18.Rxa3?? Qxb4+ 19.Rc3 Ra1+ 20.Kd2 Bd7! 21.Ke3 Bb5 and White's position collapses ) 18...Qxb4+ 19.Qc3 c5 20.dxc5 Qb1+ 21.Nc1 Ra4 22.h5 g5 23.f3 and Black unravels with 23...Nb5! .

**15...Nc4 16.Qf3?!**

There is no time for gradual acclimatization and White must take violent action or risk perishing with hesitation. After this, White faces a succession of nasty reverses on the queenside and centre, which he bears with ill-grace. He stands worse and experiences great difficulty shaking off Black's harassing queenside pressure.

He should gamble with 16.Nc3! Nxa3 17.Qd1 b6 18.Qc1 Nc4 19.Bxc4 dxc4 20.Ne4 Qb4+ 21.c3 Qxb5 22.Nf6+ Kd8 and we arrive in a situation which induces an elevated pulse. White's dominating knight and chances to make headway later on the kingside may fully compensate for Black's two extra pawns. Houdini assesses this position at 0.00.

**16...Bd7 17.a4 Qb4+! 18.Nc3**

No real choice,

since 18.Qc3 c6! will cause the collapse of White's queenside borders.

**18...Na3!**

Threatening the c2-pawn and seizing control over the b1-square.

**19.Qd3**

Although 19.O-O-O?! may be legal, that doesn't mean it's good! Black pries open the queenside with 19...c6! with a clear advantage.

**19...Rc8!**

Vallejo relentlessly pursues his queenside agenda, this time intending ...c5, adding heat to White's beleaguered c3- and c2-points.

**20.Be2**

Houdini thinks White should go into pure passivity mode with 20.Qd2 c5 21.bxc6 Rxc6 22.Rh3 Rc7 23.Bb5 with an inferior but still playable position.

**20...c5 21.O-O cxd4 22.Nxd5!**

Discovered attack on a3. If not for this, White can resign.

**22...exd5 23.Rxa3 Bf5 24.Qg3!?**

The queen harbours a delusional belief in her own infallibility. Topalov decides not to grovel and accepts a position where he only gets fishing chances for two pawns. The result of White's campaign will produce one of two possible results: 1. A glorious victory for White in the distant future. --- 2. Slow death for White. --- At the moment, the smart money looks favourably upon number two.

24.Qf3! puts up maximum resistance after 24...O-O 25.Rb3 Qxa4 26.Bd3 Bxd3 27.Rxd3 ( 27.Qxd3?! is met with 27...Qc4! ) 27...Qxb5 28.Rxd4 Rxc2 29.Rxd5 Rc5 30.Rxc5 Qxc5 31.e6 Qe5 32.Qxb7 Qxe6 when conversion of the extra pawn may not be so easy.

**24...Rxc2 25.Rb3 Qxa4 26.Bd1 Rc1 27.e6 O-O**

Of course Black just ignores it and castles his way to relative safety.

**28.exf7+ Rxf7**

White simply lacks compensation for his two-pawn deficit.

**29.h5 g5?**

This natural move is a blunder.

Black wins with 29...Qc4! and if 30.hxg6 Re7! (with the deadly threat ...Qxf1+!) 31.f4 d3 (setting up ...Rxd1! and ...Qxb3) 32.Rb2 Re6 when Black dominates.

**30.Rb1! Qc4 31.Rxc1 Qxc1**

EXERCISE (critical decision): White has run out of time for tests or trial runs. His existence depends upon making the correct decision. He has choice of two tempting discovered attacks, 32 Bf3 and 32 Bb3. Only one allows him fully back into the game. The remedy is in our hands. All which is required is for us to swallow it. Which one would you play?

**32.Bb3?**

That which appears to be a highly agreeable bargain for White, also contains within the small print, a contaminating element. It appears as if 32 Bb3 and 32 Bf3 do the same thing but they don't. It becomes easy to impute the motive behind this move - White plans to respond to Black's future ...Be4 with f3. However he overlooked something.

ANSWER: Correct was 32.Bf3! Qc5 33.Qe5 Qe7 when Black's defenders scatter in panic, like bungling burglars who inadvertently trip an alarm. After 34.Qxd4 Be4 35.Bxe4 dxe4 36.Qb6! , White's counterplay should be enough to hold the draw.

**32...Qc5 33.Qe5 Be4 34.f3 d3+ 35.Kh2**

White's king admires Black's queen, yet is wise enough to do so at as great a distance as possible. Now the trouble is White no longer threatens fxe4 due to the hanging f1-rook.

**35...d2! 36.Rd1**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Black can sac on f3 with two different pieces. Which one is correct?

36.fxe4 Rxf1 37.Bxd5+ Kh7 38.Bg8+ Kxg8 39.Qxc5 d1=Q leaves Black up a rook and White has no perpetual check.

**36...Bxf3?**

The wrong piece, after which White may escape.

ANSWER: Black can do much better with 36...Rxf3! 37.Bxd5+! ( 37.gxf3?? Qf2+ 38.Kh3 Qxf3+ 39.Qg3 Qxh5+ 40.Qh4 Qxh4# mate! The queen takes exquisite pleasure in the misfortune of her enemies ) 37...Bxd5 38.Rxd2 Re3 39.Qxd5+ Qxd5 40.Rxd5 Kf7 with Black up a pawn and having excellent winning chances.

**37.Rxd2 Be4 38.Bxd5 Bxd5 39.Rxd5**

Black's exposed king should allow White to hold the draw.

**39...Qe7 40.Qb8+**

Slightly inaccurate.

White should hold the balance after 40.Qd4! .

**40...Rf8 41.Qg3 Rf4 42.Qd3??**

EXERCISE (combination alert): The white queen's unwarranted optimism is trying to those who attempt to reason with her. White's last move was a huge blunder. How did Black finish?

Correct was 42.Qc3! a4 43.Qd2 which still leaves White with excellent chances to hold the game.

**42...Rh4+!**

. ANSWER! --- One can't help but to admire the barbarous grandeur of the finish.

After 42...Rh4+! 43.Kg3 ( 43.Kg1 Qe1+ 44.Qf1 and "Fe, fi, fo...!" roars White's queen, believing herself an indestructible giant walking among puny creatures which surround her. Unfortunately she never had time to utter the intended "fum!" since an arrow lodged in her throat with 44...Rh1+! picking off White's queen ) 43...Qe1+ 44.Kf3 Rf4# mate! "You deceived me!" rages the king. The queen corrects him with "You deceived yourself." --- SUMMARY: I like the illogical-looking and rarely played 8...Nxc3!? since Vallejo's 9...Ba5! poses difficult new problems for White and may be an improvement over dropping the bishop back to the e7-square.

0-1

### (73)Bruzon Batista, L.   --   Short, ND. 52: Capablanca Memorial, Havana  2010   0-1   C12 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.e5 h6 6.Bc1 Ne4 7.Qg4 Kf8**

Defending the g-pawn with the king as in Game 48. --- QUESTION: In general, do you favour the ...g6 or ...Kf8 versions? --- ANSWER: Personally, I prefer the ...Kf8 versions, but this is from the bias of a positional player, who looks upon any weakening pawn move (such as ...g6!) as worse than a trip to the dentist. The ...g6 versions tend to be slightly more popular but really it's just a matter of taste which line you go with. However, after having analysed this game, I think maybe Black should go with the ...g6 version when White plays 6 Bc1, since I couldn't find a way for Black to fully equalize after the opening. I intend to play the way Vallejo Pons did in the previous game against the 6 Bc1 line.

**8.Ne2**

QUESTION: If White offers a pawn with 8.a3 , should Black grab it? --- ANSWER: I would, especially since White's a3 is counterproductive to his goal of getting his bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal. After 8...Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 Nxc3 10.Bd3 , A.Bubir-A.Haugen, correspondence 2012, I like the idea of holding off ...c5 and playing 10...Bd7 with the idea of ...Na4 and ...Nb6, keeping the game closed as long as possible. White may have full compensation for the pawn, but stylistically, most French Defence players would prefer Black.

**8...c5 9.a3**

9.f3 Nxc3 10.bxc3 Ba5 11.Ba3 Nd7 and I already prefer Black since White lacks concrete compensation for his weakened queenside pawns, S.Law-J.Wheeler, correspondence 2004.

**9...Ba5**

Black's main move.

He can also take on c3 via 9...Bxc3+ 10.bxc3 cxd4 11.cxd4 Nc6 12.c3 Qa5 13.Be3 (of course the c3-pawn isn't really hanging due to the pin) 13...Ne7 14.Qh3 (threatening f3!), V.Yemelin-S.Volkov, Voronezh 2012. Chances look balanced after 14...Nf5 15.g4 Nxe3 16.Qxe3 Bd7 17.f3 Ng5 18.h4 Nh7 as White's kingside expansion and Black's coming pressure down the c-file look like they may balance out.

**10.dxc5**

This looks more reliable than to break the pin with 10.b4 Nxc3 ( 10...cxb4? 11.Nxe4 dxe4 12.axb4 Bxb4+ 13.c3 Be7 14.Ng3 is clearly in White's favour since Black lacks any method of chipping away at White's dominating centre ) 11.bxa5 Nxe2 12.Bxe2 cxd4 13.O-O Qxa5 14.a4 (White refuses to take time out to capture the d4-pawn, resulting in him having justify compensation for two pawns - a high bar. After 14...Nc6 15.Ba3+ Kg8 16.Bd6 Qd2 17.Bd3 h5 18.Qh4 g5! 19.Qh3 Qf4 20.g3 Qf3 21.Rae1 h4 , I don't see a trace of compensation for White's missing pawns, as Black holds the initiative, F.Decoster-B.Michiels, Belgium 2007.

**10...Nd7**

QUESTION: Why doesn't Black smash White's structure with 10...Nxc3 11.Nxc3 Bxc3+ 12.bxc3 ? --- ANSWER: The damage didn't come without a price as Black handed over his powerful dark-squared bishop. 12...Nc6 13.Qg3 Qa5 14.Bd2 Qxc5 15.Bd3 d4?! ( 15...b6 looks more reliable but even here, I prefer White's attacking chances ) 16.f4 dxc3 17.Be3 Qe7 18.O-O Black is in big trouble, since White's space, bishop pair, dark-square control and attacking chances clearly outweigh Black's measly extra pawn, L.Fressinet-V.Meier, Biel 2009.

**11.b4 Nxe5 12.Qh5!**

More accurate than 12.Qh3 Bc7 13.Nd4 Nc6! 14.Nxc6 Qf6! 15.Qf3 bxc6 16.Qxf6 Nxf6 when I prefer Black due to superior central control, B.Savchenko-S.Volkov, Erpukhov 2008.

**12...Bc7 13.Nxe4 dxe4 14.Bb2 Qg5!**

Black's queen deals with her sister's admonitions with a suppressed yawn. Short wisely encourages queens off the board. Black must still play very carefully since White leads in development even in the ending.

**15.Qxg5**

White's machinery is so resilient that it continues to function effectively, even without its chief operator.

**15...hxg5 16.Nc3**

White stands slightly better in the ending, mainly due to his nagging developmental lead.

**16...e3**

16...f5 17.Nb5 Bb8 18.Nd6 Bxd6 19.cxd6 looks better for White, with bishop pair and a deeply passed d-pawn.

**17.fxe3**

This lets Black off the hook.

White stands better after 17.O-O-O! a6 18.Ne4 Rh4! 19.f3! ( Black looks okay after 19.Nxg5 Ng4 ) 19...Rxe4! 20.fxe4 Ng4 21.Bc4 Nf2 22.Rhe1 Nxd1 23.Kxd1 Bd7 24.Rxe3 Bc6 ( Black can't touch the h2-pawn due to 24...Bxh2?? 25.Rh3 ) 25.g3 Rd8+ 26.Ke2 Ke7 and Black has some but probably not full compensation for the pawn, with reasonable drawing chances. White shouldn't play 27.Bxg7? due to 27...f6 28.e5 Bxe5 29.Rxe5 fxe5 30.Bxe5 when he will be the one fighting for the draw.

**17...Ng4**

Black regains the pawn with a dynamically even game.

**18.Be2**

After 18.Nb5 Bg3+! 19.Ke2 Rxh2 20.Rxh2 Nxh2 21.Nd6 b6 22.c4 Bxd6 23.cxd6 Ba6 24.b5 Bb7 25.a4 f6 , the position is equal.

**18...Bg3+!**

This annoying zwischenzug ensures Black an equal ending.

**19.Kd2 Nf2 20.Rhg1 Rxh2 21.Raf1 f5!**

Principle: If you have a pawn majority on one side, push it. Each side holds a four to two pawn majority and the key for both players is to urge their own majorities forward, while stalling the opponent's one for as long as possible.

**22.Kc1 Ke7 23.b5**

This move loosens White's position.

Much stronger was 23.Nd1! Nxd1 24.Kxd1 Kf7 25.Rf3 Bc7 26.Rh3 Rxh3 27.gxh3 Bd8 28.Bf3 Bf6 29.Bxf6 Kxf6 with balanced chances.

**23...g4**

Stronger is 23...Rh4! and if White tries to eject the f2-intruder with 24.Nd1? , Black has 24...Ne4! 25.Bxg7 ( 25.Rh1 is met with 25...Bh2! ) 25...Bh2! and the latter wins material.

**24.Bc4 Bh4 25.Kb1 g3 26.a4?!**

26.e4! f4 27.Ne2 g5 28.Be5 and White may be able to maintain an uneasy balance after 28...Nxe4 29.Rd1 Nf2 30.Rd2 .

**26...Bf6 27.Be2 g5**

Both sides move forward their respective pawn majorities, yet Black's advance feels more potent since White remains tied down to defence of the g2-pawn.

**28.Ka2 g4!**

Cutting off Bf3 possibilities.

**29.Kb3 Bd7 30.Ba3 Kf7 31.a5 Be5**

Black can also go after the c5-pawn with 31...Rc8! 32.Bb4 Be7 33.a6! (this pawn sac generates counterplay down the a-file) 33...bxa6 34.Ra1! Bxb5 35.Nxb5 axb5 36.Rxa7 Kf6 37.Bc3+ e5 38.Ra6+ Kf7 39.Bxe5 Ne4 40.Kb2 Nxc5 41.Ra7 Ne4 42.Bd3! with equality. ( 42.Bxb5?? hangs a piece to 42...Rc5 . )

**32.Bb4 Rc8 33.Bc4 Kf6 34.Re1**

I would play 34.Ra1! with the idea of a5-a6.

**34...Bxc3!?**

Short gives away the bishop pair to clear the way for ...e5 and eventually ...f4.

**35.Bxc3+ e5**

EXERCISE (planning/critical decision): White's focus subdivides into a choice of two tempting plans: Plan A - Consider the strategic exchange sac of possibly reckless undertones with 36 Rd1 Nxd1 37 Rxd1. Is this a case of optimism outrunning discretion? --- Plan B - Play 37 a6 with the intention of 37...bxa6 38 Ra1, generating play down the a-file. One plan leads to a losing position while White should hold the draw with the other. Which one would you play?

**36.Rd1?**

A psychologist is unable to unearth any dark truths about White's rook that the general public isn't already aware of. White's last move is openly declaring "Test me all you like. I will not bend to your will." When players are evenly matched, it is often random anomalies which prove the undoing of one or the other, by shifting the scale. In this instance, Bruzon believes he spots just such an anomaly. White's decision is an overreaction based on the philosophy - Later is rarely as good as sooner. In the heat of a chess game, the way we perceive rarely equates to the actual nature of the object. White bore his suffering with stoic silence, until now. The rook sees himself as one born to command. However, nobody else views him this way. I'm all for the little guy standing up and asserting himself against Goliath. But is it wise for the d1-guppy to do so against the Great White Shark on f2? As it turns out, White, by refusing to live within his means, ends up earning a lot less than he wished for in this ill-advised transaction.

White remains equal after: ANSWER: Plan B - 36.a6! bxa6 37.Ra1! axb5 38.Bd5 Rxc5 39.Ra6+ ! .

**36...Nxd1 37.Rxd1**

EXERCISE (planning/critical decision): It appears as if White has generated alarming threats. The d7-bishop hangs and Rd5 is also in the air. But Black has everything under control, conditional upon finding the correct plan: Plan A - Just ignore the hanging bishop on d7 and make it a pure race with 37 ...Rxg2 38 Rxd7 Rxc5. --- Plan B - If Black is going to give up the bishop, then let's get something for it with 37...Bxb5. One plan gives Black a winning game; the other gives him only an edge. Which one would you play?

**37...Bxb5?!**

Possibly a counter-overreaction! Houdini doesn't like this move, which effectively destroys White's queenside pawn majority.

ANSWER: Black should go for Plan A - with 37...Rxg2! which is Houdini's choice. Black is faster after 38.Rxd7 Rxc5 . Now if White attempts to make a race of it with 39.Rxb7? , Black promotes first after 39...Rg1! (threats: ...Rb1+ and also ...g2): ( 40.b6 Rb1+ 41.Ka2 Rxc4 42.Kxb1 g2 and Black queens with check. The most annoying aspect of zombies is that killing them once does not get the job done. The g-pawn transforms into a new, deadly incarnation, once it reaches g1. After 43.bxa7 g1=Q+ 44.Kb2 Qxe3! , Black no longer has to worry about White's promotion ideas. Following 45.a8=Q Qxc3+ 46.Kb1 Qxc2+ 47.Ka1 Ra4# is mate! ) ( 40.Kb4 Rxc4+! (Black doesn't have time to waste by retreating the rook) 41.Kxc4 g2 42.b6 a6! 43.Ra7 Rb1 44.Rxa6 Ke7! ( 44...Kg5?? 45.b7 Rxb7 46.Bxe5 and the trouble is 46...g1=Q?? walks into mate after 47.Bf4+ Kh4 48.Rh6# ) 45.Bb4+ Rxb4+ 46.Kxb4 g1=Q and Black wins, since 47.b7?? is met with 47...Qb1+ . )

**38.Bxb5 Rxc5**

The rattling protuberances on b5 and c5 finally fall.

**39.Bf1**

Black did manage to wipe out White's monster pawn majority. However White's pair of bishops offers him excellent chances to hold the game.

**39...Rh1 40.Be2?**

The bishop wearies of his guard duties and decides to take a coffee break at Starbucks. This is a mistake, after which White scatters his final hopes to the wind. White's counterplay turns out to be a mental fabrication with no inherent reality of its own.

He voluntarily breaks his own blockade when he has chances to hold the draw with 40.a6! bxa6 41.Bb4 Rc6 42.c4 f4 43.exf4 exf4 44.Bc3+ Kg5 45.Rd5+ Kh6 46.Bd3 f3 47.Rd7 Rd1 48.Be5! (threat: Bf4+, forcing mate) 48...Rxd3+ 49.Rxd3 f2 50.Rd1 Re6 51.Bc3 and winning this one won't be so easy for Black.

**40...Rxd1 41.Bxd1 Kg5 42.Be2 f4**

White has no defence to Black's rolling kingside pawn majority.

**43.a6 bxa6 44.Bb4 Rc7 45.exf4+ exf4 46.c4**

White's c-pawn is way too slow.

**46...f3! 47.Bf1**

47.gxf3 g2 48.Bd2+ Kh4 49.Be3 Re7 wins.

**47...Kf5**

There is more danger in the king's eyes, than in the swords of the guards who accompany him.

**48.c5**

48.Bd3+ Ke6 49.Bf1 Rh7 and there is no defence to the coming ...Rh1.

**48...a5 49.Ba3**

The sound of scrambling feet over loose stones indicates the breakup of White's retreating defenders.

**49...Ke4**

. Manna comes tumbling down from the heavens to Black's land of plenty as he follows up with ...Ke3 and ...Kf2. --- SUMMARY: I don't think Black fully equalized after 7...Kf8. It may be better to play the 7...g6 version on the 6 Bc1 line.

0-1

### (74)8: McCutcheon Deviations   --   ? ? ????   \* (Cyrus Lakdawala)

FEN: rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3q2B1/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 1

In this chapter, White's sense of practicality outruns desire. When an opponent sidesteps a much desired theoretical fight, our feeling is similar to traveling to a conference at great expense, hoping to hear the speaker expound and dispense life-changing wisdom, but instead, he only wants to discuss the weather. FIDE should create some kind of a regulatory commission which levies stiff penalties on those who maliciously ruin our French joy by dodging theoretical lines (the last refuge of the unbooked opponent), entering variants of the Exchange French. In this chapter, we look for ways to lend dynamism to otherwise drab proceedings, to try and make a fight of it, even when White desires the exact opposite. In the above diagram, we cross White's intent with the dynamic 5...Qxd5, which leads to strange hybrid positions of Scandinavian and Burn French.

We also look at oddball/surprise attempts by White to dodge sharp theoretical lines. --- In most of these cases, White may be fooling himself or herself, believing a contaminated thing to be pure. Rest assured that White is lucky to equalize in most of the theoretical dodges.

### (75)Kovalevskaya, E.   --   Volkov, S. 53: Russian League, Togliatti  2003   0-1   C12 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.exd5**

The dynamic Lasker Variation against the McCutcheon is the line I advocated for White in A Ferocious Opening Repertoire. Some consider this variation a kind of antiquarian curiosity. But remember this - That which is old and forgotten, is once again new. --- QUESTION: Wait a minute! In the game introduction, you threw a fit about the Exchange variations, stating that "FIDE should create some kind of a regulatory commission which levies stiff penalties on those who maliciously ruin our French joy by dodging theoretical lines". Now, miraculously, since you advocated the line in your Veresov repertoire book, why is the line suddenly "dynamic"? --- ANSWER: Yes, I stand by my "dynamic" description of the line. This one really isn't boring and offers both sides chances. In general, White tries to remove the dynamism from the lines with the Exchange variations but just take a look at the game continuation. Players can come to opposite conclusions of the same position, depending on how one perceives the position. White might consider his opening mission accomplished in having reached a non-theoretical and relatively less tense position while Black succeeds in gaining a position sufficiently complex enough to play for the win.

**5...Qxd5!**

Our strongest response is to go for an odd Scandinavian, where we get dynamically even chances.

We will cover 5...exd5 6.Qf3! in the notes to the last game of the chapter and book.

**6.Bxf6**

QUESTION: Why did White give away the bishop pair when she can develop and cover the g5-bishop with 6.Nf3 ? --- ANSWER: For the same reason White chops on f6 in the Burn Variation - to create an imbalance. White is willing to hand over the bishop pair to disrupt Black's structure and make kingside castling more difficult. --- After 6...Ne4 7.Bd2 Bxc3 8.bxc3 : ( 8...b6 9.c4 Qd6 10.Be2 c5 11.Be3 ( 11.c3 Bb7 has the feel of a sour Nimzo-Indian for White ) 11...Bb7 12.dxc5 Qxd1+ 13.Rxd1 Nxc5 14.Nd4 Nbd7 15.f3 Ke7 , E.Schmittdiel-I.Glek, Bussum 1995. --- It feels like Black's structural advantages outweigh White's bishop pair and piece play. ) ( 8...c5 9.Bd3! ( 9.c4 Qd8 10.c3 Nc6 and Black stands at least equal ) 9...c4 10.Bxe4 Qxe4+ 11.Qe2 , H.Van Riemsdijk-M.Hovhanisian, Brasschaat 2012, I like Black's chances in the ending after 11...Qxe2+ 12.Kxe2 b6 . )

**6...Bxc3+**

QUESTION: Why does Black take on c3 without provocation?

ANSWER: Black dents White's queenside pawns immediately as by playing 6...gxf6 instead, White has options like options like: ( 7.Ne2 Nc6 8.a3 Bxc3+ 9.Nxc3! Qxd4 10.Qxd4 Nxd4 11.O-O-O c5 12.Ne4 b6 13.c3 Nb3+ 14.Kc2 Na5 15.b4 Nb7 16.Nxf6+ Ke7 17.Ne4 and White regained the sac'ed pawn but didn't secure an advantage, A.Morozevich-A.Kovalev, Moscow 1994. ) ( 7.Qd2 Qa5 , S.Kindermann-M.Gurevich, Budapest 1987, when White gets a nice looking Burn-style position after 8.Nge2 Nc6 9.O-O-O Bd7 10.a3 . ( ) )

**7.bxc3 gxf6 8.Qd2**

8.Nf3 is also met with 8...Qa5! 9.Qd2 b6 10.Be2 Bb7 11.O-O Rg8 12.Rfb1 Rb5 is in the air. 12...Qf5 13.Rb5 Qh3 14.g3 a6 15.Rb3 Nd7 16.c4 O-O-O and Black's attack looks slightly more promising than White's, J.De la Villa Garcia-I.Glek, Saint Vincent 1999.

**8...Qa5!**

Our queen behaves like one of those automated polite women, who possess excellent manners but little warmth. --- QUESTION: Why did Black move his queen when it was not attacked? Wouldn't he be better off developing a piece? --- ANSWER: GM Neil McDonald answers your question "Black moves his queen a second time for the simple reason that it is the best move. It anticipates the attack c3-c4 which would now allow the exchange of queens. This is something which isn't part of White's strategy as in the endgame it would be much easier for Black to undermine the doubled pawns on the c-file with c7-c5, etc. than for White to get any play against the f-pawns."

**9.Ne2**

9.Bd3 Bd7! ( Black played the correct move order as 9...b6?! is met with 10.Be4 ) 10.Ne2 Bc6 11.Nf4 ( 11.f3 Nd7 12.O-O O-O-O 13.Nc1! (White intends to eject the annoying intruder on a5, with Nb3) 13...Rdg8 14.Nb3 Qg5 15.Qe2 Nf8! (Black loads up on the kingside for an attack) 16.Be4 Bb5 17.Bd3 , J.Magem Badals-I.Glek, Cap d`Agde 1996. Now Black took a repetition draw by shuffling his bishop from c6 to b5, which I think was too modest a goal on his part. He should go for the full point with 17...Bxd3! 18.cxd3 Ng6 with the idea of ...Nf4, ...h5 to initiate a promising attack ) 11...Nd7 12.c4 Qxd2+ 13.Kxd2 , N.Ninov-S.Volkov, Fagernes 2013. Black stands at least even in the ending after 13...Nb6 14.f3 O-O-O .

9.Nf3 b6 10.Be2 Bb7 transposes to the De la Villa Garcia-Glek note from above.

**9...b6**

Black prepares to aim his bishop at g2 as well as the key central light squares on d5 and e4.

**10.Qf4!?**

A double attack on the f6- and c7-pawns, which isn't as strong as it seems, since White falls too far behind in development if he indulges in pawn-grabbing.

Perhaps White should continue with the thematic manoeuvre 10.Nc1 Bb7 11.Nb3 Qd5 ( more ambitious than 11...Qg5!? , D.Marshall-H.Groffen, correspondence 2004 ) 12.f3 ( 12.c4 is met with the annoying 12...Qe4+ ) 12...Nd7 13.Bd3 Qh5 14.O-O f5 15.a4 Rg8 and I like Black's attacking chances, J.Magem Badals-N.Legky, France 1998.

**10...Nd7 11.Qf3!?**

The greatest humiliation for a would-be thief is to leave a heist empty-handed.

White changes her mind as after 11.Qxc7!? Ba6 , the position looks quite awful for White, yet Houdini forced a draw after 12.Rd1 Rc8 ( 12...Ke7 13.d5 Rac8 14.d6+ Kf8 15.Qxd7 Rxc3 16.Qe7+ Kg7 17.Nxc3 Qxc3+ 18.Rd2 Qa1+ 19.Rd1 Qc3+ is perpetual check ) 13.Qxa7 Rxc3 14.Nxc3 Qxc3+ and once again, perpetual check occurs.

**11...Rb8 12.Nf4 e5!?**

A risky move,

though 12...Bb7 13.Qe3 Kf8 14.Bc4 e5 15.Nh5 Bxg2 16.Rg1 exd4 17.Qh6+ Ke8 18.O-O-O Qxc3 19.Rxg2 Qa1+ 20.Kd2 Qc3+ 21.Kc1 Qa1+ is yet another perpetual check variation.

**13.dxe5**

13.Nd5 exd4 14.Qe4+ Kf8 15.Qxd4 Bb7 16.Nxc7 Qe5+ 17.Qxe5 fxe5 18.O-O-O Nc5 offers Black full compensation for the pawn.

**13...fxe5!?**

A confident move. Usually, in such an open position, time takes precedence over structure.

Black can also opt for 13...Nxe5! 14.Qe3 O-O with at least even chances.

**14.Nh5**

14.Nd5 Bb7 15.O-O-O! Qa3+ 16.Kb1 Qc5 17.Be2 Rg8 18.Rd2 Rg6 19.Rhd1 Rd6 20.c4 Kf8 is dead even, according to Houdini.

**14...Bb7 15.Qg3 Qd5 16.Qg7 Ke7!**

Black's king darkly views the approaching knight with an offended eye. He loves his odious g7-sister but wisely remains upwind of her, no matter which way she turns. --- EXERCISE (critical decision/planning): Volkov understands that White's attack isn't so dangerous since only the queen and the knight participate. Black connects rooks and threatens disruptions like ...Qe4+ and ...Rhg8. From the human eye, it appears that White is in trouble since she experiences difficulty unravelling the kingside pieces. Clearly, White's position contains many thorns and very few petals. However, Houdini assesses this position at dead even, conditional upon finding the correct path. White has a choice of two tempting moves, 17 Rd1, hitting Black's queen with tempo, or 17 Qg5+. One forces a draw, while the other loses the initiative. The correct plan for now is only in the abstract, the way a scuba diver sees only unrecognizable human shapes on the boat above. Which move would you play?

**17.Qg5+?**

"We all talk nonsense when the dream's upon us," mused the old hag in the BBC TV adaptation of Dicken's The Mystery of Edwin Drood. This move misses the essence. Now Black stands better, since he can force queens off the board, leaving him with the superior structure and sagging development.

ANSWER: White draws with 17.Rd1! Qe4+ 18.Be2 Qg6 ( 18...Qxg2 19.Rxd7+! Kxd7 20.Qxf7+ Kd8 21.Qf6+ Kd7 22.Qf7+ is drawn in an endlessly replicating model ) 19.Bg4! and Black has nothing better than to repeat with 19...Qe4+ ( since 19...Nf6?? loses to 20.Qxf6+ Qxf6 21.Rd7+ . )

**17...f6 18.Qg7+**

18.Qe3 Qe4! removes queens from the board, after which White suffers from an inferior pawn structure and a developmental lag.

**18...Qf7**

"Oh! Fancy meeting you here!" says Black's queen, who clearly engineered the entire coincidence.

**19.O-O-O Qxg7 20.Nxg7 Rhd8!**

20...Rhg8?! allows White back into the game after 21.Nf5+ Ke8 22.Bb5 Rd8 23.Ne3 .

**21.f3 Nc5**

The weakness of the doubled c-pawns means that White is very awkwardly placed.

**22.Bd3**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Wishes and daydreams must yield to data and hard facts. White's last move drops a pawn by force. How? --- ANSWER: Now that Black's knight finally received an audience from White's king, he discovers that he has a lot to say.

**22...Na4!**

White defensive issues sprout tendrils of anxiety which entwine the c3-pawn.

**23.Rde1**

Other tries fail to save the pawn. For example: 23.Kd2 Kf7 24.Nf5 Nb2 25.Rb1 Nxd3 26.cxd3 Ba6 (the evil bishop isn't as God-fearing as he led everyone to believe) 27.d4 exd4 28.cxd4 Bc8 29.Ng3 Rxd4+ .

23.c4 Nc3 24.Rde1 Nxa2+ 25.Kb2 Nb4 and the trouble is, after 26.Bxh7?? , the wizard recites an incantation but nothing happens as White hangs material to 26...Kf7! and no matter how she plays, White drops a piece.

**23...Nxc3 24.a3**

Once again, 24.Bxh7?? fails miserably to 24...Kf7! 25.Nh5 ( 25.Nf5 Rh8 makes no difference ) 25...Rh8 winning a piece.

**24...b5**

The h7-pawn is still untouchable.

**25.Nf5+ Kf8 26.Ng3 h6**

. White, down a clean pawn and outrated by almost 200 rating points, decides to conserve energy by resigning here - perhaps a tad too early. --- SUMMARY: The Lasker Variation, 5 exd5 Qxd5! is the exception to the rule and is a sharp position, despite that fact that it is a variant of the Exchange French.

0-1

### (76)Willemze, T.   --   Nepomniachtchi, I. 54: Corus Group C, Wijk aan Zee  2007   0-1   C12 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6**

There's also 3...Bb4 . --- QUESTION: Hold it. ..you seem a little confused today. Why discuss a Winawer line in a book on Classical French? --- ANSWER: Please continue with the analysis! After 4.Ne2 Nf6 5.Bg5 , we directly transpose to our Classical position from a Winawer move order!

**4.Bg5 Bb4 5.Ne2**

In a way, this is quite a time-efficient variation, since White only needs one line versus both Winawer and Classical McCutcheon French - quite a neat trick!

**5...dxe4**

QUESTION: Why did we just hand White the better centre? --- ANSWER: This is Black's best move. This little Burn Variation-like trick allows Black to equalize comfortably, since White must waste energy winning back the lost pawn.

I don't care for Black's sterile position after 5...h6 6.Bxf6 Qxf6 7.a3 Bxc3+ 8.Nxc3 , D.Campora-J.Galiana Salom, Oropesa del Mar 1996.

**6.a3 Be7**

QUESTION: This move looks passive. Why not just save a tempo by chopping on c3? --- ANSWER: Trading on c3 is inferior for the following reasons: 1. Black gives away the bishop pair without a trace of compensation. --- 2. By trading on c3, Black actually gives White a helping hand by unraveling the e2-knight which blocked White's kingside development. --- 3. By playing our bishop back to e7, we break White's annoying f6-pin.

Conversely, after 6...Bxc3+?! 7.Nxc3 h6 8.Bh4! Nc6 9.Bb5 Bd7 10.O-O a6 11.Bc4 g5 12.Bg3 Ne7 13.f3! e3 (Black has no choice but to decline) 14.Ne4 Ng6 15.Re1 , White regains his pawn with the bishop pair and a clear strategic advantage, V.Ivanchuk-E.Forsaa, Caleta 2013.

**7.Bxf6 gxf6!**

Let's remain in familiar Burn-like waters with the more dynamic recapture with the g-pawn.

The less ambitious 7...Bxf6 is also playable and after 8.Nxe4 Bd7 9.g3 Bc6 10.Bg2 Bxe4 11.Bxe4 c6 12.c3 Nd7 13.Qc2 , V.Ivanchuk-S.Volkov, Moscow 2005, I don't believe White's extra space means much here after 13...g6 . To a Scandinavian/Caro-Kann player like me, Black's position looks just fine.

**8.Nxe4 b6**

Just like in the Burn, here we have the choice of fianchettoing first, or kicking White's knight away with: 8...f5 which does weaken the e5-square. After 9.N4c3 c6 (in order to halt d5 ideas) 10.g3 b6 11.Bg2 Bb7 12.Nf4 Nd7 13.O-O Nf6 14.Re1 Qd6 15.Qe2 O-O-O 16.Rad1 Rhe8 17.Na2! (bizarre, yet potent! White plans to manoeuvre his knight to e5) 17...Qc7 18.Nb4 Bd6 19.Nbd3 Kb8 20.c4 Bf8 21.Ne5 , Black's position looks passive as White owns more space and also the superior attacking chances, D.Campora-A.Jerez Perez, Granada 2006.

QUESTION: Why did Black play ...b6 when in the Burn, Black almost always play ...a6 and ...b5? --- ANSWER: I'm assuming ...a6 and ...b5 are too slow here, since I see just a single game in the database with the Morozevich/Burn plan with: 8...a6 9.Qd3 b5 10.O-O-O Bb7 , S.Chernikova-V.Kiselev, Odessa 2007. At this stage, White can exploit her developmental lead with the tricky 11.Qf3! Nc6 12.Qf4 which looks scary for Black, who must watch out for Nc5, d5 and even future Qh6 ideas. At this point, if Black gets tricky with 12...f5?? intending ...Bg5 tricks, White has 13.d5! with a winning position.

**9.Qd2**

White logically prepares to castle queenside.

9.N2c3 is White's main move. Following 9...Bb7 10.Qf3 (we must be on guard against this dirty trick) 10...c6! (don't worry, one day we will get a chance to play ...c5) 11.O-O-O f5 ( 11...Nd7 12.Qg3 f5 transposes to the following note ) 12.Ng3 Nd7 13.Nh5 Nf6 14.Bc4 Qc7 15.Nxf6+ Bxf6 16.g4 O-O-O 17.gxf5 Bxd4 18.fxe6 fxe6 19.Bxe6+ Kb8 , Black's monster dark-squared bishop easily compensates for the missing pawn. After 20.Qg3 Be5 21.Rxd8+ Rxd8 22.Qh3 c5 23.Re1 Bxh2 , Black regained the sac'ed pawn with the slightly superior chances, A.Tobak-V.Malakhatko, Polanica Zdroj 1999.

9.Qd3 Bb7 10.O-O-O Nd7 11.N2c3 c6 12.Qg3 f5 13.Nd6+ Bxd6 14.Qxd6 , F.Sabirov-A.Rustamov,A Tashkent 2007 and Black can equalize with 14...Qb8! .

**9...Bb7 10.N4c3 c6!**

A necessary evil. Black must suppress d5, relying on his bishop pair, dark-square potential and compact centre as future dividends for investing in his currently passive state.

**11.g3**

This is a new move.

Following 11.O-O-O Nd7 12.Rg1 Qc7 13.g3 O-O-O 14.Bg2 f5 15.Kb1 Nf6 16.h3 Kb8 17.Qe3 h5! , Black looks slightly better to me with ...h4 coming, C.Comte-X.Garbarino, France 1996.

**11...Nd7 12.Bg2 Qc7 13.Qh6!?**

The queen fishes around for targets where there really isn't one.

After 13.O-O-O , Chesspublishing.com's French guru GM Neil McDonald suggests 13...b5!? , intending to attack with ...Nb6 and ...a5 next.

**13...O-O-O 14.Qh5 Rdf8 15.O-O?!**

Freedom to choose doesn't mean freedom from consequences. Ambition is an unceasing itch, worse than any case of eczema. To discover a position's truth, it's crucial to first frame the correct questions which require answers. In this case, when considering opposite wing castling, the very first question you ask yourself is: Which side is faster? In this case, Black looks faster. White bravely but unwisely voluntarily disembarks from the safety of same side castling, chancing the unknown by crossing into opposite wings castling. He tries to make a statement in refusing to quail beneath the intimidation of facing a much higher-rated opponent, but this is an overreaction.

**15...f5**

Clearing the path for ...Nf6 and ...h5, after which Black's attack rolls.

**16.Nf4 Nf6 17.Qf3**

The fourth move for the queen, which is a clear indication of tempi loss.

**17...Rd8 18.Rad1 h5 19.b4!?**

This allows Black a free hand to attack, while White's hasn't even begun.

White refuses to take his cue and play 19.h4 which admittedly weakens squares but is superior to the way White went in the game.

**19...Bd6**

Threatening serious damage to White's structure.

I prefer the immediate 19...h4 .

**20.Nd3**

20.Nce2! at least clears the way for c4 and c5.

**20...h4 21.b5?**

EXERCISE (planning): The last move declares "Forget it. I'm going for it!" and White, desperate for counterplay, isn't exactly playing the position with a delicate touch. With the last move, he allows Black a strong strategic idea. Come up with a plan for Black to exploit it. --- ANSWER:

**21...Nd5!**

This interference trick forces White's next move.

**22.Nxd5**

The knight, cloaked in shame, has no choice but to concede the skirmish and give in to his d5-counterpart's demands.

White won't survive anyway after 22.bxc6 (played with the philosophy: It's better to remain free and live in a hovel, rather than be a slave who lives in a palace) 22...Bxc6 23.Nxd5 Bxd5 24.Qe2 Bxg2 25.Kxg2 Qc6+ 26.f3 hxg3 27.hxg3 Rdg8 28.Ne5 Bxe5 29.dxe5 f4 when Black's attack - a horse and carriage careening down a hill, with White's king as the sole passenger - is out of control. The trouble isThe trouble is 30.g4 walks into the crushing 30...Rxg4+ .

**22...cxd5**

White's attack just went dead and Black also created multiple weaknesses in White's camp down the c-file.

**23.Qe3 hxg3 24.hxg3 Kb8 25.a4 Rc8 26.Ra1**

EXERCISE (planning): White's defensive burden continues to increase in synch with the exhaustion of his resources. One of the most common psychological errors we all commit from time to time in winning positions, is the false assumption that inertia is sufficient to take home the point. Work out Black's strongest plan here. --- ANSWER: Pile up on the d4-pawn.

**26...Qc3!**

Threat: ...Rc4.

The greedy 26...Qxc2? allows White's counterplay to flare up after 27.Rfc1 Qb3 28.Rcb1 Qc3 29.Rc1 Qa5 30.Ne5 .

**27.a5 Rc4 28.a6**

Do you get the feeling that in White's plan, there are too many middlemen leeching away profits? The a-pawn's push (which closes lines) is strategic suicide and is akin to giving aid and comfort to the enemy.

Yet opening the a-file does little as 28.axb6 axb6 29.Ne5 Qxe3 30.fxe3 Bxe5 31.dxe5 Rg8 is a hopeless ending for White.

**28...Bc8 29.Rfd1 Qxd4**

There goes a very important pawn. The queen continues to impose upon White's involuntary hospitality. It's always annoying to encounter a self-absorbed person, like Black's queen, who believes the solar system revolves around her. Even more infuriating is the fact that she may be correct in her assumption.

**30.Qe2**

EXERCISE (combination alert): The fact that access to a simple combination is the natural corollary of White's previously reckless play. Since coaxing didn't work, it's time to turn it up a notch and force White's resignation. White just blundered in a hopeless position. Black to play and win more material. --- ANSWER: Pin. White has no good discoveries with his knight.

**30...Bxg3**

. The dark-squared leviathan, seeking to extend his reach, draws near the white king on the pretext of asking about his health - a question to which he already knows the answer.

Following 30...Bxg3 31.Nb4 Qxf2+ 32.Qxf2 Bxf2+ 33.Kxf2 Rxb4 , Black is clearly winning with three extra pawns. --- SUMMARY: When White plays the ambidextrous Winawer/Classical line 5 Nge2, meet it with the Burn-like 5...dxe4 6 a3 Be7 when Black achieves easy equality. There's one alteration to remember though. In this one, we play ...b6, unlike ...a6 and ...b5, as in the Burn.

0-1

### (77)Arutyunov, N.   --   Lakdawala, C. 55: Gambito Open (rapid), San Diego  2013   0-1   C00 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.e5 h6 6.exf6**

White once again departs from the traditional formula.

In the next game, we will look at 6.Bh4 .

**6...hxg5 7.fxg7 Rg8 8.Qh5**

QUESTION: Should Black be concerned, since White essentially destroyed our kingside castling options? Also, Black may fall behind in development since it takes time to win back the g7-pawn. --- ANSWER: Black stands no worse in this position and may even be a shade better. We are a tad behind in development yet White has no quick method of opening up the position. So our bishop pair, control over the dark squares and superior centre probably mean more than White's fleeting developmental lead.

White can attempt to utilize his slim developmental lead by opening up the kingside while Black's queenside remains undeveloped with 8.h4 gxh4 : ( 9.Nf3 Qf6 10.Qd3 Bd7 11.a3 Be7 12.Nb5 Na6 13.Qb3 Qf4 , R.Zelcic-B.Socko, Dresden 2007. Black stands slightly better after 14.g3 Qe4+ 15.Be2 O-O-O 16.gxh4 Bxb5 17.Qxb5 Rxg7 . ) ( 9.Qg4 Qf6 10.Rxh4 Rxg7 11.Rh8+ Ke7 12.Qh3 Nc6 13.O-O-O Bxc3 14.Qxc3 ( Black looks slightly better after 14.bxc3 Qxf2 15.Nf3 Qg3 16.Qh6 Rb8 when I have doubts about White's full compensation for the pawn ) 14...Rxg2! (discovered attack) 15.Bxg2 ( or 15.Rxc8 Rxc8 16.Bxg2 Qg5+ 17.Qe3 Qxg2 18.Nf3 Qg4 when White lacks compensation for the pawn ) 15...Qxh8 and White has some but not complete compensation for the missing pawn. )

8.a3 (this move gives away White's developmental lead) 8...Be7!? . I wanted to hang on to the dark-squared bishop, ( also fine for Black is 8...Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 Qf6 10.Nf3 Qxg7 11.Rb1 Nd7 12.h4 gxh4 13.Rxh4 b6 as Black soon completes development and retains the slightly superior structure ) 9.Qh5 Bf6 10.h4 gxh4 ( I didn't trust the complications of 10...Bxd4 11.hxg5 Bxg7 which Houdini rates at dead even ) 11.Nf3 Rxg7 12.Rxh4! , R.Hamad-C.Lakdawala, San Diego (rapid) 2013, the game looks balanced, especially after 12...Nd7 13.Rh3 Nf8 14.Ne5 Ng6 .

**8...Qf6 9.Ne2**

I find it ironic that my friend Antonio, who nicknamed your not-so-brave writer "El pollo Viejo" (which means "the old chicken") plays such a draw-grovelling chickenish move like 9.Qh7 himself. After 9...Qxg7 10.Qxg7 Rxg7 (an ending favours Black in this line, since he owns the bishop pair and also superior central influence) 11.Bd3 ( 11.h4 looks better ) 11...Nc6 12.Ne2 Bd7 13.O-O-O O-O-O 14.Bb5 Rh8 15.h3 a6 16.Bxc6 Bxc6 17.a3 Bd6 , Black stood clearly better in the ending with the bishop pair, superior central influence and some kingside file pressure as well, A.Gonzalez-C.Lakdawala, San Diego (rapid) 2013.

9.Nf3 Qxg7 10.a3 was W.De Weerd-I.Glek, Korinthos 2000. Black stands clearly better after 10...Bd6 11.h4 g4 12.Ng5 Nc6 13.Bb5 g3 .

**9...Qxg7 10.O-O-O Nc6**

A new move. Generally, Black prevents Nb5, but I didn't really fear it. --- QUESTION: Shouldn't Black be playing for ...c5? --- ANSWER: I would avoid it when behind in development.

All Black needs to do (to stand slightly better) is to catch up in development: 10...c5!? has never been played and violates the principle: Don't open the game when lagging in development. After 11.Nb5 Na6 12.c3 Ba5 13.dxc5 , Houdini rates this position at close to even. To my human eye, White looks better with the developmental lead.

10...a6 11.h4 Rh8 12.Qg4 f5 13.Qg3 Bd6 14.f4 g4 15.Qe3 Qe7 16.g3 Nd7 17.Nb1 Nf6 and Black stands better since his knight reaches e4 before White's reaches e5, E.Mihov-N.Kostov Sofia 2009.

10...Bd7 11.h4 Rh8 12.Qg4 Qh6 was M.Gionfriddo-R.Junge, correspondence 1997. Black's game looks promising with the bishop pair and dark-square influence after 13.h5 Nc6 14.f4 Be7 .

**11.Nb5**

So what? My bishop is happy to oblige and protect c7.

**11...Ba5 12.Qf3 a6 13.Na3!?**

QUESTION: Why did White park his knight to the side? --- ANSWER: He intends to recentralize it with something like c3, Nc2 and Ne3, but of course, this takes a lot of time.

13.Nbc3 was better. Even here Black looks like he holds a solid edge.

**13...Bd7**

I thought about 13...Bb4!? to bring my dark-squared bishop into play but then decided it can emerge on c7.

**14.c3 O-O-O 15.Ng3?!**

EXERCISE (planning): White tries this and tries that, like some actor testing out various facial expressions to emotions, to an ambiguous set of lines in the script. Black has the bishop pair and also greater central influence. Come up with a plan to seize a clear advantage.

15.Nc2 Rh8 was the lesser evil.

**15...e5!**

ANSWER: Play the thematic freeing central break, after which Black's piece activity grows exponentially. --- Principles: Open the game when you have the bishop pair and lead in development. Yes, Black who now leads in development and also, the d5-pawn doesn't really hang.

**16.Nc2**

The central trade 16.dxe5 Nxe5 doesn't promise much after 17.Qe2 ( 17.Qxd5?? loses on the spot to 17...Ba4 ) 17...c6 18.Nc2 Rde8 19.Kb1 Ng4 20.Qd2 Bb6 21.Nd4 Qf6 22.f3 Ne3 23.Re1 Qf4 and Black completely dominates the central dark squares.

**16...e4**

Houdini prefers 16...Bb6! retaining the central tension for a while.

**17.Qe3 f5 18.f4**

Not much choice.

**18...exf3?!**

The wrong plan, after which Black's advantage diminishes.

Correct was 18...gxf4! 19.Qxf4 Ne7 20.Ne2 c6! (the goal is to seize control over the f4-square) 21.g3 Bc7 22.Qd2 Ng6 23.Kb1 f4 24.gxf4 Rdf8 25.Rg1 Qf7 and Black regains the sacrificed pawn with a huge strategic advantage.

**19.Qxf3 f4?!**

Houdini calls for 19...Rgf8! 20.Qxd5 f4 21.Ne4 Qg6 22.Nf2 Bg4 23.Bd3 ( 23.Qe4? and White's position spins out of control after 23...Bf5 24.Qe2 Rfe8 25.Qd2 Nxd4! ) 23...Qh5 24.Qc4 Bxd1 25.Nxd1 and White's pawn isn't quite enough for the exchange.

**20.Nh5!**

I underestimated this move. It isn't so easy to eject the annoying intruder.

**20...Qf7 21.g4**

This is the trouble. White backs up the annoying h5-knight.

**21...Ne7 22.Bd3?!**

Too slow.

White should seize the chance to break up Black's kingside pawns with 22.h4! .

**22...Ng6 23.h3 Nh4 24.Qf2 c6**

The bishop tires of the gulag and desires to re-enter society via c7.

**25.Rde1 Bc7 26.b3**

This looks like a bluff. I knew White wasn't going to toss in c4 when Black owned the nasty bishop pair, who lay in wait for the game to open.

**26...Rh8**

QUESTION: What is the point of this move? --- ANSWER: Black considers an exchange sac for a pawn on h5. If I can also pick up the h3-pawn, then Black's kingside passers will force their way down the board.

**27.Kb2**

White can remove his knight from harm's way with 27.Ng3 Rdf8 28.Nf1 f3 29.Nfe3 Qf4 but Black hangs on to a powerful initiative just the same.

**27...Rdf8 28.Re2 Rxh5!?**

It was either the exchange sac or go for 28...f3!? which also looked quite promising.

**29.gxh5 Qxh5 30.Ne1 Nf5 31.Rg1 Rh8 ?!**

In time pressure, evil imps tend to dance and pirouette about in my head, suggesting various tempting yet stupid courses of action. My clock was running low and I banged out this waste-of-time move.

Better was the immediate 31...Rg8 .

**32.Bxf5?!**

This move merely has the effect of ripening White's growing frustration. Now Black's bishops get quite dangerous and it becomes next to impossible to defend the h3-pawn forever.

White may have forced a repetition draw after 32.Nf3! Ng3 33.Re7 Bd8 34.Rg7! . This looks dangerous yet Black has no way to exploit the rook's taunting after 34...Bf6 35.Rg6 Be7 36.Rg7 .

**32...Bxf5 33.Nf3 Rg8 34.Ne5**

34.Re7 Bd8 35.Ree1 Bxh3 also drops the h-pawn.

**34...Qxh3 35.Qxf4?**

The demonstration spews noise but no real danger to Black's king. This looks like another one of the queen's calculated mood swings. "I have transcended beyond misfortune's reach," declares White's queen, who soon realizes the embarrassing necessity to revise her prediction. When opportunism grapples with caution, the former tends to be the muscular favourite, against the flabby, sedentary latter. Added to that, time trouble, which brings out our true nature, has a way of turning a feast of reason into slapstick comedy. There is no hope of reforming natural attackers, who are enticed by both sound and unsound versions, at a 100% recidivism rate. Unfortunately, there are many shady members of the San Diego chess community who attempt to con your gullible writer, especially when his clock runs low. This desperado loses, since White obsesses about Black's king, to the exclusion of his own.

White had to try his luck with 35.Qg2 Qxg2 36.Rexg2 g4! 37.Rxg4! ( 37.Nxg4?? hangs a piece to 37...f3 ) 37...Bxg4 38.Rxg4 Rxg4 39.Nxg4 f3 40.Kc2 Kd7 41.Kd2 Bf4+ 42.Ke1 Ke6 43.Kf2 Bd2 44.Kxf3 Bxc3 45.Ke3 with reasonable drawing chances, since all the pawns are on the same side of the board. In the aftermath, White's position is like that of a beautiful woman who fights smallpox and survives, but at the heavy cost of a pox-scarred face for life.

**35...gxf4 36.Rxg8+ Bd8 37.Nf7**

EXERCISE (critical decision): Find one accurate move and White will harbour deep misgivings about his queen sac, since his would-be attack/initiative gets shuts down. What would you play here? --- ANSWER: Interference. It's critical to keep the e2-rook out of the attack.

**37...Be4!**

The e2-rook watches in irritation as Black's interfering bishop undoes his glorious future.

I was very low on time and briefly considered the suicidal, not to mention moronic 37...f3?? when 38.Rxd8+! Kc7 39.Re7+ Kb6 40.Nd6 allows White's pieces to command a clear view of Black's deeply troubled king.

**38.Rxd8+ Kc7 39.Rh8 Qf1**

The queen's actions steal imperceptibly into the concerns of the white defenders.

**40.Rhh2 f3 41.Ref2 Qb1+ 42.Ka3**

White's king, long a master of charming the ladies, hasn't made much headway breaking the ice with Black's queen.

**42...Qc1+**

The mad queen has this quirk of delivering Shakespearian asides to an imaginary audience, while she is in a conversation with a real person. Now White's vulnerable king reminds the black attackers of a doormat with the word "Welcome!" boldly emblazoned on it.

**43.Rb2**

Flummoxed defenders slip on multiple banana peels, crashing into one another, leaping clumsily to their king's aid.

However, after 43.Kb4? , Black forces mate in three with 43...a5+ 44.Ka4 (the king continues to dance his involuntary fandango up the board) 44...b5+ 45.Kxa5 . The king's lame claim that he was simply walking in his sleep, is regarded with cold suspicion by Black's queen, who strongly suspects he is attempting to slip away from her company and with 45...Qa3# , a more sensitive man than White's king would take offence at the queen's leer.

**43...Qxc3**

Threatening mate on a5. The c3-pawn is merely the condiment and Black's queen looks forward to the full meal: White's king.

**44.Rbd2 a5!**

. Another attacker is added to the mix, after which White collapses.

After 44...a5! 45.Ne5 Qb4+ 46.Kb2 , the king's eyes grow wide as gold doubloons, at the coming attack and following 46...a4 , there is no good defence to the coming ...a3+. --- SUMMARY: Black gets equality and maybe a little more after the theoretical dodge 6 exf6.

0-1

### (78)Gutsko, N.   --   Kiselev, V. 56: Lugansk Stanitsa, Ukraine  2010   0-1   C12 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4 5.e5 h6 6.Bh4**

We continue the parade of theoretical evasion! We shouldn't underestimate this one. IM John Watson writes: "6 Bh4 is considerably better than the books generally indicate. " --- QUESTION: Does Watson imply that White can actually extract an edge from the line? --- ANSWER: No. Looking at his analysis, he suggests that Black has no better than equality against it. Looking at the stats, White scores 54.6% in the line, which is a fraction short of the statistical average of 55% for White. If this is the case, equality with Black isn't the end of the world!

**6...g5**

Only moves can still be good ones.

**7.Bg3 Ne4 8.Ne2**

QUESTION: In the 6 Be3 and 6 Bc1 lines we looked in Chapter 7, White often sacs a pawn with a3. Can he play 8 a3 here with the same idea?

ANSWER: There are zero such games found in the database. It also doesn't sound like a good idea to me as after 8.a3 , Black can grab the pawn with 8...Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 Nxc3 10.Qf3 Ne4 11.Bd3 and eliminate White's dark-squared bishop with ...Nxg3, which admittedly does offer White some play for the pawn. More importantly, Black has a superior plan of returning the pawn back to seize the initiative with 11...c5! 12.Bxe4 (there is nothing better) 12...dxe4 13.Qxe4 Bd7! when it soon becomes clear that Black's control over the light squares outweighs White's control over the dark ones. Following 14.f3 Qa5+ 15.Kf2 Bb5! (White must watch out for ...Qd2+) 16.Rd1 Nc6 17.dxc5 Qxa3 18.Qe3 Qxe3+ 19.Kxe3 Nb4 , Black has a clear structural superiority in the ending.

**8...c5**

Black's overwhelming choice.

Also playable is 8...f5 9.f3 Nxc3 10.Nxc3 c5 11.a3 Bxc3+ 12.bxc3 Nc6 and chances look even, P.Tamburro-G.Crook, correspondence 2010.

**9.a3 Bxc3+**

9...Ba5 10.dxc5 was K.Shirazi-J.Mickael, France 2005. Play may continue 10...h5 11.f3 Nxc3 12.Nxc3 Nc6 13.Bb5 Bxc3+ 14.bxc3 Qa5 15.Bxc6+ bxc6 16.Qd4 Ba6 17.h4 when White looks slightly better since Black is loose on the kingside.

**10.Nxc3**

The other recapture 10.bxc3 Qa5 11.f3 Nxg3 12.hxg3 cxd4! , W.John-A.Nilsson, Gothenburg 1920 has Black looking slightly better after 13.Qxd4 Nc6 14.Qe3 Bd7 15.f4 O-O-O .

**10...Nxc3 11.bxc3 Qa5 12.Qd2 Nc6**

Threatening to win a pawn by capturing the d4-pawn next.

**13.dxc5**

13.h4 soon transposes after 13...Rg8 14.hxg5 hxg5 15.dxc5 Qxc5 .

**13...Qxc5 14.h4 Rg8 15.hxg5 hxg5 16.Bd3**

Black can be happy with the result of the opening. --- QUESTION: Why is that so? After all, White still retains his dark-squared bishop and didn't even have to sac a pawn for it. --- ANSWER: Firstly, his dark-squared bishop isn't all that impressive for now since it is tucked out of play on g3. White also sustained the usual structural damage for it. I would be comfortable taking on Black here.

Alternatively, 16.Rb1 b6 17.Rh5 Qxa3 18.Rxg5 Rh8 19.Bb5 Bb7 20.Ke2 O-O-O and Black looks better since his king is the safer of the two, K.Shirazi-J.Moussard, Nimes 2009.

**16...Bd7 17.Rh7 O-O-O!?**

We chess players need the initiative the way the human body is nourished and restored by food and sleep. Black's king looks out of danger and looks forward to his dream of living happily ever after.

A look at the alternatives: Black sacs a pawn to speed up development with 17...d4 18.cxd4 Nxd4 19.Kf1 Ba4 20.Rb1 Bxc2 21.Bxc2 Nxc2 22.Rxb7 Rd8 23.Qe2 Nd4 24.Qe3?? , B.Kostic-A.Baert, Stockholm 1937. --- EXERCISE (combination alert): Black lost this game after missing a chance to immediately end the game in his favour here. How can he pull it off? ( The correct path should have been 24.Qe1 Nc2 25.Qe2 Nd4 with a draw by repetition of moves ) 24...Qc2! . ANSWER: Double attack. Black missed this move. 25.Rhxf7 Nf5! which is a triple-purpose move which covers the threatened mate on e7, hits White's queen and threatens ...Rd1+. White has no choice but to resign here.

Black can also play the calm 17...Na5 18.Rb1 Rc8 when he looks better to me.

**18.Rxf7 Rh8 19.O-O-O!?**

This move looks like an overreaction to an unvoiced fear of leaving his king in the middle, yet drags with it, unwanted by-products. It increases the complications, the way wind roils sediment at the bottom of a pond, obscuring the water. Houdini says this counterintuitive move is okay but I am quite suspicious of its claim.

White should probably go for 19.Ke2 g4 when it looks to me like Black gets full compensation for the pawn in the form of attacking chances.

**19...Qxa3+ 20.Kb1 Na5 21.Qc1?!**

After this move, not-so-imperceptibly, the level of White's activity depreciates and Black takes over the initiative.

White should play 21.Qxg5 Qxc3 22.Qd2 Qc5 23.f3 Nc6 24.Bf2 Qa3 25.Rf4 when I still prefer Black's chances.

**21...Qxc3 22.Qb2**

The white queen's expression is one of absence and her smile is a tad mechanical.

**22...Qc5**

Black's queen plays with her dagger, whistling tunelessly, all the while daydreaming unspeakable thoughts about White's king. It is in Black's best interest to retain queens on the board, since White's king is exposed.

**23.Be2 Kb8 24.Rd4??**

If this isn't an entrance to hell, then it's the side entrance.

White blunders in an already difficult position when he should have tried 24.Qd4 Qa3 25.Qb2 .

**24...Rh1+ 25.Ka2**

The king intends a tirade but all which emerges is a bullfrog-like croak.

**25...Nc4**

With the deadly threat to check on a5.

**26.Qc3**

26.Bxc4 Qa5+ 27.Qa3 Ra1+! is a game-ender.

**26...Qb5**

The queen, threatening mate on b1, takes the high ground, realizing that the side with the altitude advantage is favoured on a battlefield. Meanwhile, White's king comes to a startling realization that his chronic headaches are curiously synchronized with his sister's tiresome visits.

**27.Bxc4**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Black attackers, driven by their demons, edge closer to their target. White's grievously overtaxed defenders can't hold out much longer and the tension of unsprung intent is so palpable that we could scoop it out with a spoon. Black's paradise is within reach. You alone are capable of opening the gates. --- ANSWER: Deflection.

**27...Qa4+ 28.Qa3**

The queen presses her hands over feverish ears attempting to block out the sound of her tormented thoughts, while her king ages at the equivalent rate of Moses, after the job interview with God on the summit.

28.Kb2 Qa1+ 29.Kb3 (the king's mental suffering surpasses his physical pain) 29...Rb1+ 30.Qb2 Qxb2# mate! The king begs for mercy in gulping sobs but is given none.

**28...Ra1+ !**

Stealth requires swift, noiseless motion. In this case we have the "swift", but I'm not so certain of the "noiseless" part of the equation. Just look at that four-piece pileup on the a-file! The deflection shot ends the game. When the rook, who intends to purify White's king for heresy, makes a "suggestion", everyone understands that the word is actually synonymous with "command".

**29.Kxa1 Qxa3+ 30.Kb1 dxc4**

. SUMMARY: 6 Bh4 is nothing to worry about, since White's normally terrifying dark-squared bishop remains out of play on g3 for a long time.

0-1

### (79)Manole, V.   --   Gurevich, M. 57: Andorra Open, Spain  2004   0-1   C01 (Cyrus Lakdawala)

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3**

Compare the position we get in the game with the more traditional Exchange French line 3.exd5 exd5 4.Bd3 Nc6 5.c3 Bd6 6.Nf3 Bg4 7.O-O Nge7 8.Re1 Qd7 . At least in this version, Black can considerably sharpen matters by castling long. In the game, White denies us this dynamic option.

**3...Nf6 4.exd5**

No! Not this. Anything but this! A universal truth: We French players loathe the fun-ruining buggers who deal with our beloved opening with the irritating Exchange Variation, or its obnoxious offshoots, as in this case. --- QUESTION: How is this different from a normal Exchange French? --- ANSWER: This is a delayed Exchange variant, which means fewer options for Black, since our knight is committed to f6, denying us the more dynamic Exchange French setup ...Nc6, ...Bd6 and ...Nge7, as explained in the above note. From time to time, your moody writer submerges into sullen pouts and actually gives up the French Defence (but later always returns to it, with deep contrition!), due to my monumental hatred of the Exchange Variation (and don't get me started on the Exchange Slav and Exchange Alekhine Defence!). --- QUESTION: Why would you possibly be fearful of such a milquetoast line? --- ANSWER: The Exchange French (and its variants) is a drawing weapon, often used by lower rated players to drain the position of its vitality and dynamism. I am the highest rated player in San Diego and remember one dark period when facing eight (!) straight Exchange Variations against the French. The funny thing is my score is actually quite good versus the Exchange line (over 90%), but somehow my blood boils (like Mr. Spock's during the Vulcan Pon Farr, when the normally polite Vulcan Science officer temporarily transforms into a Type A personality and flings bowls of soup at Nurse Chapel) and I begin to fight the urge to inflict the Vulcan nerve pinch on my opponents! --- QUESTION: So what is the secret to defeating the Exchange French? --- ANSWER: The secret: Be patient and look for an imbalance, since one usually arises. When you get the imbalance, you will tend to outplay your lower rated opponents and take home the full point.

**4...exd5**

QUESTION: Why must we cooperate and enter Exchange French, when we can play 4...Nxd5 ? with a funky kind of the Scandinavian Defence? --- ANSWER: It's too extreme a solution. The position actually looks to me like a favourable c3-Sicilian where White gained a tempo by avoiding c3. I prefer White's game after 5.Nxd5! (White's dullest choice!) 5...Qxd5 ( of course, 5...exd5 is painfully equal, but this is exactly what our lower rated opponent may be after ) 6.Nf3 c5 7.Be3 cxd4 8.Qxd4 Qxd4 9.Nxd4 a6 and we reach a c3-Sicilian-type ending where White benefited from saving a move from not playing c3, J.Dovzik-V.Okhotnik, Nyiregyhaza 2004.

**5.Bg5 Be7**

5...Bb4 is slightly inferior for Black since White isn't bothered by the c3-pin. Black, on the other hand, must deal with White's more potent pin on the other side of the board. After 6.Qf3 , Black is willing to allow structural damage on f6 if it removes White's dark-squared bishop and hence continued with 6...c6!? ( the trouble with 6...Nbd7 is that after 7.O-O-O?! , taking the knight on c3 or ...Be7 are clear concessions on Black's part, and if 7...c6 , 8.Re1+ is tough for Black to meet. He should probably slide his king to f8 but then White will hold an unquestioned advantage ) 7.Bd3 h6 (I insist!) 8.Bxf6 Qxf6 9.Qxf6 gxf6 , K.Spraggett-A.David, Metz 2009. White has a pleasant structural edge after 10.Ne2 .

**6.Bd3 Nc6**

After 6...O-O 7.Nge2 c6 , the game would get interesting if White played Qd2, in preparation of long castling. However, your opponent is likely to pull a fast one by playing 8.O-O with a rather stale equality.

**7.Nge2**

White plays the setup I actually prefer as Black in the Exchange line.

**7...Be6**

Black can also go for an imbalance with 7...Nb4 and if White attempts to dodge with 8.Bb5+ , Black already looks slightly better after 8...c6 9.Ba4 a5 10.a3 Na6 due to White's misplaced light-squared bishop, A.Stearns-J.Kraai, San Francisco 2000.

**8.Na4!?**

The knight's questionable trajectory looks redundant, like Hemingway needing a dictionary when he only used words under five letters in all his novels. Not all theoretical novelties are good ones. Suddenly, White looks for adventure but in reality, may be wasting time since Nc5 isn't such a scary theat.

Let's have a look at other options: GM Neil McDonald writes "Alekhine won the San Remo tournament of 1930 with 13 wins and 2 draws, his best ever tournament result. Therefore the following bore-draw represents quite an achievement for the Exchange Variation". 8.O-O h6 9.Bxf6 Bxf6 10.Bb5 Qd6 11.Bxc6+ Qxc6 12.Nf4 O-O-O 13.Nxe6 Qxe6 14.Ne2 Rde8 15.Re1 Qf5 16.c3 h5 17.Qa4 a6 18.Ng3 Rxe1+ 19.Rxe1 Qd7 20.Qxd7+ Kxd7 , R.Spielmann-A.Alekhine San Remo 1930. Definitely, this is not a good showcase of Spielmann's reputation as a fiery attacker.

Alternatively, 8.Qd2 h6 9.Bf4 Qd7 10.f3 Nb4 11.Bb5 c6 12.Ba4 also looks equal, L.Winants-M.Gurevich, France 2001.

**8...h6 9.Bxf6**

This was White's idea, to hand over the bishop pair to enter c5 with his knight. Still, I will bet the much higher-rated Gurevich breathed a little easier and felt a noticeable lightening of the spirit in finally achieving an imbalance.

**9...Bxf6 10.Nc5 Bc8!**

Gurevich holds tightly to his newly acquired bishop pair.

**11.c3**

As a drawing mechanism, McDonald recommends 11.Bb5 , for example to meet 11...Qd6 with 12.O-O O-O 13.Bxc6 Qxc6 14.c3 . However, I like Black's position, with a pair of bishops versus the knight duo.

**11...Qd6 12.O-O**

I would toss in 12.Bc2 to clear the d3-square for the knight.

**12...b6 13.Nb3 Ne7 14.Ng3 g6 15.Re1**

Black would love it if White suddenly attempted "activity" with 15.c4 O-O 16.Rc1 Bg7 17.Qf3 Be6 when Black already stood better. White can't follow up with 18.c5? bxc5 19.Rxc5 ? since it is met with the undermining shot 19...Bxd4! .

**15...O-O 16.Qd2 Kg7 17.Rad1**

White remains in waiting mode, in anticipation of Black's coming ...c5.

**17...Bg4 18.f3**

I would have avoided this weakening of the dark squares, since Black was the only one with a dark-squared bishop.

Better is the grovelly 18.Be2 .

**18...Bd7 19.Nc1 Bg5 20.Qe2 Nc6 21.Qc2**

McDonald writes: "White has run out of ideas and can only wait as Black slowly encroaches on his position. As we can see, this is not the best way to play against a much higher rated opponent. The chances of getting a result are better if you come out fighting and try to keep the advantage that the first move confers".

**21...Rfe8 22.Nf1 Re7 23.Rxe7 Qxe7 24.Ne2 Re8 25.f4 !?**

Slowly, Gurevich provokes further weakening.

**25...Bh4 26.Neg3**

26.f5?? is simply met with 26...Bxf5 27.Bxf5 Qxe2 picking off a pawn.

**26...Na5**

Clearing the path for ...c5.

**27.Rd2 c5**

Expansion at last.

**28.Re2**

Of course it is in White's best interest to avoid dxc5?! since this only opens the game for Black's bishop pair.

**28...Qd8 29.Rxe8 Bxe8 30.Qf2 Be7 31.Kh1**

If 31.f5 , Black just ignores it and plays 31...Nc6 .

**31...Nc6 32.dxc5!?**

A violation of the principle: Don't open the game when your opponent has the bishop pair. White makes another concession as he probably feared plans like ...cxd4, followed by ...Bf6, or ...c4, followed by ...b5, ...a5 and ...b4.

**32...bxc5 33.a3 h5!**

Intending...h4 and ...h3.

**34.Nd2**

White continues the waiting policy.

34.f5 gives Black's knight the e5-square after 34...Ne5 .

**34...Bd6**

The immediate 34...c4! intending ...Qb8 next, also looks promising.

**35.Ne2**

EXERCISE (planning): Gurevich found a concrete plan to create a passed pawn. How did he achieve his goal? --- ANSWER: Step 1: Fix the b2-pawn as a target.

**35...c4! 36.Bc2 Qb8**

Step 2: The queen swings around like a door hinge, attacking the b2-pawn and forcing White into a structural concession.

**37.b4**

Not much choice. Not only does this move allow Black a passed a-pawn but it also opens the position for Black's bishop pair.

**37...cxb3 38.Bxb3**

Step 3: Pick off the a3-pawn, thus creating a passed a-pawn.

**38...Bxa3 39.Bxd5**

White's passed c-pawn isn't going anywhere.

**39...Qd6 40.c4 Bb2**

Clearing the way for ...a5, ...a4 and ...a3.

**41.Ne4**

I would try 41.f5 to expose Black's king, for future perpetual check attempts.

**41...Qa3 42.g3?**

This move smears the structure with the slime of neglect and decay of the light squares.

He should play 42.h3 .

**42...Ne7!**

Halting f5 and threatening 43...Nxd5 44 cxd5 Qd3!.

**43.Ba8 Nf5 44.h3**

If White runs his c-pawn, it opens squares for Black. With 44.c5 Bb5 45.c6 Qa1+ , Black's queen addresses White's king, "Unfortunately, Your Grace, my happiness fails to coincide with yours." After 46.Kg2 , it's Black to play and deliver a powerful combination. --- EXERCISE (combination alert): White's position has the feel of too many occupants packed within too small a room. White's nervous king and queen feel anxiety on par with patients who hear their dentist rev up the drill. Black to play and force the win. --- ANSWER: Deflection. 46...Bd4! and the witch-burning bishop shimmies up the diagonal in close proximity to White's queen. He believes her to be in league with the devil. Following 47.Nxd4 Bf1+! , the bishop feels reborn and clean, drained of all wickedness. But then the feeling quickly passes and he goes back to being the ruthless person he always was by kneeling before White's king and whispering into his ear, "I will soon send you to a place where you will see-no-evil, speak-no-evil, and hear-no-evil." After 48.Qxf1 ( 48.Kg1 and the supine king isn't going anywhere soon, since g1 isn't much of a refuge either since 48...Bh3+ 49.Qf1 Qxf1# is mate! Most people don't associate brutal physical violence with females. Unless of course, you ask people who work for Black's queen ) 48...Ne3+ wins the queen. The knight's kindly tone, which he adopts as he issues the white queen's death warrant, has a way of unnerving those around him.

**44...Qd3!**

Black's queen feels she is the presiding authority over the universe with this powerful centralizing move. She gazes arrogantly at White's position with the stern disapproval of a righteous woman, entering the city gates of Babylon.

**45.Bd5**

45.c5 a5 , White's c-pawn can't continue since 46.c6?? hangs a knight after 46...Qxe4+ .

**45...a5!**

Black's a-pawn races down the board, while White's passer remains frozen on c4.

**46.Kh2 a4 47.Nc5**

Also, after 47.g4 hxg4 48.hxg4 Ne3 49.Qf3 a3 50.f5 a2 51.f6+ Kf8 , White has no way to continue the attack, while Black promotes to a new queen.

**47...Qc2**

The queen regards her would-be attacker with the tolerant amusement of a parent with a misbehaving child. There is no good defence to the coming push of Black's a-pawn.

**48.Be4**

The black queen's most diabolical weapon is her beauty, with which she entices her victims into actions they normally would find repugnant. White is in absolute desperation. Now the c4-pawn becomes unprotected, a jewel lying about on the road, a prey to the next passer-by.

**48...Qxc4**

It is no longer a "race" if there is only a single participant.

**49.Bxf5 gxf5 50.g4**

A pocket of fanatical remnants remain, but are not enough to seriously worry Black's king. White attempts a wild, final sally at Black's king, which goes nowhere.

**50...h4**

Gurevich seeks to avoid 50...a3 51.Ng3 .

**51.gxf5 a3 52.Ng1 Bc6**

. SUMMARY: Let's cast off fear of the Exchange French and its offshoots. This game is a model of how to patiently play for the win against a lower rated opponent.

0-1
