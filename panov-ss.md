## Grischuk's 13.Qc5+!? #1

Welcome to this Short & Sweet course, covering the Panov Botvinnik Attack for White. The Panov Botvinnik arises after the first five moves:

**1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5 4.c4 Nf6 5.Nc3**

I've played this opening and the associated line with

1.e4 c6 2.c4 d5 3.cxd5 cxd5 4.exd5

throughout my chess career, and find that it leads to rich, double-edged play. White often has the initiative, obtained at the cost of material or structural concessions.

**5...Nc6**

I expect that readers will face this move in most of their Panov games. It's the near-universal recommendation of authors providing recent black repertoires Schandorff, Bologan, Houska, Winterberg, Firat, Rambaldi, l'Ami, and for good reason.

Compared to 5...e6 where Black needs to be able to play complex IQP positions, and to be comfortable with transpositions to the Karpov Variation of the Rubinstein Nimzo Indian, and 5...g6 which involves a pawn sacrifice which, while interesting and playable, looks a little dubious, 5...Nc6 has a more forcing character. In terms of objective soundness, it is at least the equal of 5...e6.

Without ignoring the merits and advantages of 5...Nc6, I think there are a few factors which give White some cause for optimism. First, White can choose the type of position he wants to play.

The most fundamental choice arises on move 6, where he can select between 6.Nf3 which, in its main line, leads to a complex but balanced endgame

and 6.Bg5 which is super-sharp, especially if Black selects the critical 6...dxc4 often leading to queenless middlegames where White has a strong initiative which can be neutralised by a well-prepared black player.

Second, White has more scope to get a game than Black does. For example, after 6.Nf3 Bg4

6...g6!? and 6...Be6!? have been recommended in some sources, but I think White has reasonable chances of an advantage after those moves,

White can try the fresh 7.Bg5!? or the innocuous 7.cxd5 Nxd5 8.Be2, where there are no forced draws, and we can simply play chess.

**6.Nf3**

Knights before bishops, as they say.

6.Bg5 is the principal alternative. I rejected it because I think Black can force a draw after 6...dxc4 (not the only move) 7.Bxc4

7.d5 keeps life in the position, but does not lead to a White advantage.<level value="1"/>

7...Qxd4 8.Qxd4 Nxd4 9.O-O-O e5 10.f4 Bg4 11.Nf3 Bxf3 12.gxf3 O-O-O This is rare, but is covered by both Fernandez and Winterberg in their repertoire works. Black needs to know his stuff, but if he goes for this line he generally will.

**6...Bg4**

Developing the bishop and pinning the knight, while exerting some pressure on the white centre (especially the d4-pawn). As we see in other openings where the queen's bishop is developed early (such as the Trompowsky and London Systems), this move has a small downside that the b-pawn is weakened. In the main line we will see White take advantage of this with an early Qb3. 6...g6!? is suggested by Houska and Firat, and is a serious option. This isn't a simple transposition to 5...g6, since White generally doesn't develop his Knight to f3 in that line.<level start="5...g6" value="+1"/>

We'll cover 6...g6 later in this course and I dedicate a full chapter on it in the main course.

6...Be6!? is another sideline with a reasonable pedigree, and was given by Bologan as an alternative to the main line. We will look at it soon.

6...e6 transposes to a sideline of 5...e6 6.Nf3, and we'll cover it in the main course.

**7.cxd5**

White decides to resolve the central tension, because he's spotted some tactical weaknesses on d5 and b7. He also benefits from the black knight coming to d5, since it shields the d4-pawn from attack by the black queen (which, in combination with the c6-knight and the g4-bishop, was starting to exert unpleasant pressure).

**7...Nxd5**

Taking a central pawn while removing the attack on the c6-knight.

**8.Qb3**

Initiating a very sharp tactical sequence. As often happens, such sequences can end up in simplifications and relatively dry positions, but both sides have opportunities to deviate. The alternative 8.Be2 is a safe (some might, correctly, say 'cowardly') line I've used on occasion. White will castle, play h3 and Qb3, and claim that his light initiative and lead in development counts for more than Black's superior structure. This line can be played with little or no preparation by both sides, and it is hardly a critical or threatening attempt.

**8...Bxf3**

This should be included without thinking. Black spoils the white structure and compromises the defence of the d4-pawn. The g4-bishop could otherwise have become a tactical target, Ne5 could have been an option, and generally this move must be played.

**9.gxf3**

Take that bishop! It's not immediately obvious why 9.Qxb7?? (which has been played in several games) is a bad move, but the answer is 9...Ndb4!, when the threats of ...Nc2+ and, in particular, ...Rb8 (trapping the queen) give Black a very winning position. Of course it looks slightly murky and White has even won some games from here, but my editors have told me I'm not allowed to recommend lines which start with an assessment of -7, so I'll finish my coverage here.

**9...e6**

Solidly defending the knight and opening a line for the f8-bishop to develop.

**10.Qxb7**

White can't switch to slow play yet, his structure is shattered and his centre is collapsing, so he needs to keep shooting until he runs out of bullets.

**10...Nxd4**

Another move which achieves an awful lot, dealing with the threat to the knight, re-establishing material parity, and creating an unpleasant threat of ...Nc2+. Alternatives are not to be recommended, and are discussed in the main course.

**11.Bb5+!**

This disruptive move is key. Simply taking on d5 would give Black a very comfortable endgame.

**11...Nxb5**

No choice.

**12.Qc6+!**

Another precise disruptive move.

**12...Ke7**

Because the white queen is attacking the rook on a8, 12...Qd7?? isn't an option. It's worth reminding readers that.

**13.Qc5+!?**

An incredible idea, uncorked by Grischuk against Vidit in the World Rapid in Doha, 2016. At first sight this move looks like a horrible blunder, that White has become confused with the subtle Qxb7-c6+ sidesteps, and that he will resign once 13... Nd6 lands on the board. However, things are not so simple at all.

The move post-dates Schandorff's book, and isn't mentioned by Fernandez, Winterberg, or Rambaldi in their works, although Bologan's book has some good coverage. I was given advance access to Erwin l'Ami's Lifetime Repertoires Caro-Kann course, and his proposed response is excellent. Generally, I would not expect to particularly surprise one's opponent with this line, but rather to rely on the relatively fresh and challenging positions which tend to arise.

In the main course I've given some outline analysis of the more traditional 13.Qxb5 which, in my view, poses Black fewer practical problems.

**13...Nd6**

Unsurprisingly, this has been Black's choice in correspondence chess. It is also Bologan's recommendation. Some alternatives have been tested and are covered in the full repertoire!

**14.Nxd5+**

White needs to open some lines to justify dropping a piece.

**14...Kd7!?**

A sophisiticated defence, returning the piece to complete development. Attacking play was a lot easier in the 19th century when gentlemen were obliged to accept all sacrifices.

**15.Nc3**

Even here engines nonchalantly suggest leaving the knight *en prise* by bringing the Bishop to e3. I think we've shown enough bravery/preparation/ calculation for the moment, and we don't need to blame ourselves for a temporary retreat. White has achieved what he wanted, namely to keep the queens on against a black king which is awkwardly placed in the centre.

**15...Qb6**

Unsuprisingly, Black takes the chance to bring out his queen with tempo, since the trade is not in White's favour.

**16.Qh5**

Endgames are not great news for White at the moment, since he's relying on activity against the black king to compensate for his poor structure. A couple of queen moves have been tried in practice but this is my favourite, as played in the stem game. The queen targets f7 and defends f3, plus it's the engine's preference.

**16...Ke8**

A good move, defending f7 (and so allowing the black knight to occupy an excellent square on f5, controlling important central squares and temporarily cutting the white queen off from the queenside) while allowing the black bishop to develop on the a3-f8 diagonal.

**17.O-O**

Putting the king into relative safety while developing the rook. Castling is often a good move, and White's main trump in this position is that he can do it, while Black cannot. In the main course we continue searching here, but Black holds with precise play.

### Fork 14...exd5

**14...exd5**

Taking the knight is critical, not because it's better than 14...Kd7 (it isn't - both lines lead to equality with best play) but because White is a piece down and needs to play energetically both to create chances, and not to lose. I will again take a correspondence game as our model, since these guys tend to show the way. This is also the line recommended by Erwin l'Ami in his Lifetime Repertoires course.

**15.O-O**

Putting the king into relative safety and preparing to deliver check from e1.

15.Qxd5 has also been played in some games and is more or less as good (it can even transpose), but bringing another piece into the attack is better attacking technique and so should be preferred in principle.

**15...Qb6**

Opening the way for the a8-rook to join the action (and perhaps to exchange a white rook). Of course White can't trade queens, which would lead to a hopeless endgame. I've also covered several alternatives in the main course. Some hold, some don't.

**16.Qxd5**

Avoiding the queen exchange, taking a pawn and attacking the rook on a8. At first sight this looks dangerous for Black but, as we have come to expect, engines tell us it's a draw.

**16...Re8**

A good developing and prophylactic move, preparing to trade Rooks on the e-file. After writing the material for this course, I saw Erwin l'Ami's analysis of the Panov, where he recommends this precise variation for Black. After 17.Re1+, as he correctly notes, the game ends in a draw by force.

**17.Rd1!?**

I decided to develop this line which (as far as I can tell) is a novelty. Black equalises with a few precise moves, but a couple are counterinuitive. Objectively the position is a draw after both 17.Rd1 and 17.Re1+ Both moves are covered in some detail in the main course.

## Fork 9...Nb6

**9...Nb6**

A very sharp line with a slightly dubious reputation (relative to 9...e6, which has always been regarded as a clean equaliser), but one which has been repeatedly played by strong GMs who know what they're doing, such as Dreev. I've previously played and recommended 10.Be3 followed by long castling, but for this course I was attracted by an ambitious alternative (played about as often as 10.Be3) which immediately seizes space and gains time.

**10.d5**

Asking Black a question. He really should know the answer.

**10...Ne5??**

This has been played in 30 games, but after

**11.Bb5+**

Black's co-ordination is disrupted.

### Fork 10...Nd4

**10...Nd4**

The only move.

Your move 

**11.Bb5+**

This has been played slightly less often than 11.Qd1, but it's the engines' favourite and, in my opinion, the better move.

**11...Nd7**

Again, all but the worst prepared players will know this move if they are going for 9... Nb6.

11...Nxb5? is a natural move but also a big mistake which has been played more often than it should have, and I give the refutation in the main course.

**12.Qa4**

Attacking all of the knights.

**12...Nxb5**

12...Nxf3+ is too greedy, as your neural network will tell you. For the refutation, see the full course!

**13.Qxb5 g6 14.O-O**

Quick development is the most logical option. White doesn't want to allow Black to consolidate.

**14...Bg7 15.Re1 O-O**

Continuing to offer the b7-pawn. We're still not interested.

**16.Bg5 Bf6**

By far the most common and well-established move. One of Black's ideas, if White takes on f6, is to recapture with the e7-pawn, thus eliminating his weakness on e7. Even with a normal configuration of White pawns on the kingside (i.e. with the f3-pawn on g2), the resulting structure could be excellent for Black if his pieces were placed correctly and, in particular, if his knight were on d6, blockading the d5-pawn and protecting the b7-pawn.

I learned about this structure from Gawain Jones (who used it to crush me in Kilkenny 2012!).

In the full course I also cover the major alternatives here such as 16...Re8 and 16...Bxc3!?

**17.h4!?**

I suppose it won't surprise anyone to learn that this is Leela's preference. Instead of exchanging bishops, White plays for a bind. His structure is ugly, but effective. The d5-pawn controls space and leaves the e7-pawn rather weak. White's kingside structure is far from ideal, but the black pieces are too passive to exploit it. We cover some alternatives in the main course, but my main line continues

**17...a6 18.Qe2 Re8 19.Rad1⩲**

I think White has the better chances, and that his position is much easier to play. Despite cosmetic defects, his pawn structure controls a lot of space. The e7-pawn requires protection and the d6-advance is a dynamic possibility which Black must constantly monitor. All the white pieces are more active than their counterparts. Black is relying on his solid structure and a blockade. White's next moves to improve his position will probably include Kg2 and Ne4. Note that ...Bxg5 hxg5 is a very double-edged decision by Black, due to the half-open h-file and control of the f6-square.

## Fork 6...g6

**6...g6**

This move was recommended by GM Burak Firat and IM Jovanka Houska in their respective repertoire series. Black rejects 6...Bg4, perhaps dissatisfied with his prospects in the endgame, and prefers to play a complicated middlegame. In fact this move is a direct transposition into a popular line of the Symmetrical English, namely 1.c4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 g6 4.e3 Nf6 5.d4 cxd4 6.exd4 d5.

White has tried a number of moves here. I've gone with the most popular one, which in my opinion is both objectively best and leads to positions where White has easier play.

**7.cxd5 Nxd5 8.Qb3!**

This is the most precise move order.

8.Bc4 doesn't lead to the same thing since Black can deviate with 8...Nb6 This position is far from unplayable for White, but it's not our intention.

**8...Nxc3**

The most popular move. Black would be very comfortable after 9.bxc3 Bg7 followed by castling, but White has a useful intermezzo.

**9.Bc4!**

Creating some trouble on f7. Black has two reasonable responses.

**9...Nd5**

Keeping the d4-pawn isolated.

9...e6 is a major alternative. 10.bxc3 Bg7 11.Ba3 Na5 is Burak Firat's recommendation in his repertoire series, and I think I've proven some advantage for White in the main course after a lot of analysis.

**10.Bxd5 e6 11.Bxc6+**

By far the most popular move, and the one favoured by Stockfish and Leela. The very rare 11.Be4 could be tried if you just want to get a game, but it's not a suitable move to build your repertoire around.

**11...bxc6 12.O-O Bg7**

has been played in over 100 games, but allows a more harmonious setup after

**13.Bf4 O-O 14.Qe3**

### Fork 12...Qd5

**12...Qd5**

Putting the queen in the middle with tempo and solidly blockading the d4-pawn is logical, and is by far the most popular.

12...f6 is logical, controlling the e5-square. ...Kf7 and/or ...Be7 are useful options. 13.Qe3 has always been met by 13...Qd5 transposing to 13...f6.<skip start="13...f6"/>

**13.Qe3**

This is Leela's preference, was recommended by Kiril Georgiev and Semko Semkov in their English repertoire book, and has led to good results for White. Moves like 13.Be3 and 13.Qc3 are more popular. In Houska's repertoire book, 13.Qe3 is dismissed as "looks clumsy and is well met by 13...f6

13...Bg7 is also possible, but White can repeat with 14.Qa3 Bf8 15.Qe3

**13...Bg7**

Developing and preparing to castle. Houska's suggestion

13...f6 is very logical and has been tried in some correspondence games. I have some thoughts on this(and 13th move alternatives) which we discuss in the main course.

**14.Bd2**

A modest move, but a good one.

**14...O-O 15.Rfc1**

White has achieved a really harmonious setup. His dark-square bind is very effective, and Black won't be able to achieve ...c5 or ...e5 any time soon. White's next move is likely to be Rc5, when he has options of putting further pressure on the c6-pawn with Rac1. Ba5 is a nice resource in some cases, preventing ...a5 (which could improve prospects for the a8-rook and c8-bishop) and interfering with Black's plans to pressure the d4-pawn by taking control of the d8-square.

Ne5 is also an important resource, leaving Black with a difficult choice. Leaving the knight on e5 is unlikely to be an option (c6 will hang in most cases), but taking on e5 could lead to a very unpleasant opposite-coloured bishop middlegame where Black has weak queenside pawns and weak dark-squares around his king. ...f6 takes control of important squares, but leaves the e6-pawn requiring piece protection.

Finally, in these AlphaZero times, we should all be willing to play h4-h5 at the first opportunity. We go further in the course but, if you like this position, you will probably do well against the 6...g6 variation.

## Fork 6...Be6

**6...Be6**

An interesting line and a favourite of strong players against weaker opponents in big blitz events. Bologan covered this move in his book, as an alternative to 6...Bg4, so you can expect to face it from time to time.

**7.Qb3**

Moving the bishop leaves b7 undefended, so this move always has to be considered.

7.c5 is the most popular move and might also give White good chances. I've recommended 7.Qb3 instead both because I think it's a high quality move ( Bologan gives White an edge, and I agree), and because the early tactical confrontation on the queenside is more consistent with the rest of our repertoire.

**7...Na5**

with the excellent queen sacrifice

**8.Qb5+ Bd7 9.cxd5!**

We cover Black's 9th move alternatives in the main course, but it's important to know that taking the queen with

**9...Bxb5**

doesn't end well after

**10.Bxb5+ Nd7 11.Ne5±**

Lines where White regains the queen by taking on d7 for instance after 11...g6 or 11...a6 leave him with an extra pawn and good winning chances in the endgame. Black can try to avoid returning the queen with

**11...Qc7 12.Bxd7+ Kd8 13.Bf4!**

is crushing. Stockfish's top three lines involve the Queen taking a minor piece on d7, e5 or c3, which isn't a good sign. If the Queen remains evasive with

**13...Qb6**

then

**14.Bb5 Qxd4 15.Nxf7+ Kc8 16.Be3 Qb4 17.Rc1+−**

leads to a position where White already has two minor pieces and a pawn for the queen, he can capture on h8 at leisure, and he has a vicious attack. I trust you guys to figure it out!


### Fork 7...dxc4

**7...dxc4**

This approach is critical.

**8.Qxb7 Rc8**

This was only played in one game in my database, but it is Bologan's main line, so it could be expected from a well prepared black player. I also cover the alternatives 8...Na5 and 8...Qc8 in the main course.

**9.Qb5 a6!?**

Taking on a6 allows Black to take on d4, so this is actually quite clever.

**10.Qa4 Nd5 11.Ne5 Qa5**

Thus far we are following Bologan, who goes on to find a white edge after taking on a5. I prefer

**12.Nxc6 Qxa4 13.Nxa4 Rxc6 14.Nc5**

when the c4-pawn is under attack. I give some more analysis from here in the full repertoire, concluding that White's position is at least easier to play, if not objectively better.

## Fork 5...e6

**5...e6**

This is one of my favourite lines to meet in practice but, surprisingly, it was the hardest line to deal with when preparing the material for this series. I'll give some explanation of my choices along the way. Throughout the material in this section, we will see very typical positions where White has an isolated queen's pawn (IQP). In fact, these positions are so typical that we can often transpose into other openings, especially the Semi Tarrasch, but also the Nimzo Indian, c3-Sicilian, Symmetrical English etc.

**6.Nf3**

A very natural developing move, especially when there's no ... Bg4 in the position.

**6...Be7**

is almost as popular as 6...Bb4, and perhaps more so if one includes all the Semi-Tarrasch transpositions. As against 6...Bb4, I recommend clarifying the central tension with

**7.cxd5 exd5**

Going into a symmetrical structure is always a serious option and is discussed. My main line proceeds

**8.Bd3 O-O 9.h3 Nc6 10.O-O⩲**

This is a symmetrical position where White plays for two results, since his d3-bishop is more active than its counterpart on e7, and the c8-bishop is restricted.

### Fork 7...Nxd5

**7...Nxd5 8.Bd3 Nc6 9.O-O O-O**

White has a pleasant choice in this position, although Black remains solid. I like

**10.Re1**

Now 10...Bf6 is solid and best, and is our main focus after 6...Be7. Instead

**10...Nf6**

is one of those classic IQP positions which can be reached from half a dozen openings. This is an excellent version for White.

**11.a3 b6 12.Bg5!**

The more direct 12.Bc2 is well met by 12...Ba6! disrupting White's attacking setup.

**12...Bb7 13.Bc2**

Only now that the black bishop has committed to b7, White sets up the standard queen and bishop battery on the b1-h7 diagonal.

**13...Rc8 14.Qd3**

Threatening Bxf6, so Black doesn't have much choice.

**14...g6 15.Rad1**

White scores heavily from this position. All of his pieces occupy good positions, and Black hasn't managed to trade any minor pieces, so he's slightly cramped. Generally speaking, once ...g6 has been played, the bishop doesn't have much to do on c2, so it will re-route itself to b3 or a4. We discuss this position in some detail in the course, but to take one example of how dangerous Black's position is, let's look at the logical

**15...a6**

preparing ...b5.

**16.Bb3!**

Redeploying the bishop to its best diagonal.

**16...Na5 17.Ba2 b5 18.Ne5**

White has a range of threats including Bxe6 followed by Nxg6.

**18...Nd5 19.Bh6 Re8 20.Qh3**

Now Nxf7 is a real threat.

**20...Bf6 21.Ne4±**

White is positionally better, and won quickly after

**21...Bg7? 22.Bxg7 Kxg7 23.Nxf7+−**

in M.Kobalia - I.Rozum, St Petersburg 2015 (1-0 in 33).

### Fork 6...Bb4

**6...Bb4**

Pinning the c3-knight is the most ambitious move.

**7.cxd5**

I've always preferred this move, which keeps the game in Panov territory.

7.Bd3 dxc4 8.Bxc4 O-O 9.O-O b6 transposes to the 'Karpov Variation' of the Nimzo Indian: 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 O-O 5.Bd3 c5 6.Nf3 d5 7.O-O dxc4 8.Bxc4 cxd4 9.exd4 b6, which has a good reputation for Black.

**7...Nxd5**

The most ambitious recapture, maintaining a better structure and creating an immediate threat on c3.

**8.Qc2**

My favourite move, defending the c3-Knight, although I've gone for a less common continuation on the next move.

8.Bd2 is the main alternative. This can also transpose into Semi-Tarrasch or Nimzo positions in some cases. After 8...Nc6 9.Bd3 O-O 10.O-O Be7 Leela shows a strong preference for 11.Nxd5 I would prefer the most popular move 11.Nxd5 exd5 12.h3 as essayed in G.Jones - A. Giri, Wijk aan Zee 2018(draw in 25 moves). White even has a modest minus score here, which is unsurprising(such symmetrical lines are often chosen by players with lower ratings than their opponents, and passive play is as dangerous in symmetrical positions as anywhere else). I can't find any edge here, and this isn't suitable for a main repertoire choice.

**8...Nc6**

Overwhelmingly Black's most popular choice, but not his only reasonable move, and we discuss the alternatives in some detail in the main course.

**9.Bc4**

This is Leela's preference, and leads to standard positions with an IQP. I've also found an interesting idea after Black's most common move (9...Nb6), which makes this line quite attractive for White. It's also not mentioned by Rambaldi, who covers 5...e6 as an alternative to his main recommendation (5...Nc6).

**9...Nb6**

The most popular move, and a natural response to Bc4 since both the bishop and the d4-pawn are hanging. We also cover the lines 9...O-O and 9...Qc7 in the full repertoire.

**10.Bd3!?**

This pawn sacrifice is Leela's big idea, and I'm delighted to present its analysis!

10.Bb5 has been White's universal over-the-board choice (including GMs Andreikin, Savic and Timman), but correspondence players have shown that White can sacrifice the d4-pawn.

**10...h6**

Declining the pawn doesn't make much sense. After

**11.a3 Bd6 12.O-O O-O 13.Re1⩲**

White has a very pleasant IQP position, where the b6-knight is sorely missed from f6.
