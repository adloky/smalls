### (1) Icelandic Gambit [B01] [David Smerdon]

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6**

The start of the Icelandic (or 'Palme') Gambit, which, despite its dubious nature, remains dangerous at all levels.

**4.dxe6 Bxe6**

Now we have a real gambit! Black intends rapid development, whirling all of her pieces towards the centre in an effort to catch White out before she has time to complete her mobilization. Typical deployment for Black includes .. .Nc6, a further advancement of the light-squared bishop to f5 or g4, and ... Bc5 (if d2-d4 can be prevented) or ...Bb4 (in response to d2-d4). Also, with both kings exposed on the newly-opened e-file, Black often opts to throw in a quick ...Qe7 beforehand in order to disrupt White's coordination. White has plenty of chances to go wrong in this gambit, but with a precise sequence of moves, she is reckoned to be able to neutralize Black's pressure and begin to capitalize on the extra material. Fortunately, Black can eschew the theoretical main line with the important improvement 7...Bf5!, leading to an endgame in which her compensation seems to be sufficient. This will be the subject of our first illustrative game:<skip/>

### (2) Pruess,D. - Gareev,T. [B01] Cappelle la Grande, 2007 [David Smerdon] 

At the 2004 World Junior Championships in Kochin, India, I was assigned to share a room with the representative from Uzbekistan: an exuberant, thickly-accented sixteen-year-old by the name of Timur Gareyev. One couldn't help but be immediately attracted to his charming eccentricities and his unflappably positive attitude. It was during this event that I first really tested out the 3...Bg4 Scandinavian against quality opposition, repeating the opening four times in the tournament. The opening held up well, and I scored a crushing victory over Filipino GM Mark Paragua (see Game 3 in the Jadoul chapter of Section One) and made an important draw with Erwin L'Ami, who would later go on to become one of the top grandmasters in the Netherlands. --- Timur, being present at both my morning preparation and poolside post-mortem sessions, asked many questions about "dis crayzee beeshop jee-four gambit", and we had a lot of fun analysing the positions during our Indian fortnight as roommates. Later on, I discovered that Timur had taken up the opening (in addition to cross-country motorbike riding, skydiving and breaking world blindfold chess records - but those are other stories). In this game, Timur, by now a strong grandmaster, shows a deep understanding of Black's endgame compensation in the Icelandic Gambit, playing it in a mature manner.<skip/>

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6 4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.Nf3 Qe7!**

This strange move may look ugly at first site, but it echoes a similar principle of the ...Qe7/Qe2 insertion of the Mieses Scotch: White's development is more inconvenienced by her awkward queen placement than Black's.

**6.Qe2 Nc6 7.d4 Bf5!**

[7...Bg4 is also possible and has in the past been considered the main line. But recent analysis seems to suggest that, after 8.Be3 , White can allow doubled f-pawns in exchange for the bishop pair, promising her a small advantage.; Black's chances after the more dynamic text are objectively strongest; note that 7...Bf5 8.Be3? would now be met by 8...Nb4! .]

**8.Qxe7+**

[If 8.a3 then 8...Na5! prepares ...c5.]

**8...Bxe7 9.Be3**

[Again, 9.a3 should be met by 9...Na5! intending ...c7-c5; see line B33 in the theory section.]

**9...Nb4! 10.Na3**

White has managed to develop some pieces, but the knight on a3 and the rook on a1 remain occupied by the defence of the c2-square and the a2-pawn.

**10...Ne4?!**

[10...O-O! was better, when Black's rooks are preparing to take control of the central files. For example, 11.h3 (or 11.Be2 Ng4 12.O-O Nxe3 13.fxe3 g6 g6 and the bishop pair promises sufficient compensation) 11...c6 12.Be2 Rfe8 13.O-O Rad8 14.Rfd1 Bd6 with full compensation for the pawn. Black can continue with ...b7-b6, ...h7-h6 and slowly improve her position, whereas it is hard to suggest how White can make progress with such tangled pieces. Note that Black often has the useful resource ...Bc2.]

**11.Be2 Bf6 12.O-O O-O-O 13.Ne5!**

This strong move is the problem with Black's chosen set-up. White is clearly better, so Timur comes up with a highly imaginative way to muddy the waters.

**13...c5!?**

[Objectively, 13...Bxe5 14.dxe5 Rhe8 was stronger, but White remains better after 15.g4 Bd7 16.f3 Nf6 17.Bf4! .]

**14.f3**

[The greedy 14.Nxf7? cxd4 15.Nxd8 Rxd8 is fine for Black. For instance, after 16.Bf4?? she has 16...g5! 17.Bg3 d3! 18.Bf3 Nxg3 19.fxg3 (or 19.hxg3 g4) 19...Bd4+! 20.Kh1 Bxb2 21.Rab1 Bxa3 22.Rb3 d2! 23.Rxa3 Re8! 24.Bd1 Re1 25.Raf3 Bc2 and Black wins in emphatic fashion.]

**14...Nd2 15.Rfd1**

[Not 15.Bxd2? Bxe5 and Black equalizes.]

**15...Nb1!**

The only chance.

**16.Raxb1**

[16.Nxb1?? Nc2! leads to a draw by perpetual check after 17.Nxf7 Nxe3 18.Nc3 Bxd4 19.Rdc1 Nc2+ 20.Kf1 Ne3+ .]

**16...Bxb1 17.Nxb1 cxd4 18.Bd2! d3 19.Bf1 Bxe5 20.Bxb4 Bd4+ 21.Kh1 Bxb2 22.Nc3!**

White has successfully navigated the tactical mKl�e and finds himself with a decisive material advantage. David's technique is solid.

**22...d2 23.Nd5 Bc1 24.Bxd2 Bxd2 25.Rxd2 Rhe8 26.Rd1 Rd6 27.Kg1 Ra6 28.Nc3 Rd8 29.Bd3 g6 30.Bc2 Rxd1+ 31.Bxd1 Rd6 32.Bb3 Rd2 33.Nd5 Rd3 34.Kf2 f5?? 35.Nf6??**

[I am a little sceptical of the official game record in my database around this point, because 35.Ke2 rather simply wins the rook.]

**35...Rd2+ 36.Kg3 h5 37.h4 Kc7 38.Nd5+ Kd6 39.Nf4 Kc5 40.Nxg6 a5 41.Nf4 Kb4 42.c5 a4 43.Be6 Kxc5 44.Nxh5 1-0**

### (3) Degraeve,JM. - Ekstroem,R. [B01] European Championship, Ohrid, 2001 [David Smerdon] 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6 4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.Be2**

[Avoiding 5.Nf3 Qe7! in this way is safe and sensible, but hardly critical. Black gains full compensation with natural development.]

**5...Nc6 6.Nf3 Bc5 7.O-O O-O 8.d3 Re8 9.Nbd2**

Again, White opts for a timid response, but the knight is heading for b3 where it will control the key d4-square. [Instead, 9.Nc3 Bf5 creates ideas of ...Qd7, ...Rad8 and ...Nd4.]

**9...Bf5**

[Here 9...a5! 10.Nb3 Ba7 is logical. Then 11.a4 (while 11.d4 can be met by 11...a4!) 11...Nb4! 12.d4 Bf5 leaves White's queenside full of holes.]

**10.Nb3 Rxe2!**

A nice move to play, if practically forced.

**11.Nxc5! Re8 12.d4**

[12.Nxb7! was stronger, although White was understandably hesitant about further pawn-grabbing with such underdevelopment.]

**12...Bg4 13.Be3 Bxf3 14.Qxf3**

[14.gxf3 b6 15.Nb3 Qd7! gives Black excellent chances against White's broken kingside: ...Ne7 is coming, followed by an assault by the deadly attacking combination of Black's queen and two knights.]

**14...Nxd4**

Black's aggressive play has been rewarded by the recovery of the sacrificed pawn and, more importantly, the destruction of White's centre. At this point Degraeve should have been looking to minimize his disadvantage. Instead, he captures the poisoned b7-pawn on its second offering, to his great regret.

**15.Qxb7? Rb8! 16.Qxa7 Ne2+ 17.Kh1 Ng4 18.g3 Qf6 19.Kg2 Rxb2!**

This move springs echoes of the game(Nabaty-Chatalbashev) from the Classical variation, and indeed, another 'black knights' tango' checkmate is imminent...

**20.Na4 Qc6+ 21.f3 Nf4+!**

[After 21...Nf4+! 22.Kh1 Rxh2+ 23.Kg1 Nh3# mate, the black knights get the final say.]

**0-1**

### (4) Sokolov,An - Speelman,J. [B01] Madrid, 1988 [David Smerdon] 

This was an historically important encounter for the development of this variation, as well as adding some powerful Elo weight to the reputation of the gambit.

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6 4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.d4?!**

Common, but weak. After all, if White could play this without fear of retribution, Black's gambit would hardly be playable at all!

**5...Bb4+!**

Black must respond energetically.

**6.Bd2 Qe7 7.Bxb4 Qxb4+ 8.Nd2**

[If 8.Qd2 Nc6 9.Nc3 O-O-O 10.d5 , the novelty 10...Ne5!! favours Black.]

**8...Nc6!**

Black must have no fear in the Icelandic, and be willing to sacrifice a piece on d5 in several lines.

**9.Ngf3 O-O-O 10.d5 Bg4?**

This works out for Speelman in the game, [but Black could have finished the contest immediately: 10...Nxd5!! 11.cxd5 Bxd5 is extremely powerful, intending ...Bxf3, ...Rhe8 and a likely occupation of d4 by the knight. Black's position is crushing, e.g. 12.Be2 Bxf3 13.gxf3 Rhe8 and wins.]

**11.Be2?**

Returning the favour. [11.dxc6! Rhe8+ 12.Be2 Nh5! gives Black dangerous play for the piece, but at least the game continues. For example, 13.O-O Nf4 14.Re1 Rxe2 15.Rxe2 Bxf3 16.gxf3 bxc6 17.Re4 Rxd2 18.Qf1 Ne6 with excellent compensation for the exchange.]

**11...Bxf3! 12.Bxf3 Rhe8+ 13.Kf1 Nd4**

The pawn on b2 could also have been taken, but Speelman is hunting bigger fish.

**14.Qc1 Nxf3 15.Nxf3 Re4**

[Here 15...b5! would have fatally demolished the last bastions of White's central structure.]

**16.b3 Rde8 17.h3 Nh5!?**

The most aggressive option, [although 17...b5 would again have left Black with a clear advantage.]

**18.g3 Nxg3+!**

Black's second knight sacrifice, and we haven't even reached move twenty!

**19.fxg3 Re3 20.Ng1?**

[Black's attack certainly looks menacing after 20.Kg2 Re2+ , but in the cold light of engine analysis it appears that White can survive: 21.Kf1 Qb6 22.Rh2! Rxh2 (22...Qf6 23.Rf2!! R8e3 24.Qd1 holds on) 23.Nxh2 Qf6+ 24.Kg2 Re2+ 25.Kh1 Qe5 26.Qf1! and Black's attack yields no more than a draw.]

**20...Qd6!**

The queen makes a deadly switch to the kingside. White's position is indefensible.

**21.Rh2 Rxg3! 22.Qb2 Qg6 23.Kf2 Ree3!**

Total domination.

**24.Ne2 Rgf3+ 25.Ke1 Qg1+ 26.Kd2 Qxh2 27.Re1 Qf2 0-1**

### (5) Icelandic Gambit - 3 c4 e6 [B01] [David Smerdon] 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6 4.dxe6**

[Other moves: 4.Qa4+?! Bd7 5.Qb3 exd5 6.cxd5 Na6! gives Black excellent compensation.; 4.d4 invites another quirky transposition, this time to a variation of the Exchange French. Black has a number of promising lines that secure excellent chances; my personal preference is 4...exd5 5.Nc3 Bb4 6.Nf3 O-O 7.Be2 dxc4 8.Bxc4 Bg4 9.O-O Nc6 10.Be3 and now 10...Qd6!? with an equal game, as first played by a young Magnus Carlsen (aged 11), in Ro.Sander-Ma.Carlsen, Bergen 2002.]

**4...Bxe6**

We are already at an important junction:

**5.--**

[5.d4?! (see variation A); 5.Nf3! (see variation B); Instead: 5.Nc3?! is not a great move to begin with, and 5...Nc6 6.Nf3 Qe7 7.g3?? is even worse! White resigned this seven-move gem without waiting for ...Bg4+ or ...Bd5+ in J_Dime (2180)-D.Smerdon, Internet 2013. (But Black regains her pawn on c4 in any case, since 7.Qe2? Nb4! 8.d4 Bf5 is better for Black.) ; 5.Be2 Nc6 6.Nf3 Bc5! gives Black good compensation. The combination of White's slow development and weaknesses on the semi-open d-file offer Black plenty of play. Black should simply pile up on White's backward d-pawn. Play might continue 7.O-O and then: 7...-- a) 7...O-O! 8.d3 (or 8.Nc3 Re8 9.d3 Bf5 10.Bg5 h6 11.Bh4 Nd4 with a balanced game) 8...Re8 9.Nbd2 a5! (9...Bf5 was the game (Degraeve-Ekstroem)) 10.Nb3 Ba7 11.a4 (or 11.d4 a4!) 11...Nb4 12.d4 Bf5 and Black has a strong initiative for the pawn.; b) 7...Qd7!? is more ambitious, although in my opinion Black's compensation is of a more positional nature, and thus queenside castling is perhaps unnecessarily risky: 8.d3 O-O-O 9.Nbd2 Bf5?! (9...a5) 10.Nb3 Bd4 11.Nbxd4 Nxd4 12.Nxd4 Qxd4 13.Be3 Qxb2 14.Rb1 Qa3 15.Qb3?! (but 15.Rb3! would have been very dangerous) 15...Qxb3 16.Rxb3 Rhe8 was acceptable for Black in A.Onischuk-Art.Minasian, European Team Championship, Batumi 1999.; ]

### (6) Icelandic Gambit - A: 5 d4?! [B01] [David Smerdon] 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6 4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.d4?!**

The most ambitious, "I don't believe you", counter to Black's gambit. White seeks to squeeze the maximum out of her position, taking control of the centre. However, this attempted refutation backfires.

**5...Bb4+!**

White is attempting to steamroll Black through the centre, so the gambiteer must strike quickly.

**6.Bd2**

[If 6.Nc3 then 6...Ne4! is very strong. 7.Qd3 (7.Bd2? Qxd4 8.Nxe4 Qxe4+ is already winning for Black, A.Karacsony-At.Kiss, Veszprem 1995) 7...Bf5! 8.a3 (8.Bd2?! O-O! is crushing; e.g. 9.Nge2 Re8 10.Nxe4 Bxe4 11.Qg3 Bxd2+ 12.Kxd2 Nc6 13.Kc3 Nxd4!! 14.Nxd4 c5 led to a quick mate in H. Yasin-I.Koc, Turkish Team Championship 2008) 8...Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 O-O 10.Qf3 Re8 White's position is in tatters with only a queen to represent her development, and she will soon come under a crushing attack. One violent example continued 11.Be3 Qd7 12.h3 Nxc3 13.Qxb7? Nc6 14.Qb3 Qxd4 15.Rc1 Rxe3+!! 16.fxe3 Qh4+ 17.Kd2 Ne4+ 0-1 R.Dicu-C.Florescu, Rumanian Team Championship 2011.]

**6...Qe7**

[6...Bxd2+ is slightly weaker, though not without venom. If you wish to investigate this move, I would recommend the as-yet unplayed sacrificial line 7.Qxd2 Qe7 8.Qe3 O-O 9.d5 Ng4! 10.Qe2 Re8! 11.dxe6 Qf6 12.Qf3 Qxe6+ 13.Be2 Nc6 with a dangerous attack for the piece.]

**7.Bxb4**

The most popular move, but perhaps not the best. [7.Qe2?! seems plausible and can arise by transposition from line B1, but 7...Nc6 8.Nf3 O-O-O 9.d5 Rhe8!! gives Black an overwhelming attack: 10.dxe6 (similarly, both 10.dxc6 Qc5!; and 10.Nc3 Bxc3 11.Bxc3 Qc5! open the e-file to decisive effect) 10...Qc5 11.Nc3 (or 11.g3 Qf5! and wins) 11...Rxd2! 12.Qxd2 Rxe6+ 13.Kd1 (13.Be2 Ne4! wins on the spot) 13...Bxc3 14.Qxc3 Ne4 15.Qxg7 Nxf2+ 16.Kc1 Qe3+ 17.Kb1 was T.Nagley-P.Corbat, correspondence 2000, and now, somewhat surprisingly for a correspondence game, Black missed a win with 17...Qe4+! 18.Kc1 Nxh1 19.b3 Nf2 20.Kb2 Rd6 with a crushing attack.; 7.Be2 is White's safest option. 7...Ne4! (7...Bxc4? 8.Qa4+ Nc6 9.Bxb4! wins for White) 8.Bxb4 (both 8.Nf3 Nxd2 9.Nbxd2 Bxc4 with equal chances; and 8.a3 Nxd2 9.Nxd2 Bxd2+ 10.Qxd2 Bxc4 offer equal chances; 8.d5? Qc5! 9.Qa4+ Nc6! gives Black a crushing attack) 8...Qxb4+ 9.Nd2 (after 9.Nc3 Nxc3 10.Qd2 Nd5! 11.cxd5 Qxd2+ 12.Kxd2 Bxd5 Black has a small advantage) 9...Bxc4 10.Bxc4 Nxd2 11.Bxf7+! (11.Qxd2 Qxc4 slightly favours Black, C.Lhagvasuren-F.Berend, Moscow Olympiad 1994) 11...Kxf7 12.Qxd2 Re8+ 13.Ne2 Nc6 14.Qxb4 Nxb4 15.Kd2 Re7 with a level endgame.]

**7...Qxb4+ 8.Qd2**

It seems that White will have time to unravel, as Black looks to have been prevented from developing with ...Nc6 on account of a d4-d5 pawn fork. However, we will see that after both this and White's other eighth-move alternatives, the pawn fork is not to be feared. In particular, you will notice the spectacular ...Nxd5 blow appearing again and again. Despite appearances, White's position is on the verge of collapsing. [8.Nc3? Bxc4 is just good for Black; 8.Nd2 is objectively White's best chance, though she is still a long way from escaping the worst: 8...Nc6! 9.d5 (9.Ngf3 O-O-O 10.d5 was the game (Sokolov-Speelman), and here Black could have ended the game immediately with the devastating 10...Nxd5!! 11.cxd5 Bxd5 12.Be2 Bxf3 13.gxf3 Rhe8 , winning) 9...O-O-O! with a powerful attack. For example: 10.Qb3! (not 10.dxc6? Ne4! 11.cxb7+ Kb8 12.Ngf3 Nxd2 13.Nxd2 Rhe8 and wins; while 10.Ngf3? transposes to Sokolov-Speelman, allowing 10...Nxd5!! 11.cxd5 Bxd5 etc; 10.dxe6? Ne4 11.a3 Qxb2! wins) 10...Nxd5 Forcing a draw; (instead 10...Bg4!? 11.f3! Rhe8+ 12.Be2 Bf5 offers dangerous play) 11.cxd5 Bxd5 12.Qxb4 Nxb4 13.O-O-O Nxa2+ 14.Kc2 Nb4+ 15.Kc3 Na2+ with perpetual check.]

**8...Nc6 9.d5**

[Here 9.Nc3? was the game (Kuijf-Hodgson), where 9...Bxc4! was simple and strong; and 9.Qxb4? Nxb4 10.Na3 O-O-O 11.d5 Bf5! will see White getting slaughtered on the central files after ...Rhe8 and ...c7-c6.]

**9...O-O-O! 10.Nc3**

The best chance, although Black is better whatever. [Other moves quickly spell disaster: 10.Nf3? Rhe8 11.Be2 (not 11.Qxb4? Bxd5+ 12.Be2 Bxf3! and wins) 11...Bxd5 12.cxd5 Nxd5 another strong sacrifice on d5. 13.Qxb4 Ncxb4 14.Na3 Nf4 15.Ng1 Re7 16.Kf1 Nxe2 17.Nxe2 Rd2 with a clear advantage to Black.; 10.a3? Qe7! 11.Be2 Nxd5! 12.cxd5 Bxd5 13.Qf4 g5! 14.Qg3 Nd4 and Black wins.; 10.Qxb4? Nxb4 11.Na3 Bf5 is again, crushing.; 10.Be2?! Nxd5!! 11.cxd5 Bxd5 12.f3 Qb6! with a clear advantage. --- After the text, Black has tried six moves with good results, but so far the best continuation remains untested.]

**10...Ne5!!**

[Instead: 10...Bg4!? 11.f3 Rhe8+ 12.Be2 Bf5 13.O-O-O Na5 is Kuijf-Hodgson again.; 10...Na5 11.Nd1 Qa4 12.Nc3 Qb4 led to a quick draw in L.Shytaj-K.Landa, Reggio Emilia 2006/07.]

**11.O-O-O**

[11.b3 c6! demolishes White's centre, to Black's advantage.]

**11...Nxc4 12.Qe2**

Apparently winning a piece thanks to the check on g4, but Black has other ideas.

**12...Bxd5!**

[12...Rxd5 13.Nxd5 Bxd5 14.a3 Nxa3 15.bxa3 Qxa3+ 16.Qb2 Qc5+ 17.Qc2 Qa3+ leads to a draw, but no more than that.]

**13.Nxd5 Rxd5 14.Rxd5 Nxd5 15.Qg4+ Kb8 16.Bxc4**

[Not 16.Qxc4? Qe1+ 17.Kc2 Qxf2+ 18.Kb3 Rd8 with a decisive attack.]

**16...Re8! 17.Nf3 b5! 18.Rd1 Nf6**

Black wins her piece back, keeping a clear advantage.

### (7) Icelandic Gambit - B: 5 Nf3! [B01] [David Smerdon] 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6 4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.Nf3!**

As we have seen, Black can confidently press for an advantage after 5 d4?!, as well as against lesser alternatives. The text is White's main move, and also clearly the best. White delays d2-d4 for the moment, instead opting to bring herself one move closer to kingside castling. --- An indication of the frailty of Black's position is that players have tried no fewer than twelve different moves from the diagram. Of these, we will examine three. We will begin with the most popular try, 5... Nc6, as it is instructive to see why this natural developing move is bad. We will then take a quick look at the extremely rare 5...c5!?, before finally moving on to Black's best move 5...Qe7!. Feel free to skip ahead to this line if you are in a hurry, though again I must stress that taking the time to soak in the ideas from less critical alternatives is a valuable skill.

**5...--**

[5...Nc6 (see variation B1); 5...c5!? (see variation B2); 5...Qe7! (see variation B3)]

### (8) Icelandic Gambit - B1: 5...Nc6 [B01] [David Smerdon] 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6 4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.Nf3 Nc6 6.d4!**

[Other moves have been covered already: 6.Be2 Bc5 via 5 Be2 (where Black's compensation is sufficient); and 6.Nc3?! Qe7! via 5 Nc3?!.]

**6...Bb4+**

[Alternatively, 6...Qe7 7.Qe2! transposes directly to line B3, (whereas 7.Be3 O-O-O 8.Nbd2 g5! is not at all clear, as 9.d5?! Bxd5! 10.cxd5 Nxd5 is dangerous for White.) ]

**7.Nc3!**

Compared with 5 d4?! Bb4+, here the insertion of Nf3 and ...Nc6 is definitely in White's favour. [Instead, the natural 7.Bd2? Qe7 8.Qe2 runs into 8...O-O-O! 9.d5 Rhe8 with a deadly attack, which was examined in the notes to line A (see 7 Qe2? Nc6 8 Nf3 O-O-O! etc).]

**7...Ne4!?**

The best try. [After 7...O-O? 8.d5 Bxd5 9.cxd5 Nxd5 10.Bd2 Re8+ 11.Be2 , Black doesn't have enough for the piece; while 7...Qe7?! 8.Be3! only helps White's development.]

**8.Bd2!**

[8.d5?! Qf6! 9.Bd2 Bxc3 10.bxc3 O-O-O! gives Black the initiative.]

**8...Nxd2**

Without the insertion of Nf3 and ...Nc6, Black can gain the advantage by playing ...Qxd4. Here, that is of course impossible, which makes all the difference.

**9.Qxd2 Bg4 10.Qe3+!**

This check throws out Black's rhythm just in time to prevent the arrival of her rooks in the centre.

**10...Qe7**

A sad necessity. [10...Be7 11.d5 Nb4 12.O-O-O clearly favours White.]

**11.Qxe7+ Bxe7 12.O-O-O O-O-O 13.d5! Bxf3 14.gxf3 Ne5 15.f4**

White has managed to keep her extra pawn, and although converting the win will be problematic, she has all the chances in the endgame.

### (9) Icelandic Gambit - B2: 5...c5!? [B01] [David Smerdon] 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6 4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.Nf3 c5!?**

This move's lack of popularity is understandable, as if anything it seems to limit Black's chances of activity by taking c5 away from her minor pieces. However, Black seeks compensation of a more position nature, aiming to secure the d4-square and with it the permanency of White's backward d-pawn. --- 5...c5 is not a bad move, and certainly better than the most popular continuation 5...Nc6. On the other hand, the position is less dynamic and White has far fewer ways to go wrong than against 5...Nc6 or 5...Qe7. Still, it contains decent surprise value and leads to underexplored positions with plenty of opportunities for the stronger player to outplay her opponent.

**6.Be2**

[6.d4?! is premature. 6...cxd4 7.Nxd4 (7.Qxd4 Nc6! is fine for Black) 7...Bc5! 8.Be3 (8.Nxe6? runs into 8...Bxf2+! 9.Ke2 Qxd1+ 10.Kxd1 fxe6 with an advantage to Black) 8...Ng4 9.Nxe6 Qxd1+ 10.Kxd1 Bxe3 (B.Laurent-V.Okhotnik, Agneaux 2006) 11.Nxg7+ Kf8 12.fxe3 Kxg7 13.Ke1 Re8! and Black has compensation that is 'almost sufficient' for the pawns. White will be left with a slightly more pleasant endgame once e3 drops off, but a draw is still the most likely result.]

**6...Nc6 7.O-O Be7 8.d3**

[8.Nc3 is a more accurate move-order, intending to meet 8...Qc7? with 9.d4! .]

**8...O-O**

[Alternatively: 8...Qb6 9.Nc3 Rd8 10.b3 Bf5 11.Bf4 O-O 12.Qd2? was seen in L.Psakhis-A.Nadanian, Yerevan Olympiad 1996, where Black missed 12...Ne4! 13.Nxe4 Bxe4 , with excellent compensation.; 8...Qc7! is interesting, intending ...Rd8, or if 9.d4 then 9...cxd4 10.Nxd4 O-O-O 11.Nxe6 fxe6 is unclear; ...Nd4 is coming.]

**9.Nc3!**

[Instead, 9.Nbd2?! was Y.Solodovnichenko-F.Bentivegna, Cutro 2008, when Black should play 9...Bf5! 10.Nb3 Qc7! with ...Rad8 to follow; Black is not worse.]

**9...Qd7**

[9...Qb8!? 10.b3 a6 11.Bb2 Rd8 12.Qd2 Ra7!? 13.Nd1 b6 14.Ne3 Nh5 15.g3 Bf6 16.Rad1 Rad7 was the interesting course of a deep engine battle I ran, Houdini 4 Pro-Houdini 4 Pro, Shootout 2014.]

**10.Bf4 Rad8**

After 10...Bd6!? 11.Bg5! Ng4 12.Ne4! White has a pleasant advantage. Stockfish 6-Stockfish 6, Shootout (31 Ply) 2014.<level/>

Black has developed naturally, controlling d4 and keeping White's forces passive. However, White is still a pawn ahead and in no immediate danger. Although Black has done reasonably well in neutralizing White's advantage in practice, objectively her compensation cannot be fully sufficient for the pawn. Play has continued:

11.Re1 Bg4?! (11...Qc8! is better) 12.Ne5! Nxe5 13.Bxe5 Bxe2 14.Qxe2 with a clear advantage to White, D.Stets-K. Zolnierowicz, Nowy Sacz 2005.

11.Qa4 Bg4 12.Rad1 Rfe8 13.Rfe1 Bd6! 14.Be3? (of course, 14.Bxd6 was called for, and after 14...Qxd6 15.h3 Bh5 16.Ng5! White remains on top) 14...Qf5! 15.Nd5? J.K.Shaw-L.Salai, Yerevan Olympiad 1996, and here the aggressive 15...Qh5! would have been very good for Black.; 11.Qd2 Qc8! 12.b3 Bf5 13.Rfd1 (13.Rad1! Ne4 14.Nxe4 Bxe4 15.Ne5! is better for White) 13...Ne4! , when a draw was agreed in K.Sychev-M.Krylov, Moscow 2011, although after 14.Nxe4 Bxe4 15.Ne5! Bd6 16.Nxc6 Bxc6 , White could have kept an edge by returning the pawn with White could have kept a slight advantage by giving back the pawn with 17.b4! .; 11.Ne5! Nxe5 12.Bxe5 Ng4 13.Bf4 Qd4?! (13...Bf6!?) 14.Qd2?! (here 14.Bxg4! Qxf4 15.Bxe6 fxe6 16.Qe2 gives White a clear advantage) 14...Bd6 15.Bxd6 Qxd6 16.Bxg4 Bxg4 17.Qg5 and White had a small but stable advantage, R.Skytte-R.Sluka, Olomouc 2006.

### (10) Icelandic Gambit - B3: 5...Qe7! [B01] [David Smerdon] 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6 4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.Nf3 Qe7!**

The modern way to play the Icelandic Gambit. Black figures that the awkwardness of the mutual queen interpositioning is felt worse by White, who will now have to give up hopes of kingside castling in order to keep her extra pawn. On the other hand, the immobilization of Black's dark-squared bishop is no less significant, as d4 can no longer be met by ...Bb4+.

**6.Qe2**

[6.Be2?! Bxc4 , as in C. Sandipan-D.Smerdon, World Junior Championships, Goa 2002 (and many other games) , shouldn't worry Black at all.]

**6...Nc6**

[The unplayed 6...c5!? is worthy of attention, but after 7.d4! (7.Nc3?! Nc6 8.d3 Rd8 with sufficient compensation due to White's weaknesses on d3 and d4) 7...cxd4 8.Nxd4 Nc6! 9.Nxe6 (9.Nxc6 bxc6 10.Nc3 O-O-O is less clear) 9...fxe6 10.Be3 , White should slowly unravel, leaving her a sound pawn to the good.]

**7.d4**

A key tabiya for the success of Iceland's finest contribution to opening theory. Black has three plausible continuations. The most aggressive option, 7. ..O-O-O?, simply doesn't work, although it is good fun and I have tried it myself from time to time. 7...Bg4 is considered Black's best option in most theoretical texts, but the rare 7...Bf5! is definitely the pick of the bunch.

**7...--**

[7...O-O-O? (see variation B31); 7...Bg4 (see variation B32); 7...Bf5! (see variation B33)]

### (11) Icelandic Gambit - B31: 7...O-O-O? [B01] [David Smerdon] 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6 4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.Nf3 Qe7 6.Qe2 Nc6 7.d4 O-O-O? 8.d5 Qb4+**

[The novelty 8...Nxd5! is better, but the careful 9.cxd5 Bxd5 10.Qxe7 Bxe7 11.Nc3! Nb4 12.Nxd5 Rxd5 13.Rb1! still gives White a winning game.]

**9.Nc3 Bf5**

Unfortunately for Black, the piece can safely be captured, though White does need to find a couple more accurate moves to avoid the tricks.

**10.dxc6!**

[10.a3?! can be met by 10...Qa5 (rather than 10...Qb3?! 11.dxc6 Bc5 12.cxb7+ Qxb7 13.Nd5! and White has a won game, L. Webb-D.Smerdon, British League 2013.) ]

**10...Bc5 11.a3! Qb6 12.Be3 Rhe8**

[Or if 12...Bxe3 13.fxe3 Bd3 , as in J.Sveinsson-P.Corbat, correspondence 2000, then 14.Na4! Qxc6 15.Ne5 wins.]

**13.Rd1! Bxe3 14.fxe3 Rxe3 15.cxb7+ Kxb7 16.Rxd8 Rxe2+ 17.Bxe2 Qxb2 18.Nd1! Qxa3 19.O-O**

White has an overwhelming material advantage.

### (12) Icelandic Gambit - B32: 7...Bg4 [B01] [David Smerdon] 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6 4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.Nf3 Qe7 6.Qe2 Nc6 7.d4 Bg4**

This move offers Black reasonable chances and can be difficult to meet in practice, as White does not find relief after an immediate exchange of queens.

**8.Be3**

[8.Qxe7+?! Bxe7 9.Be3 O-O-O 10.Nbd2 Nb4 11.Kd1 Bf5! gives Black ongoing pressure for the pawn; while after 8.d5?! Bxf3 9.gxf3 Nd4 10.Qxe7+ Bxe7 , Black regains her pawn with a slightly more pleasant endgame.]

**8...O-O-O 9.d5 Ne5 10.Nc3 Nfd7**

[10...Qb4 is popular, but the queen can't really cause too much damage by herself. For example, 11.O-O-O Qa5 (11...Bh5 allows White to launch a surprising offensive with 12.Bxa7! Nxf3 13.gxf3 b6 14.c5!! Bxc5 15.Qa6+ Kd7 16.Bc4! with a decisive attack) 12.h3 Bxf3 13.gxf3 Bb4 14.Bd4 was clearly better for White in C.Koepke-R.Tleptsok, Helsingor 2014.]

**11.O-O-O!**

[11.h3?! was played against me in one of my first outings for our system. Indulge me while I show off the cute finish: 11...Nxf3+ 12.gxf3 Bh5 13.O-O-O Ne5 14.Bg2 Qb4 15.Rd4 Bc5 16.Rh4?! Bxe3+ 17.Qxe3 Rhe8! (Black's attack is raging) 18.Rxh5 Nxc4 19.Qd4 c5 20.Qg4+ Rd7 21.Nd1? Re2 22.Qf4 Na3!! 23.Qf5 (or 23.Qxb4 Rc2#) 23...Qd2# , S. Kosmo-D.Smerdon, World Junior Championships, Goa 2002.]

**11...Qf6 12.h3 Bxf3**

[12...Bh5 13.g4 Nxf3 14.gxh5 is worse, and 14...Re8? 15.d6! Bxd6 16.h4! was a disaster for Black in D.Lamson-D.Ray, correspondence 2010.]

**13.gxf3 Qxf3 14.Qxf3 Nxf3 15.Be2 Nfe5 16.Rhg1**

This is the best Black can hope for if White manages to avoid the tricks and find all the right moves. The endgame is clearly better for White, though Black has an active knight and play on the dark squares, so there remain drawing chances. From a practical perspective, it's up to you in each game to decide whether the probability of your opponent falling for one of the traps before reaching this position can justify you choosing to employ this dubious line.

### (13) Icelandic Gambit - B33: 7...Bf5! [B01] [David Smerdon] 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6 4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.Nf3 Qe7 6.Qe2 Nc6 7.d4 Bf5!**

An extremely rare move in practice, but it offers Black the best chances. I had been waiting for several years for an opponent to allow me to unleash my analysis on this move, when my attention was brought to a 2008 article by Michiel Wind in the German magazine Kaissiber. His excellent analysis supported my conclusions about 7...Bf5, and yet this line is still played only infrequently today - perhaps because Wind's article was never translated into English. In any case, there seems little doubt that the Icelandic Gambit's reputation depends on the evaluation of the lines that follows this move. --- As compared to 7...Bg4, White no longer has time to develop with Be3. On the other hand, the exchange of queens is now more favourable for White, which she can initiate immediately or after further preparation.

**8.Qxe7+**

Instead: 8.Be3? Nb4! would be a colossal error.;

8.a3!? is perhaps the most accurate move. 8...Na5! (now 8...O-O-O 9.Qxe7 Bxe7 transposes to 9...O-O-O below, so Black should prefer 8...Na5! attempting to reach the main line) 9.Nbd2 c5 10.b4 (10.d5 leaves Black without any more decent waiting moves, hence 10...O-O-O 11.Qxe7 Bxe7 12.Be2 Rhe8 13.O-O b5! 14.b3 Bf8! 15.Re1 Bc2 with full compensation for the pawn - analysis courtesy of IM Guy West; 10.Qe3!? is an independent try, though after 10...O-O-O 11.Be2 Qc7! , White may rue not exchanging queens when she had the chance) 10...cxb4 11.c5 Nd5! with a complex position. For example, 12.axb4 Nc6 13.Nc4 Qxe2+ 14.Bxe2 Ndxb4 15.Ne3 Nd3+ 16.Bxd3 Bxd3 17.Bb2 f6 18.Ba3 Na5! and Black's superior minor pieces compensate for White's strong central pawns.<skip start="9...O-O-O"/>

**8...Bxe7**

Black's compensation in the endgame lies in her superior development. Her minor pieces are already mobilized and she is ready to launch active operations against the white position. The vulnerable light-squared weaknesses in the white queenside (namely c2, and potentially b3 if White plays a2-a3) are attractive targets, while her extra pawn on d4 will quickly come under attack. However, it is important to remember that these advantages are largely temporary in nature, so Black must strive to play energetically to make use of these trumps before White has time to consolidate. If Black does so, she will discover that her compensation is worth at least a pawn, even without the queens on the board.

**9.a3**

[We looked at 9.Be3 Nb4 10.Na3 in the game (Pruess-Gareyev), where 10...O-O! 11.Be2 (or 11.h3 c6) 11...Ng4! would have given Black decent play after securing the bishop pair.]

**9...Na5!**

A fine suggestion by Michiel Wind. Black embarks on a quick assault against White's centre before White is able to complete her development. [9...O-O-O is more popular, but Black doesn't have time for this natural move. After 10.Be3 Rhe8 11.Nc3 Bf8 12.Be2 , White has a clear advantage.]

**10.Nbd2 c5! 11.Be2!**

[Instead: 11.dxc5?! (Wind considered this to be the best reply, but in fact White already needs to think about trying to equalize) 11...O-O-O 12.b4?! Wind's main line (after the superior 12.Be2 Rhe8 13.O-O Bxc5 14.Bd1 Nc6 15.b4 Bd4! Black retains good chances with excellent compensation for the pawn - Wind) 12...Rhe8 13.Be2 Nh5! 14.g3 (not 14.bxa5? Nf4 15.Nb3 Nxg2+ 16.Kf1 Bh3 17.Nfd4 Bxc5 18.Bg4+ Bxg4 19.Kxg2 Bxd4 20.Nxd4 Rxd4 and Black has a crushing advantage, Cl.Dubois-R.Tleptsok, correspondence 2009) 14...Bf6 15.Ra2 Bd3 16.Ng1 Nc6 17.f3 Bc3 gives Black a completely dominant position, worth far more than White's two-pawn advantage (analysis based on Wind).; 11.b4 cxb4 12.c5 (after 12.axb4 , either 12...Bxb4 (or 12...Nc6! gives equal chances) ) 12...O-O 13.axb4 Nc6 14.Bc4 Nxb4 15.O-O b6 with equality.; 11.d5 invites Black to transpose to the 8 a3 Na5 9 Nbd2 c5 10 d5 line above with 11...O-O-O (but even better is 11...O-O 12.Be2 b5! which favours Black; White will soon face problems with her underdeveloped queenside.) ]

**11...O-O-O 12.O-O cxd4**

Here, Wind ends his analysis, claiming equality. From a practical point of view this is also a good point to finish memorizing your theory. It should be noted, however, that Black is still a little way off from achieving a fully equal game. Although Black has regained the pawn, her d-pawn is more of a weakness than a strength, and White can begin to mass her forces around it while pushing forward on the queenside. Black needs to play accurately to maintain the balance, so let's dig deeper:

**13.Re1**

[13.b4 d3! kicks White's bishop to a less comfortable square: 14.Bd1 Nc6 15.Bb2 Rhe8 16.Re1 Bd6 with balanced chances.]

**13...d3 14.Bf1 Nc6 15.b4 Nh5! 16.Bb2 Bf6 17.Bxf6 Nxf6 18.c5!**

Securing the d6-square and preparing a future Nc4.

**18...Kb8!**

A high-class waiting move, anticipating a knight landing on d6 in the future. [After 18...Rhe8?! 19.Rxe8 Nxe8 20.Nc4 Kc7 21.Rd1 , the d-pawn will soon fall.]

**19.Nc4**

[Or 19.Rad1 a5! (now that the rook has left the queenside, Black immediately begins to soften up White's pawns on that side of the board) 20.Nc4 axb4 21.axb4 Rhe8! 22.Nd6 Rxe1 23.Nxe1 Bg6 24.Bxd3 Nxb4 25.Bxg6 fxg6 26.Rb1 Nfd5! and Black has everything covered.]

**19...Nd4! 20.Rad1 Rhe8 21.Rxe8 Nxf3+ 22.gxf3 Nxe8 23.Ne5 a5!**

White has managed to round up the d-pawn, but Black's activity and superior structure mean she is in no danger. The game should end in a draw.

### (14) Icelandic Gambit [B01] [John Emms] 

More adventurous Black players may be attracted to the speculative Icelandic Gambit which arises after

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6**

. After

**4.dxe6 Bxe6**

we have a gambit in the truest form: Black has some compensation for the pawn, but a lot of water has to pass under the bridge before we can safely come to an assessment (see Chapter 10).

### (15) Chapter 10: 2...Nf6 - Icelandic Gambit [B01] [John Emms] 

The imaginative Icelandic Gambit came to prominence in the late 1980s, when the young Icelandic players (now GMs) Hannes Stefansson and Throstur Thorhallsson utilized it with some success. Black's concept is quite simple: a pawn is sacrificed in order to open lines and to develop quickly and effectively. Black will often castle long, park the rooks in the centre and then try to create annoying threats as soon as possible. It is important for Black to do this, because if White consolidates, Black can just wind up a clear central pawn down. Frequently Black must be prepared to sacrifice further material in the quest to hunt down the white king while it remains in the centre. Needless to say, White has to tread very carefully throughout the opening stages in order to emerge unscathed. --- From a theoretical standpoint White should be able to keep an advantage. Somehow, the Icelandic Gambit just looks as though it should not quite work for Black. Nevertheless, while it no longer carries the same surprise punch, Black's practical results since the first edition have still been very good (as high as 50%). --- Let's look at the first few moves:

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6 4.dxe6**

[4.d4?! exd5 5.Nc3 Bb4! hands Black a good version of the Exchange French. Black can develop freely and has no problems whatsoever.]

**4...Bxe6 5.Nf3**

[5.d4 is an important alternative (see Games 70-72), but it does provide Black with more attacking options. 5 Nf3 is generally considered as the critical test of the Icelandic.]

**5...Qe7!**

[Not much has changed in the line 5...Nc6 6.d4 Bb4+ 7.Nc3! Ne4 8.Bd2 since the first edition, my assessment being that Black doesn't have enough play for the pawn. The main continuations are the following: 8...-- a) 8...Nxd2 9.Qxd2 Qe7 10.O-O-O O-O (or 10...O-O-O 11.d5 Bg4 12.Re1) 11.a3 Na5 12.Kb1 Bf5+ 13.Ka2 Bxc3 14.Qxc3 b6 15.Bd3 and White has consolidated his extra pawn, Dolmatov-Boissonnet, Buenos Aires 1991.; b) 8...Bxc3!? 9.bxc3 Qe7 10.Be3! (10.Qe2 Bg4! 11.O-O-O Qa3+ 12.Kb1 Ne7! is much less clear) 10...Bg4 (or 10...O-O-O 11.d5 Bg4 12.Bd3 Nc5 13.Be2 Rhe8 14.O-O with a good extra pawn, Ma.Adams-Morin, correspondence 2002) 11.Bd3 O-O-O (11...Nxc3 12.Qc2! Qa3 13.Bc1 Qe7+ 14.Kf1!) 12.Qc2 Bxf3 13.gxf3 Ng5 14.Be2 and Black has insufficient compensation, Oral-Sikora Lerch, Slovakia 1997.; ]

**6.Qe2!**

[Returning the pawn with 6.Be2?! Bxc4 gives Black no problems at all; for example 7.d3 Be6 (7...Ba6 8.O-O Nc6 and ...O-O-O is also okay) 8.O-O Nc6 9.Nc3 O-O-O 10.a3 Nd5 , Danin-Alekseev, Nizhnij Novgorod 1999.]

**6...Nc6 7.d4 --**

Now Black has two main choices: [7...O-O-O (Game 68); and 7...Bg4 (Game 69).; After 7...Bf5 8.Qxe7+ Bxe7 9.a3! O-O-O 10.Be3 Black finds it very difficult to exploit his lead in development.]

### (16) Morin,S. - Corbat,P. [B01] Correspondence (Game 68), 2002 [John Emms] 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6 4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.Nf3 Qe7 6.Qe2 Nc6 7.d4 O-O-O**

This is the move Black would most like to play, but the question remains, is it really playable?

**8.d5 Qb4+ 9.Nc3 Bf5 10.dxc6**

[10.Be3 is another move, but as far as I can see, this only gives Black extra options. Why not capture on c6?]

**10...Bc5**

[10...Ne4!? worked well in the game D.Ledger-Conlon, Scarborough 2001, after 11.a3 Qa5 12.cxb7+ Kb8 13.Bd2 Nxd2 14.Nxd2 Bb4 15.Rc1 Rhe8 16.axb4 Qxb4 , but White has many improvements in this line, the main one being 15 Nd5!.]

**11.cxb7+**

[Another idea for White is to delay capturing on b7 by playing 11.Be3 , so that after 11...Bd3 there is the extra option of 12.a3 . Now one possible line is 12...Qb6 13.Bxc5 Qxc5 14.cxb7+ Kb8 15.Qxd3 Rhe8+ 16.Qe2 Ng4 17.Nd1 Rxd1+ 18.Kxd1 Nxf2+ 19.Kc2 Rxe2+ 20.Bxe2 Nxh1 21.Rxh1 with a clear advantage for White.]

**11...Kxb7**

[However, 11...Kb8 presents new problems; for example, 12.Be3 Bd3 13.Ne5! and suddenly Black is hit by the threat of Nc6+.; Perhaps Black should play 11...Qxb7!? ; for example, 12.Be3 Bd3 13.Qxd3 Rxd3 14.Bxd3 Bxe3! (14...Qxb2 15.Bf5+ Nd7 16.O-O! Bxe3 17.Ne4 Bf4 18.Rad1 Rd8 19.Nc5) 15.Bf5+ Kd8 16.Rd1+ Ke7 17.fxe3 Qxb2 18.Ne2 when White has rook, bishop and knight against the queen, but he still has one or two coordination problems.]

**12.Be3!**

Now this is very strong.

**12...Bxe3**

Instead: [a) 12...Bd3 13.Qxd3 Rxd3 14.Bxd3 Bxe3 15.fxe3 transposes to the main game.; b) 12...Rhe8 13.Rd1! Rc8 (Ma.Adams-Partington, British League 2000) is not the most desirable move for Black to play; (but 13...Bxe3 14.fxe3 Rxd1+ 15.Kxd1 Ng4 16.e4; and 13...Ne4 14.Rxd8 Rxd8 15.a3 Qa5 16.Bxc5 Nxc3 17.Bb4 are both winning for White) 14.h3 is perhaps White's best bet, planning g2-g4 and Bg2. I don't see a good way for Black to continue here; e. g. 14...Ne4 15.a3 Qa5 16.Nd4! Nxc3 17.Nb3! Nxe2+ 18.Nxa5+ Ka6 19.Kxe2 Bxe3 20.fxe3 Kxa5 21.Rd5+ and White wins.]

**13.fxe3 Bd3 14.Qxd3! Rxd3 15.Bxd3**

Crucially, Black cannot capture on b2 because of Rb1. White is able to castle and consolidate his material advantage.

**15...Ng4 16.O-O Nxe3 17.a3 Qb6 18.Be4+ c6 19.Na4 Qa5 20.Rfe1 Nxg2 21.Kxg2 Qxa4 22.b3 Qa5 23.Ne5 Qd2+ 24.Kh1 Rc8 25.b4 1-0**

### (17) Kosmo,S. - Smerdon,D. [B01] World Junior Ch., Goa (Game 69), 2002 [John Emms] 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6 4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.Nf3 Qe7 6.Qe2 Nc6 7.d4 Bg4**

The main alternative to 7...O-O-O. At least this way Black doesn't lose apiece!

**8.Be3**

[White can also take the opportunity to trade queens with 8.Qxe7+!? Bxe7 9.Be3 O-O-O and now: 10.-- a) 10.d5 Nb4 11.Na3 (11.Nd4? c5! 12.dxc6 Rxd4 13.Bxd4 Nc2+ 14.Kd2 Nxd4 is good for Black) 11...c6 12.Be2 cxd5 13.O-O (Frois-Almeida, Almada 1988) and here 13...Bxf3 14.Bxf3 d4 (M�ller) seems fine for Black; b) 10.Nbd2!? Nb4 11.Kd1 (now Black must be quick as White is threatening to consolidate with a2-a3 and Kc2) 11...Bf5 12.a3 (12.Rc1!?) 12...Nc2 13.Rc1 Nxe3+ 14.fxe3 Ng4 15.Ke2 Rhe8 with some pressure for the pawn, Koban-Mittelsteiner, Graz 1995. How Black fares here could prove crucial to the overall assessment of the Icelandic Gambit.; ]

**8...O-O-O 9.d5 Ne5**

[9...Qb4+ merely helps White to develop: 10.Nc3 Ne5 11.O-O-O Nxf3 12.gxf3 Bf5 13.Qd2 a6 14.Bd4 Nd7 15.Bd3 and Black has no compensation, Asperen-Noire, correspondence 1999.; 9...Ne4!? is a crazy move that is very close to working. The critical move must be 10.dxc6 (10.Nc3? Nxc3 11.bxc3 Qf6 12.Qb2 Bxf3 13.gxf3 Ne5 , A. Hunt-Conlon, Scarborough 2001, didn't test the idea.; but 10.Nbd2 is another possibility.) 10...Qb4+ 11.Nbd2 Qxb2 12.Rb1 Qxb1+! 13.Nxb1 Bb4+ . In the days before computers, an annotator could get away with saying 'with play for the queen!' Fritz continues 14.Bd2 Nxd2 15.Nbxd2 Bxf3 16.Qxf3 Rxd2 17.cxb7+ Kb8 18.a3 Ba5 19.Be2 Rd3+ 20.Kf1 Rxf3 21.Bxf3 and White's better.]

**10.Nc3 Nfd7!**

Planning ...Qf6. Is this the positional way of playing the Icelandic?

**11.h3**

[A demonstration of Black's chances in this position is seen in the game Hergert-Leisebein, correspondence 1996, which continued 11.O-O-O Qf6 12.Ne4 Qa6 13.Kb1 Re8 14.h3 Bh5 15.Ng3 Bg6+ 16.Ka1 Nxf3 17.Qxf3 Bc2 and here White decided to give up the exchange , but following 18.c5 (18.Rc1?? loses to 18...Bb3 19.a3 Bxa3!; 18.Rd2 is better, but 18...Bb3 19.a3 Bb4 still leaves White in somewhat of a fix. 20.Re2) 18...Bxd1 19.Qxd1 Qa5 20.c6 Nb6 he was clearly worse.]

**11...Nxf3+ 12.gxf3 Bh5 13.O-O-O Ne5?!**

[Black should probably opt for something less ambitious like 13...Qf6 14.Bg2 Re8 , when he has good positional compensation in the form of active pieces and structural superiority.]

**14.Bg2 Qb4 15.Rd4?!**

This rook manoeuvre doesn't do White any favours. [Andrew Martin suggests 15.Bxa7 Nxc4 16.Rd4 , which does look good for White; while 15.c5 is also promising.]

**15...Bc5 16.Rh4 Bxe3+?!**

[16...Bg6! is stronger, meeting 17.Bxc5 Qxc5 18.Qxe5? with 18...Qxf2! hitting c2 and h4.]

**17.Qxe3?!**

Missing the strength of Black's next move. [17.fxe3! must be better.]

**17...Rhe8! 18.Rxh5 Nxc4 19.Qd4?**

[Following 19.Qd3! Qxb2+ 20.Kd1 it's not clear whether Black has anything better than a perpetual check with 20...Qa1+ 21.Kc2 Qb2+ 22.Kd1 Qa1+ .]

**19...c5! 20.Qg4+ Rd7 21.Nd1?**

[21.Kd1 is more resilient, although 21...b5! still leaves White is a lot of trouble.]

**21...Re2! 22.Qf4 Na3! 23.Qf5 Qd2# 0-1**

### (18) Kuijf,M. - Hodgson,J. [B01] Wijk aan Zee (Game 70), 1989 [John Emms] 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6 4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.d4 Bb4+**

The only natural continuation.

**6.Bd2 Qe7**

Black continues to develop with threats. [6...Bxd2+ is studied in Game 71.]

**7.Bxb4**

White has two serious alternatives: [a) 7.Qe2 Nc6 8.Nf3 O-O-O! 9.d5 Rhe8 (Anderson) sees a typical lining up of Black's major pieces in the centre. Black seems to be better in all lines: 10.-- a) 10.dxc6 Qc5 11.cxb7+ Kb8 12.Nc3 Bxc4 13.Be3 Bxe2 14.Bxc5 Bxf3+ 15.Be3 Bxb7 , restoring material equality with an advantage of a huge lead in development.; b) 10.Nc3 Bxc3 11.Bxc3 Nxd5 12.cxd5 Bxd5 13.Qxe7 Rxe7+ 14.Be2 Bxf3 15.gxf3 Rde8 and Black regains the piece with a clear plus.; c) 10.dxe6 Qc5 11.Nc3 (11.g3 Qf5!) 11...Rxd2! 12.Qxd2 Rxe6+ 13.Kd1! (13.Be2 Ne4 14.Qc2 Qxf2+ 15.Kd1 Bxc3 16.bxc3 Qe3 17.Ke1 Nxc3 18.Qd2 (18.Kf1 Ne4! - Anderson) 18...Qxe2+ 19.Qxe2 Rxe2+ 20.Kf1 Nb4 and Black is in control.) 13...Bxc3 14.Qxc3 Ne4 15.Qxg7 Nxf2+ 16.Kc1 Qe3+ 17.Kb1 Qe4+ 18.Kc1 Rd6 19.b3 Nxh1 20.Kb2 Nf2 and Black, having regained his material, still has the initiative.; ; b) 7.Be2! . Play continues: 7...Nc6 (the tempting 7...Bxc4 falls short after 8.Qa4+ Nc6 9.Bxb4 Qxb4+ 10.Qxb4 Nxb4 11.Bxc4 Nc2+ 12.Kd1 Nxa1 13.Nc3 , when White will pick up the knight on a1 with a distinct advantage) 8.d5 Nxd5!? 9.cxd5 Bxd5 10.Kf1 O-O-O and it's clear Black has reasonable compensation, but the few games played from this position have been unable to produce any solid conclusions. One practical example went 11.Nc3 Bxc3 12.bxc3 Be4 13.Nf3 Ne5 14.Nxe5 Qxe5 15.f3 Bf5 16.Qe1 Rhe8 17.Bg5 f6 18.Bh4 Qd5 19.c4 Qd4 20.Bf2 Rxe2 21.Bxd4 Rxe1+ 22.Rxe1 Rxd4 23.Kf2 Rxc4 (Corbat-Carothers, correspondence 2001) and I prefer Black here, but of course there may well be a few improvements down this long and complex line.]

**7...Qxb4+ 8.Qd2**

[Anderson points out that 8.Nd2!? is a serious consideration here. A reply in keeping with the Icelandic spirit is More in keeping with the Icelandic spirit is 8...Nc6!? (another option here is simply to regain the pawn with 8...Qxb2 ; following 9.Ngf3 Bf5! 10.Be2 Nc6 11.d5 Nd4 Black has no real problems) 9.d5 O-O-O 10.-- and now:a) 10.dxe6 Rhe8!; b) 10.Ngf3 Nxd5! 11.cxd5 Bxd5 12.Be2 Bxf3! 13.gxf3 Rhe8 14.a3 Qf4 with a winning position for Black (Anderson).; c) 10.dxc6 Rhe8 11.Be2 Ne4! 12.Ngf3 Bxc4 (Anderson ) and again White is in trouble.; d) 10.a3!? may well be the most challenging move, as Black must commit his queen. 10...Qxb2 (However, 10...Qb6!? 11.dxe6 Rhe8 still looks very promising for Black.) 11.Rb1 Qe5+ (11...Qa2 12.Qb3 Qxb3 13.Rxb3 Nxd5 14.cxd5 Bxd5) 12.Be2 Nd4 13.dxe6 Ne4 14.Nxe4 Qxe4 15.Rb2 Nf3+ 16.Nxf3 Rxd1+ 17.Kxd1 Rd8+ 18.Kc1 Qxe6 probably favours White.; ]

**8...Nc6**

[8...Qe7 transposes to Game 71.]

**9.d5**

The most critical move. Alternatives are less testing: [a) 9.Nf3 O-O-O 10.d5 Rhe8 11.Be2 Bg4!; b) 9.Qxb4 Nxb4 10.Na3 O-O-O 11.d5 Bf5 and Black will open up the centre with ...c7-c6.; c) Surrendering the c-pawn with 9.Nc3?! Bxc4! leaves White scrambling for equality. Doghri-Galego, Algarve 1995 continued 10.Bxc4 Qxc4 11.Qe3+ Kf8 12.O-O-O Nb4 13.Kb1 Nfd5 14.Qd2 Nxc3+ 15.bxc3 Nd5 16.Kb2 Re8 17.Re1 Rxe1 18.Qxe1 h5! and Black can introduce his rook via h6. There may well be improvements for White, but in general this line looks good for Black.]

**9...O-O-O 10.Nc3**

[10.a3?! Qe7! 11.Be2 Nxd5 12.cxd5 Bxd5 leaves White in some trouble; while 10.Bd3?! Rhe8 11.Ne2 Ne5! is also favourable for Black.]

**10...Bg4 11.f3**

[11.h3!? , trying to push the bishop back without weakening f3, has also been played. Play continues 11...Rhe8+ 12.Nge2 and now: (not 12.Be2? Bxe2 13.Ngxe2 Qxc4 14.O-O Nxd5 which is virtually winning for Black) 12...-- a) 12...Bxe2 13.Bxe2 Qxc4 14.O-O is unclear. Note that 14...Qd4 15.Qg5! Nxd5? fails to 16.Rad1 Qe5 17.Bg4+! Kb8 18.Qxe5 Rxe5 19.f4!; b) 12...Bh5!? looks reasonable; e.g. 13.O-O-O Na5 14.b3 c6! with compensation.; c) 12...Qxc4!? 13.hxg4 Nxd5 with a further branch: 14.-- c1) 14.O-O-O Ndb4 15.Nd4 (not 15.Qg5? Nxa2+ 16.Kb1 Rxd1+ 17.Nxd1 Qd3+! 18.Kxa2 Nb4+ 19.Ka1 Re6 and White gets mated) 15...Qc5 16.Rh5 Qf8 17.Ncb5 Nxd4 18.Nxd4 Re4 (M�ller) and Black regains his piece to leave a roughly level position.; c2) 14.Nxd5 Rxd5 15.Qc3 Qxg4 with a typically unclear position, Newerovski-Rodin, Smolensk 2000.; ; ]

**11...Rhe8+ 12.Be2 Bf5 13.O-O-O Na5 14.g4**

White must be very careful not to fall for a trick here: [a) 14.Nb5? Rxe2! 15.Nxe2 Qxc4+ 16.Nbc3 Qxa2! and Black wins.; b) 14.b3!? c6 15.Bd3 Bxd3 16.Qxd3 cxd5 (16...b5!?) 17.Nxd5 (Ewin-Weiland, Frankfurt 2000) 17...Nxd5 18.cxd5 Re5 and here 19.Ne2 Nxb3+! 20.axb3 Rexd5 21.Qxd5 Qa3+ 22.Kc2 Qa2+ 23.Kc3 Rxd5 24.Rxd5 Qxe2 gives Black any advantage that's going.; c) 14.Qf4 Bg6 15.Rd4 Nh5 16.Qd2 c5 17.dxc6 (Ahlberg-Richter, Bad W�rishofen 1992) 17...Nxc6 18.Rxd8+ Rxd8 gives Black good play.]

**14...Bg6 15.Nh3?**

[15.b3 is stronger, although after 15...c6 16.Bd3 Bxd3 17.Qxd3 Black can keep the pressure on with 17...b5! (Anderson).]

**15...Nd7!?**

This leads to a fantastic finish to the game, [but objectively better is 15...Nxc4! 16.Bxc4 Qxc4 , when Black's active pieces and White's weak d5-pawn ensure Black a clear advantage.]

**16.Nb1??**

[White can hang on with 16.Ne4! ; e.g. 16...Qa4 17.b3 Qa3+ 18.Qb2 Qxb2+ 19.Kxb2 Bxe4 20.fxe4 Rxe4 21.Rhe1 Rde8 22.Ng1 (Anderson).]

**16...Qb3!!**

Very visual, as well as being extremely effective.

**17.Bd3**

[17.axb3 fails to 17...Nxb3#; Or 17.Nc3 Qxa2!!]

**17...Qxa2**

The critical a-pawn drops.

**18.Qb4 Re2!**

White's bishop on d3 is overloaded, so he must give up the queen.

**19.Bxe2 Nb3+ 20.Qxb3 Qxb3 21.Rd2 Qe3 0-1**

### (19) Martin del Campo,R. - Thorhallsson,T. [B01] Baguio City (Game 71), 1987 [John Emms] 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6 4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.d4 Bb4+ 6.Bd2 Bxd2+**

A simpler move than 6...Qe7, giving White fewer options.

**7.Qxd2 Qe7 8.Qe3**

[8.Qe2? Nc6 already leaves White in big trouble; e.g. 9.Nf3 (9.d5 Nd4) 9...O-O-O 10.d5 Rhe8! 11.Nc3 Bxd5! 12.cxd5 Qb4 13.dxc6 Qxb2 and Black wins.]

**8...Nc6**

[After 8...Ng4 White should play 9.Qa3! , after which 9...Qf6 10.Nf3 Nc6 11.Qc3! looks better for him.]

**9.Nf3?**

Option 'b' seems to be White's best here: [a) 9.d5 Ng4 (9...Nb4 10.Na3 Ng4 11.Qe2 O-O-O 12.h3 Nxd5) 10.Qe4 (10.Qc3? Bxd5+ 11.Ne2 Be6 12.Qxg7 O-O-O and Black's lead in development is overwhelming.) 10...O-O-O is promising for Black; for example, 11.Be2 (or 11.Nc3 Rhe8 12.dxe6 Qb4) 11...Qb4+ 12.Nd2 Rhe8 13.Ngf3 Bd7; b) 9.Be2! and now: 9...-- a) 9...O-O-O 10.d5 Rhe8 11.dxc6 Qb4+ 12.Qc3! and Black's attack is insufficient.; b) 9...Qb4+ 10.Nc3 O-O-O 11.d5 Bxd5!? (11...Rhe8 12.dxc6 b6 13.c5 Bc4 14.a3 Qb3 15.Qc1 Ne4 16.Nxe4 Rxe4 17.f3 Re5 18.Kf2 and I can't find anything for Black in this position; 11...Nxd5 12.cxd5 Bxd5 is unclear) 12.cxd5 Nxd5 13.Qc1 Rhe8 with another position that is difficult to assess. Black only has a pawn for his piece and there are no immediate threats, but White has still got a lot of work to do before he consolidates.; c) 9...Ng4!? (paradoxically allowing an exchange of queens, but this may be best) 10.Bxg4 Bxg4 11.Qxe7+ Kxe7 12.f3 Bf5 13.Ne2 Rad8 (Hendriks-Galego, Sas van Gent 1994) and I believe that Black has enough for the pawn; e.g. 14.d5 Nb4 15.Na3 (or 15.Nd4 Bg6 16.O-O c5!) 15...c6! 16.dxc6 bxc6; ]

**9...Ng4! 10.Qe2?**

[10.Qe4 O-O-O 11.Be2 Qf6! 12.O-O Nxd4 13.Nxd4 Rxd4 is obviously nice for Black.; White's best chance here is 10.Qg5! Qxg5 (10...f6 11.Qc5) 11.Nxg5 Nxd4 12.Nxe6 Nxe6 (M�ller) and Black has a slight edge.]

**10...O-O-O 11.d5 Rhe8!**

The usual scenario, and a very favourable one from Black's point of view!

**12.Nc3 Bxd5! 13.O-O-O**

[After 13.cxd5 Qb4 14.dxc6 Qxb2! White can resign.]

**13...Bxf3 14.Qxf3**

[Or 14.Qxe7 Rxe7 15.gxf3 Nxf2 16.Rxd8+ Kxd8 17.Rg1 Nd4! .]

**14...Rxd1+ 15.Nxd1 Qg5+ 16.Kb1 Re1 17.g3 Nd4 18.Qd3 Qg6! 0-1**

### (20) Thirion,M. - Berend,F. [B01] Eupen (Game 72), 1995 [John Emms] 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6 4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.d4 Bb4+ 6.Nc3?!**

Not to be recommended!

**6...Ne4! 7.Qd3**

Alternatively: [a) 7.a3 Nxc3 8.Qd2 (or 8.Qd3 Qe7! 9.axb4 Bxc4+ 10.Qe3 Bxf1 11.Qxe7+ Kxe7 12.Kxf1 Nd5 and White has a miserable ending) 8...Qe7 9.bxc3 Bxc4+ 10.Ne2 Ba5 and White has real problems completing his development.; b) After 7.Qc2 Black's simplest is 7...Nxc3! 8.bxc3 Qxd4! 9.Bb2 Qe5+ 10.Be2 Bc5 with a clear advantage.]

**7...Bf5 8.Qe3?**

Only with the Icelandic Gambit can White be so lost after only eight moves! Option 'c' looks like White's best chance: [a) 8.Nge2 Nc6! 9.a3 (9.Qe3 O-O) 9...Nxc3 10.Qxf5 Nxe2+ 11.axb4 Nxc1 12.Rxc1 Qe7+ 13.Kd1 Nxd4 is very unpleasant for White.; b) 8.Qf3 Qxd4! 9.Nge2 (or 9.Qxf5 Bxc3+ 10.bxc3 Qxc3+ 11.Ke2 O-O 12.Qxe4 Nc6 and White's survival chances are slim) 9...Qf6 and Black, having regained his pawn, stands better.; c) 8.a3! Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 O-O 10.Qf3 Re8 11.Be2 Qd7 12.Bf4 Nc6 (Nowicki-Cross, correspondence 1999) and Black's compensation is obvious, but at least White is still alive.]

**8...O-O 9.Nge2 Re8 10.Qf3 Nxc3 11.bxc3 Qxd4**

Cleverly exploiting all the pins. White is already busted.

**12.Bd2 Qe5 13.Qe3 Bc5 14.Qxe5 Rxe5 15.Bf4 Re7 16.O-O-O Ba3+ 17.Kd2 Na6 18.Nd4 Rd8 19.Re1 Rxd4+! 0-1**

### (21) Bonus: 2...Nf6 Scandi | Icelan - Overview 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4**

Option 1 The Icelandic Gambit:

**3...e6**

GM @avid Smerdon covered it well in the highly-acclaimed book Smerdon's Scandinavian back in 2015. I've gone in different directions in several variations while keeping true to the same style of dynamic, aggressive lines. Another excellent reference on the Icelandic Gambit is IndrekR's Chessable course The Fiery Icelandic Gambit: Highly recommended! Option 2:3...c6 which is covered in a set ofalternative lines. In this case, accepting the gambit with 4.dxc6?! is dubious. White's best is to play 4.d4 transposing to the Panov variation of the Caro-Kann after 4...cxd5 5.Nc3 I've opted to recommend the enterprising and relatively offbeat 5...g6 variation, which gives Black dynamic play and equalizes everywhere.

**4.dxe6**

4.d4 invites a transposition to a variation of exchange French after 4...exd5 4.Qa4?! is also covered.

**4...Bxe6**

We will cover all of White's main moves in detail, namely

**5.Nf3**

Thi@ is White's most popular move OTB with 500+ games. In online games, it's second most common with over 30000 games. 5.d4 is White's most popular continuation in online games with over 50000 games played. 5.Be2 has been seen in 200+ OTB games (5000+ online games). and 5.Nc3 essayed in 100+ OTB games (20000+ online games).

### (22) Bonus: 2...Nf6 Scandi | Icelan - Inspirational game #1: 0-1 Sok,A (2595)-Speelman 

The following is a historically important rapid game between two strong GMs, Andrei Sokolov with the White pieces and English legend Jonathan Speelman with Black.

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6**

Energetic piece play and rapid development are the name of the game in the Icelandic Gambit.

**4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.d4**

Natural but already a mistake. Rather than an asset, White's pawn duo is merely a target. The first player is far too underdeveloped to keep it together.

**5...Bb4+**

is Black's typical response to d2-d4 in the Iceland Gambit.

**6.Bd2 Qe7**

Black lines up the queen against White's king while reinforcing the bishop.

**7.Bxb4 Qxb4+ 8.Nd2 Nc6**

Fearless play by Speelman, homing in on the d4 pawn. Black is not at all worried about d5 since White is far too underdeveloped for it to matter.

**9.Ngf3 O-O-O 10.d5 Bg4**

ends up working out for Speelman but could have finished off White right away. The stunning 10...Nxd5!! was incredibly strong. White is busted after 11.cxd5 Bxd5 There's very little White can do about ...Bxf3 and ...Rhe8. For example 12.Be2 Bxf3 13.gxf3 Rhe8 with ...Nd4 coming next is winning. White's king on e1 is toast.

**11.Be2**

White returns the favor. 11.dxc6! was the way to go. Following 11...Rhe8+ 12.Be2 Nh5! Black has a dangerous initiative but White can neutralize it with 13.O-O Nf4 14.Re1 Rxe2 15.Rxe2 Bxf3 16.gxf3 bxc6 17.Re4 Rxd2 18.Qf1 Qd6± Black has excellent compensation for the exchange but objectively White is better. Needless to say, in a rapid and blitz game, Black's chances are undoubtedly preferable.

**11...Bxf3 12.Bxf3**

12.gxf3? runs into 12...Nxd5! 13.cxd5 Rxd5-+ with a decisive advantage. There's no way White is surviving this.

**12...Rhe8+**

Comes just in time before White can castle.

**13.Kf1 Nd4**

Black could have taken the pawn on b2, but Speelman was more interested in going after White's king.

**14.Qc1 Nxf3 15.Nxf3 Re4**

Hitting the c4 pawn and preparing to double-up on the e-file is very natural. Although not easy to spot 15...b5! was even stronger. White's central structure collapses.

**16.b3 Rde8 17.h3 Nh5**

The knight is headed to f4.17...Qc5! followed by ...Re2 to attack the f2 pawn was even stronger.

**18.g3**

White prevents ...Nf4 but ran straight into

**18...Nxg3+**

We're only 18 moves into the game and Black has already sacrificed both knights!

**19.fxg3 Re3 20.Ng1**

In a difficult position, White blunders. 20.Kg2 The cold-blooded engines point out that this move would have retained the balance. Following 20...Re2+ 21.Kf1 Qb6 22.Rh2! just about keeps White in the game. 22...Rxh2, 22...Qf6 23.Rf2!! R8e3 24.Qd1 holds on by a thread. 23.Nxh2 Qf6+ 24.Kg2 Re2+ 25.Kh1 Qe5 26.Qf1! leads to a draw after 26...Qe4+ 27.Nf3 Re3 28.Kg2 Re2+=<level start="22...Qf6"/>

**20...Qd6**

The queen switches over from the queenside to the kingside. There's no saving White now.

**21.Rh2**

intends to meet ...Qf6+ with Rf2, but Black can just go ahead and grab the g3 pawn.

**21...Rxg3 22.Qb2 Qg6 23.Kf2 Ree3**

Total domination, White quickly lost after

**24.Ne2 Rgf3+ 25.Ke1 Qg1+**

wins the rook on h2 since White's knight is pinned.

**26.Kd2 Qxh2 27.Re1 Qf2**

Alr@ady an exchange down and with his king still in great peril, White had seen enough. 0-1 (27) Sokolov,A (2595)-Speelman,J (2625) Madrid 1988

### (23) Bonus: 2...Nf6 Scandi | Icelan - Inspirational game #2: 0-1 Zar,P (2488)-Fiorito 

IM Fabian Fiorito shows how powerful the Icelandic Gambit can be against an unprepared opponent, taking down GM Pablo Zarnicki in style.

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6 4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.d4 Bb4+ 6.Bd2 Qe7 7.Bxb4 Qxb4+ 8.Qd2**

Instead of Sokolov's 8.Nd2 , White prefers to block the check with the queen.

**8...Qe7**

Black brings the queen back to e7, lining it up against White's king.

**9.Qe3**

9.Be2? drops the c4 pawn to 9...Bxc4⩱

**9...Nc6 10.Nf3**

is a mistake and the start of White's undoing. 10.Be2! preventing ...Ng4, was far better. White would then have been able to secure his king with Nf3 and O-O.

**10...Ng4**

This is the problem. Black pushes back White's queen to e2.

**11.Qe2**

The queen on e2 is completely misplaced, blocking in the f1 bishop. White's king is now stuck in the center and ripe for an attack.

**11...O-O-O 12.h3**

White tries to get rid of the g4 knight, but Black can just ignore it with

**12...Rhe8**

White is so underdeveloped that taking the knight loses by force. Conversely, Black is fully mobilized and ready to move in for the kill. White's king on e1 is toast.

**13.hxg4 Qb4+**

13 moves into the game and White is already dead lost. The pin along the e-file will prove decisive.

**14.Qd2**

14.Nfd2 Nxd4-+ is lights out. 14.Nbd2 is also no good due to 14...Bxc4-+ winning White's queen. Finally 14.Nc3 Bxc4-+ wins the house.

**14...Bxg4+ 15.Be2 Rxe2+**

Boom! Black removes the only defender of White's king and forces it to move up the board.

**16.Kxe2 Nxd4+**

There's no safe square for the king.

**17.Kf1**

White tries to hide it on the kingside but this is no safe haven. 17.Ke1 Bxf3 18.gxf3 Nxf3+-+ wins the house

**17...Qxc4+ 18.Kg1 Nxf3+ 19.gxf3 Bxf3**

There's no need to capture the queen when you can mate White's king! Capturing the queen isn't nearly as strong due 19...Rxd2 20.Nxd2 Qe2 21.fxg4 Qxd2-+ Black is still winning but the text is far stronger.

**20.Rh3**

White lifts the rook, intending to meet

**20...Qg4+**

with

**21.Rg3**

but White's defense falls apart after

**21...Qh5 22.Rxf3 Qxf3**

No @atter where White's queen moves to, ...Rd1+ will come. White resigned in what was a great attacking miniature and a game GM Zarnicki won't want to remember. 0-1 (22) Zarnicki,P (2488)-Fiorito,F (2418) Buenos Aires 2000

### (24) Bonus: 2...Nf6 Scandi | Icelan - 4. dxe6 5. Nc3 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6**

is known as the Icelandic Gambit - a very tricky and fully sound Gambit. It derives its name from the Icelandic GMs Hannes Stefánsson and Throstur Thórhallsson, who essayed it with success in the 1980s. Instead of taking the pawn on d5, Black sacrifices a pawn in exchange for a lead in development and energetic piece play. Black's development scheme typically consists of ...Nc6 and redeploying the light-squared bishop to g4 or f5. The dark-squared bishop is usually placed on c5, when d2-d4 is prevented, or on b4, particularly in response to d2-d4. Black's queen also comes out to e7 in a variety of lines to disrupt White's development. White has to be extremely careful to avoid a whole array of traps, with many seemingly natural moves landing the first player in hot water. With precise play, the best White can achieve is a small advantage in an endgame where Black still has his fair share of chances.

**4.dxe6**

Accepting the Gambit is the only way for White to try and prove an advantage.

**4...Bxe6 5.Nc3**

is a dubious move. It does not support d2-d4 nor helps White get the king to safety.

**5...Nc6 6.Nf3 Qe7**

is a thematic move in the Icelandic Gambit. The queen pops out on e7 and disrupts White's coordination.

**7.Qe2**

Whi@e follows suit but in blocking the e-file, the first player ceases control over the c2 square. 7.Be2 dropped the c4 pawn to 7...Bxc4 with Black going on to win in the game 0-1 (91) Belkhodja,S (2405)-Rausis,I (2520) France 1998.7.g3?? featured in one of David Smerdon's online blitz games. White resigned without even waiting for ...Bd5+ or ...Bg4+ to land on the board.

**7...Nb4 8.d4 Bf5**

There's no stopping ...Nc2+ now. The following sequence is White's best:

**9.Nh4 Nc2+ 10.Kd2**

The bishop on f5 is hanging so there's no time for ...Nxa1, but Black can instead play

**10...Nxd4**

Picking up a pawn and covering the bishop.

**11.Qxe7+ Bxe7 12.Nxf5 Nxf5 13.Bd3 O-O-O**

White is completely pinned down and the king on d2 is ripe for an attack.

### (25) Bonus: 2...Nf6 Scandi | Icelan - 5. d3 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6**

**4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.d3**

is as anti-positional as it gets. Just ask the bishop on f1 how he feels about the pawns on d3 and c4.

**5...Nc6**

followed by ...Bc5 will take firm control over the d4 square.

**6.Nf3 Bc5 7.Be3 Qe7 8.Nc3 O-O-O**

With ...Rhe8 and ...Bg4 on the way, White needs to tread carefully to stay in the game.

### (26) Bonus: 2...Nf6 Scandi | Icelan - 5. b3 #1 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6**

**4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.b3**

is a terrible move, which didn't stop it from being played over 2000 times. I still have yet to understand White's idea.

**5...Bc5 6.Bb2**

Fianchettoing the dark-squared bishop can't be White's intention with 5.b3 since White is dead lost after

**6...Ne4**

immediately targeting the vulnerable f2 pawn.

**7.d4**

7.Nh3 Bxh3 8.gxh3 Bxf2+-+ requires no comment. 7.Qe2 allows 7...Bxf2+ 8.Kd1 Bd4! gives White no time to take on e4.9.Bxd4 Qxd4 with a completely winning position. Finally 7.Qc2 Nxf2 8.d4 Bxd4-+ is lights out.

**7...Bb4+**

White blocked the attack on f2, but in turn exposed the a5-e1 diagonal.

**8.Ke2 Qh4 9.g3 Qe7**

White can resign as there's no defense to ...Bg4+ or ...Bxc4+ followed by a deadly knight discovery. Stepping out of the e-file with 10.Kd3 walks straight into 10...Nxf2+-+ winning the house. Similarly 10.f3 Bxc4+ 11.bxc4 Nc3+-+ wins White's queen and the game.

### (27) Bonus: 2...Nf6 Scandi | Icelan - 5. b3 #2 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6**

**4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.b3**

**5...Bc5 6.Nc3**

stops ...Ne4 but Black can hit f2 from another angle with

**6...Ng4 7.Nh3 Nc6 8.Be2 Nge5**

The knight drops back to safety, opening up the way for ...Bxh3.

**9.O-O Bxh3 10.gxh3 Qh4**

And there's absolutely no need to learn any other moves. White's position is as bad as it looks.

### (28) Bonus: 2...Nf6 Scandi | Icelan - 5. b3 #3 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6**

**4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.b3**

**5...Bc5 6.Nf3**

intends to meet

**6...Ne4**

with

**7.d4 Nc6**

And here comes the banger! The bishop on c5 is untouchable as

**8.dxc5 Qxd1+ 9.Kxd1 Nxf2+**

picks up the rook. After ...Nxh1, Black will quickly bring his rooks into the game with ...O-O-O and ...Rhe8. White is clearly worse.

### (29) Bonus: 2...Nf6 Scandi | Icelan - 5. Be2 #1 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6**

**4.dxe6**

**4...Bxe6 5.Be2**

is White's third most popular move and a very unambitious option. White players surprised by our Gambit are likely to choose this safe option and prioritize getting their king to safety with a quick Nf3 and O-O.

**5...Nc6 6.Nf3 Bc5**

clamps down on the d4 square, ensuring White will not be able to get d2-d4 in. The semi-open d-file and the weak d4 and d3 squares give Black long-lasting compensation for the sacrificed pawn. The plan is to complete development and then pile on White's backward d-pawn.

**7.O-O O-O 8.Nc3 Re8 9.d3 Bf5**

The backward d3 pawn is a big target. With ...Qd7 and ...Rad8 on the way, Black has excellent compensation for the pawn deficit.

### (30) Bonus: 2...Nf6 Scandi | Icelan - 5. Be2 #2 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6**

**4.dxe6**

**4...Bxe6 5.Be2**

**5...Nc6 6.Nf3 Bc5**

**7.O-O O-O 8.d3 Re8 9.Nbd2**

is an alternative development scheme. Instead of posting the knight on c3, the b1 knight is heading to b3 to attack our bishop and support d2-d4.

**9...a5**

is an excellent reply. Black creates a square for the bishop on a7, secures the b4 square as an outpost, and will be threatening to drive back White's knight with ...a4.

**10.Nb3 Ba7 11.a4**

White does best in preventing Black from playing ...a4, but this comes at the cost of weakening the b4 square.

**11...Nb4**

is a prime outpost for the knight. Black is in great shape and can look to pile up on the d3 pawn with ...Bf5, ...Qd7, and ...Rad8.

### (31) Bonus: 2...Nf6 Scandi | Icelan - 5. d4 6. Nc3 #1 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6**

**4.dxe6**

**4...Bxe6 5.d4**

What could be more natural than taking over the center and establishing a central pawn duo? This is White's most common move, but the d4 and c4 pawns turn out to be nothing but targets in the subsequent lines.

**5...Bb4+**

is a typical response to d2-d4. The c5 square is unavailable for obvious reasons but b4 is a great alternative.

**6.Nc3**

is White's most common move by a wide margin in online games. Such a seemingly natural way of blocking the check is, however, a big mistake.

**6...Ne4**

This is the point. Black piles on the pinned piece, which White has no convenient way of covering.

**7.Nge2**

7.Bd2?? is even worse, blundering the d4 pawn to 7...Qxd4-+ which also threatens Qxf2#.

**7...Bxc4**

Oops, that dropped a pawn. 7 moves in and Black is already better.

### (32) Bonus: 2...Nf6 Scandi | Icelan - 5. d4 6. Nc3 #2

**4.dxe6**

**4...Bxe6 5.d4**

**5...Bb4+**

**6.Nc3**

**6...Ne4**

**7.Qd3 Bf5**

Black lines up the bishop against White's queen, setting up a whole array of nasty discoveries. If that weren't enough, ...O-O followed by ...Re8 is coming very quickly. White is far too underdeveloped to contain Black's initiative.

**8.Bd2**

is no good due to the following tactical sequence: 8.Qe3? gets out of the pin but steps into another one after 8...O-O−+ with ...Re8 coming next. White is already dead lost here.

**8...O-O 9.O-O-O Nxc3**

And the fireworks start! The tactics work out in Black's favor.

**10.Qxf5 Nxd1 11.Bxb4 Qxd4 12.Bxf8 Nxf2**

Whi@e found himself in a dead lost position in the game 0-1 (46) Kruszynski,W (2330) -Dejkalo,S (2395) Warsaw 1987. Black is temporarily down a piece but with a mating threat on d1, White will end up down material in short order. There's no time for 13.Qc8?? due to 13...Qd1 Checkmate! 13.Qd5 is no good. Simply 13...Qxd5 14.cxd5 Kxf8-+ will leave Black with an extra rook. There's no saving the rook on h1. Finally 13.Be2 is strongly met by 13...Na6 N In the aforementioned game, Black played 13... Kxf8 but the text is far stronger. Following 14.Nf3 Qe3+ 15.Kb1 Nxh1-+ White can resign as both the e2 and f8 bishop are hanging.

**6...Ne4**

**7.Qd3 Bf5**

**8.a3**

Breaking the pin doesn't help White much.

**8...Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 O-O**

Next up is ...Re8 which will come with almost decisive effect.

**10.Qf3 Re8**

The bishop on f5 is now untouchable due to ...Nd6+.

**11.Be2**

11.Qxf5 blunders the queen to 11...Nd6+-+

**11...Qd7**

Cov@rs the f5 bishop. Black is clearly better with ...Nc6-a5 on the way. A nice game that illustrates the dynamism of Black's position continued 12.Bb2 Nc6 13.g4 Bg6 14.O-O-O Na5 threatens a cute checkmate with ...Ng5 followed by ...Nb3#. 15.Rd3 Nxc4 16.Re3 Ned2 17.Qxb7 Reb8 18.Qg2 Qb5 19.Ba1 Qb1 sealed the deal in 0-1 (19) Bilalic,M-Vescovi,G (2490) Medellin 1996.

**4.dxe6**

**4...Bxe6 5.d4**

**5...Bb4+**

**6.Bd2**

is a better way of dealing with the check than 6. Nc3.

**6...Qe7**

not only protects the d4 bishop but lines up the queen against White's king.

**7.Bxb4 Qxb4+ 8.Nd2**

blocks the check but there's no saving the b2 pawn after 8.Nc3? blunders the c4 pawn to 8...Bxc4⩱

**8...O-O 9.Be2 Qxb2**

Restores material equality with an attack on the d4 pawn.

**10.Ngf3 Bf5**

stops Rb1. Next up are ...Nc6 and ...Re8 with excellent prospects.

**5...Bb4+**

**6.Bd2**

**6...Qe7**

**7.Bxb4 Qxb4+ 8.Qd2**

At first sight, it may seem like White is doing well and will have enough time to complete development. The truth is White's position is on the verge of collapse! Let's find out why. 8.Nc3? blunders the c4 pawn to 8...Bxc4⩱

**8...Nc6 9.Nc3 O-O-O**

Hitting the d4 pawn. Once again, there's no need to worry about

**10.d5**

due to

**10...Ne5**

The bishop on e6 is untouchable due to the pin along the d-file. White's pawn on c4 is now hanging and if

**11.b3**

then simply

**11...c6**

White's center is about to collapse.

**6...Qe7**

**7.Bxb4 Qxb4+ 8.Qd2**

doesn't bail out White.

**9...Nxb4**

Threatens a deadly fork on c2, forcing

**10.Na3 O-O-O 11.d5 Bf5**

Coming up are ...Rhe8 and ...c6. White is unsurprisingly in big trouble with only one piece developed.

**6...Qe7**

**7.Bxb4 Qxb4+ 8.Qd2**

The fork has no effect whatsoever as none of Black's minors can be captured. With ...Rhe8 and ...Bg4 on the way, I can't imagine anyone wanting White's position.

**6...Qe7**

**7.Qe2**

Copying Black is ill-advised.

**7...Nc6 8.Nf3 O-O-O**

The d4 pawn is under a ton of pressure, forcing

**9.d5**

which can just be ignored with the remarkable

**9...Rhe8**

White is so far behind in development that he can't even afford to spend a tempo capturing either of Black's minors!

**10.dxe6**

10.dxc6 is also no good on account of 10...Qd6-+ with ...Bg4 or ...Bxc4 coming next. White is busted.

**10...Qc5**

is lights out. The traffic jam on the e-file created by Qe2 is White's undoing.

**9.d5**

**9...Rhe8**

White is so far behind in development, that he can't take a single one of Black's minors.

**10.Nc3 Bxc3 11.Bxc3 Qc5**

is an idea we've seen before. The queen steps out of the e-file, unmasking the rook on e8.

**12.O-O-O**

White hurries the king to safety but to little avail. Following

**12...Bxd5 13.Qc2 Be4 14.Bd3 Rxd3**

This tactical shot decides the game. As the saying goes, tactics always favor the side that is on top!

**15.Rxd3 Qxc4 16.Rhd1 Qxa2**

Whi@e is busted. Black can (at the very least) take on d3 at any time and end up with two extra pawns.

**6.Bd2**

**6...Qe7**

**7.Be2**

may very well be White's best option. White blocks the e-file and wants to quickly get the king to safety.

**7...O-O**

Wit@ the king perfectly safe on g8 (and not exposed to Qa4+), Black is now threatening to pick up the c4 pawn. Watch out 7...Bxc4?? blunders 8.Qa4++-

**8.d5 Bg4 9.Bxb4 Qxb4+ 10.Qd2 Na6**

Black has a lasting initiative even if the queens come off the board. The rooks are on their way to the central files and ...c6 to undermine White's center will soon follow.

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6**

**4.dxe6**

**4...Bxe6 5.Nf3**

It's now time to turn our attention to White's best move now that we've seen the problems with the various other 5th moves. The first player delays d2-d4 for the time being and instead prioritizes kingside development.

**5...Qe7**

is Black's most ambitious continuation, threatening ...Bxc4+. This effectively forces White to follow suit with Qe2.

**6.Be2**

drops the c4 pawn to

**6...Bxc4**

After

**7.d3 Ba6 8.Nc3 Nc6 9.O-O O-O-O**

Black is in great shape. Next up is ... Qd7 with sustained pressure against White's d3 pawn.

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6**

**4.dxe6**

**4...Bxe6 5.Nf3**

**5...Qe7**

**6.Qe2**

is the way to go. Black's main argument in this line is that the awkward placement of both queens is more detrimental for White, who will have to forego kingside castling to hold onto the extra pawn. The disadvantage of Black's early queen sortie is that the dark-squared bishop is blocked, enabling White to play d2-d4 without worrying about ... Bb4.

**6...Nc6 7.d4 Bf5**

is three times less popular than 7...Bg4 and 7...O-O-O but far stronger.

**8.Be3**

is the main move against 7...Bg4 but here it is a big mistake. With the bishop on f5, Black controls the c2 and d3 squares, enabling

**8...Nb4 9.Na3**

covers the c2 square, but fails to prevent

**9...Nd3+ 10.Kd1 O-O-O**

is about as bad it looks for White. The king is stuck in the center, we have a monster knight on d3 and ...Qb4 is coming next.

has little independent value. It's very likely to transpose to the 8. Qxe7 variation following

**8...O-O-O 9.Qxe7**

9.d5?! is no good due to 9...Na5 Black's knight is headed to b3 - a square weakened by White's 8. a3 move. 10.Nd4 Bg6 11.Be3?! c5 12.Nc2 Nb3 13.Nc3 was reached in the game 1-0 (56) Woeber,F (2115)-Reiss,S (2103) Vienna 2015.

**6...Nc6 7.d4 Bf5**

**8.Qxe7+ Bxe7**

Yes, the queens are off the board. Nevertheless, Black still has a big lead in development, which offers ample compensation for the sacrificed pawn. The d4 pawn will quickly come under attack with ...O-O-O and the c2 square is also particularly vulnerable to a knight incursion such as ...Nb4. Energetic play giving White no time to consolidate is the name of the game for Black here.

**9.Be3**

White reinforces the d4 pawn in anticipation of ...O-O-O.

**9...Nb4 10.Na3 O-O**

Our king is better placed on the kingside since we want to break in the center with ...c5 later on. Black's play is very natural, with moves like ...Ng4, ...Rfe8, and ...Rad8 on the agenda.

**11.h3**

11.Be2 is well met by 11...Ng4 12.O-O Nxe3 13.fxe3 g6= Black's bishop pair offer full compensation for the pawn deficit. The backward pawn on e3 is a big target and White's knight on a3 is completely offside.

**11...c5**

An important pawn break, undermining White's center.

**12.Be2 Ne4**

clearing the way for ...Bf6 to increase the pressure on the d-pawn gives Black excellent play. The superior piece activity offers full compensation for the pawn deficit.

Brining the a8 rook into the game and homing in on the d4 pawn is my preferred option. 9...Na5 is another interesting possibility, but it requires learning a lot more theory for little gain. It's well covered in the book Smerdon's Scandinavian and IndrekR's Chessable course The Fiery Icelandic Gambit.

**10.Be3 Rhe8 11.Nc3**

11.Be2 doesn't change Black's plan 11...Na5 12.Nbd2 c5 with firm pressure on the d4 pawn. Coming next is ...Ng4 with good prospects.

**11...Bf8**

uncovers the rook on e8. Black is fully mobilized and with ...Ng4 on the way, the second player can look to the future with confidence.

### (46) 20. Lead in development - Andrey Sokolov vs. Jonathan Sp 

IntroductionCapablanca once expressed the fear that chess would soon die a 'draw death'. If technique is mastered to perfection, there is no way to break through for any of the two sides, he thought. Fortunately, this defeatism has not become reality. On the contrary: in present-day grandmaster practice, games are fought out to the death, which makes the draw rate - even in top tournaments - relatively low. Under Kasparov's influence, even gambit play has returned to the elite level. For example, the 13th World Champion more than once ventured the Evans Gambit, which occurs after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4!? And with success: esteemed opponents like Anand and Piket had to bite the dust against him. In all gambits, material plays a secondary role. A player who invests material does this exclusively with the intention to bring his own pieces into play as quickly as possible, whereas a number of his opponent's pieces remain on their original squares. Everything revolves around the activity of one's own pieces and the passivity of the opponent's pieces. We call this a 'lead in development'.There are different possible causes for the occurrence of an advantage in development. For example, careless piece play (moving out the queen too quickly, or playing with the same piece twice) can lead to a lag in development. Another cause can be a faulty exchange. In one of his manuals, Euwe indicated the difference between exchanging and having your opponent exchange. In many cases, the side that exchanges a piece brings his opponent's pieces into play. Too many pawn moves can have disastrous consequences as well.In the following game we see how gambit play leads to quick development, and even to a furious attack on the king.

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.c4 e6**

A curious gambit, which is not as bad as it looks at first sight. Black gives up a centre pawn in order to bring two pieces into play.

**4.dxe6 Bxe6 5.d4 Bb4+ 6.Bd2 Qe7 7.Bxb4 Qxb4+ 8.Nd2**

The alternative 8.Qd2 is played more frequently.

**8...Nc6**

This move is what this gambit is about, Black does not bother about material and brings up new artillery.

**9.Ngf3**

White does not go for the pawn fork that Black allowed with his last move. The move 9.d5 leads, after 9...O-O-O ! to the following complications:

A: 9...O-O-O 10.dxe6 Rhe8 11.Be2 Rxe6 and White can no longer defend against the many threats;

B: 9...O-O-O 10.Be2 Nxd5 11.cxd5 Bxd5 and now, for example, 12.Kf1 doesnt work in view of 12...Be4! winning - this line was found by a reader, Jon Florin;

C: 10.dxc6 Rhe8 11.cxb7+ Kb8 12.Be2 better is 12.f3 although also then, after 12...Bxc4+ 13.Be2 Qxb2 Black has more than enough play for the sacrificed material 12...Ne4 13.Nf3 Nxd2 14.Nxd2 Bxc4 and Black wins back his piece with interest.<level start="12.f3"/><level start="12...Bxc4"/>

**9...O-O-O 10.d5 Bg4 11.Be2**

Once again White does not accept the piece. Whether this is justified, is debatable. After 11.dxc6 Rhe8+ 12.Be2 Bxf3 13.gxf3, Black has a choice between two moves to maintain the pressure:

A: 13.gxf3 Re6 seems insufficient in view of 14.a3 Qa5, 14...Qe7!? may be a viable alternative 15.cxb7+ Kb8 16.c5!? the silicon monster comes up with this move. Not 16.b4 Qe5 17.Ra2 Nh5! , and Black wins back the piece; or 16.Qc2 Rde8 17.O-O-O Rxe2 and also here, Black has his piece back, and he has splendid compensation for the pawns he has lost along the way. 16...Rxe2+!? Black must take action now;<level start="14...Qe7"/>

16...Rde8 17.O-O Rxe2 18.Nb3 Qa4 19.Nd4 is very good, if not winning for White 17.Qxe2 17.Kxe2? Qb5+ 18.Ke1 Re8+ and Black wins 17...Re8 18.Qxe8+ Nxe8 19.Rc1 and White has the better prospects, although Black is by no means without chances;<skip/>

B: After 13...Nh5 14.a3 14.Qc2 g6 15.cxb7+ Kb8 16.a3 Qe7 17.Nf1 14...Qe7 Black will follow up with the devastating 15... Nf4.

**11...Bxf3 12.Bxf3 Rhe8+ 13.Kf1**

White must give up the right to castle, and as a consequence he cannot get the h1-rook into the game. Now Black clearly gets the upper hand.

**13...Nd4 14.Qc1 Nxf3 15.Nxf3 Re4 16.b3 Rde8 17.h3**

The diagram position shows the difference in activity between the white and the black pieces. All this for one lousy pawn !

**17...Nh5 18.g3**

A provocation. Speelman immediately picks up the gauntlet.

**18...Nxg3+**

A piece sacrifice with which the protection of the king is shattered.

**19.fxg3 Re3 20.Ng1**

Oddly enough, White should have opted for 20.Kg2! with which he could have brought his h1-rook into play. Black has nothing better than 20...Re2+ 21.Kf1 after which this game would have ended peacefully with a repetition of moves.

**20...Qd6**

An elegant retreat. The queen aims at the weak point g3 and threatens to intervene decisively via the third rank.

**21.Rh2**

21.Qb2 was relatively better.

**21...Rxg3 22.Qb2 Qg6 23.Kf2 Ree3**

Threatening 24... Qf5, against which there is nothing sensible to be found.

**24.Ne2 Rgf3+**

Not bad, but Speelman misses a nice mate in three: 24...Qf5+ 25.Ke1 Rg1+ 26.Kd2 Qd3#

**25.Ke1 Qg1+ 26.Kd2 Qxh2 27.Re1 Qf2 \***

### (47) 6. Scandinavian Defense - Scandinavian Defense,Modern Variation 

**1.e4 d5**

Scandinavian Defense

**2.exd5 Nf6**

Modern Variation

**3.c4**

Holding on to the d5 pawn isn't the best idea.

**3...e6**

Icelandic-Palme Gambit, an interesting gambit, especially on lower levels. The idea is to sacrifice a pawn for rapid development.

**4.dxe6**

Trading a pair of pawns.

**4...Bxe6 5.d4**

Expanding in the center is quite risky in this position.

**5...Bb4+**

Developing a piece with tempo. Black has three pieces developed and is ready to castle!

**6.Nc3**

Blocking the check with the Knight.

**6...Ne4**

Attacking the Knight with an extra piece. White is under serious pressure.

**7.Bd2**

Defending the Knight. A bad move, played hundreds of times. White's Queen is no longer protecting the pawn on d4 .

**7...Qxd4**

Grabbing an important center pawn while threatening checkmate on f2 .

**8.Nxe4**

Trading pieces, White's best try.

**8...Qxe4+**

Bla@k is controlling the game (-2.0). White will have a hard time to bring his King to safety.

**6.Nc3**

**6...Ne4**

**7.Qa4+**

Check, forking King and Bishop. This is the second most played move, but it isn't a good one...

**7...Nc6**

Blocking the check while developing the Knight and defending the Bishop.

**8.d5**

Forking the pinned Knight and the Bishop. It looks like a good move, but it actually is a blunder. By far the most played move in this position. 8.Nge2 Bxc4 is White's best continuation.

**8...Qf6**

A brilliant move: Putting even more pressure on c3 while threatening to take the f2 pawn with check.

**9.Nf3**

Defending against Qxf2+.

**9...Nxc3**

Capturing a piece, attacking White's Queen.

**10.bxc3**

The only sensible move. White's Queen was trapped...

**10...Qxc3+**

Che@k, forking King and Rook. White is busted (-8.0).

**7.Qd3**

Defending the Knight on c3 while attacking Black's Knight. A suboptimal move.

**7...Bf5**

Def@nding the Knight in the center while eyeing on White's Queen with the Bishop. This is the only move that gives Black an advantage (-1.0).

**8.Qe3**

A b@under. White wanted to keep an eye on the Knight on c3 while pinning Black's Knight to the King. 8.a3 would have been the best move in this position, in view of 8...Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 (-1.0).

**8...O-O**

A g@eat move! Black is ready to bring even more pieces into the game (-5.0). By practicing a position like this against a strong engine, you will make the most out of it.
