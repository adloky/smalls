BOOK 1

CHAPTER I

On the pleasant shore of the French Riviera, about half way between Marseilles and the Italian border, stands a large, proud, rose-colored hotel. Palms cool its ﬂushed façade, and before it stretches a short dazzling beach. Lately it has become a summer resort of notable and fashionable people; a decade ago it was almost deserted after its English clientele went north in April. Now, many bungalows are near it, but when this story begins only a dozen old villas rotted like water lilies among the pines between Gausse's Hôtel des Étrangers and Cannes, ﬁve miles away.

A mile from the sea is an isolated railroad stop, where one June morning in 1925 a woman and her daughter arrived and went down to Gausse's Hotel. The mother's face was of a fading prettiness. However, one's eye moved on quickly to her daughter, who had magic in her pink cheeks lit to a lovely ﬂame. Her ﬁne forehead sloped gently up to where her hair burst into waves of ash blonde and gold. Her eyes were bright, big, clear, wet, and shining. Her body was on the last edge of childhood — she was almost eighteen but the dew was still on her.

The mother said:

"Something tells me we're not going to like this place."

"I want to go home anyhow," the girl answered.

"We'll stay three days and then go home. I'll wire right away for steamer tickets."

At the hotel the girl made the reservation in idiomatic French, like something remembered. When they got their room on the ground ﬂoor she walked through the French windows and out a few steps onto the stone veranda that ran around the hotel. When she walked she carried herself like a ballet dancer. Fifty yards away the Mediterranean yielded up its pigments, moment by moment, to the brutal sunshine.

Of all the region only the beach stirred with activity. Three British nannies sat knitting. Closer to the sea a dozen persons were sitting under striped umbrellas, while their dozen children pursued ﬁsh in water or lay naked in the sun.

Rosemary came onto the beach, took off her bathrobe and dashed into the sea. She ﬂoated face down for a few yards and finding it shallow walked forward. When it was about breast high, she looked back toward shore: a bald man with a hairy chest in a monocle and a pair of tights was looking at her attentively. As Rosemary saw it, the man poured himself a glass of something from a bottle in his hand. Rosemary laid her face on the water and swam to the raft. Reaching it she was out of breath, but a tanned woman with very white teeth looked down at her, and Rosemary, suddenly realizing the whiteness of her own body, turned on her back and swam toward shore. The hairy man holding the bottle spoke to her as she came out with a slow Oxford drawl. "You're a fine swimmer."

Rosemary looked for a place to sit.11 Obviously each family possessed the strip of sand immediately in front of its umbrella; besides there was much visiting and talking — the atmosphere of a community which did not welcome a stranger. Farther up sat a group with bodies as white as her own. They lay under small handparasols instead of beach umbrellas and had obviously spent less time at the place. Between the dark people and the light, Rosemary found room and spread out her peignoir on the sand.

Lying so, she first heard their voices. A white-haired woman in full evening dress, obviously worn since the previous evening, with a tiara on her head was saying something in a shrill scornful voice. Rosemary, feeling a vague antipathy to her and her companions, turned away.

Nearest her, on the other side, a young woman lay under a roof of umbrellas making out a list of things from a book open on the sand. She had a string of creamy pearls round her neck. Her face was hard and lovely. Her eyes met Rosemary's but did not see her. Beyond her was a ﬁne man in a jockey cap and red tights; then the woman Rosemary had seen on the raft; then a man with a long face and a golden, leonine head, with blue tights and no hat, talking very seriously to a young man in black tights. She thought they were mostly Americans, but something made them unlike the Americans she had known before.

The man of the monocle and bottle spoke suddenly out of the sky above Rosemary.

"My name is Campion. Here is a lady who says she saw you in Sorrento last week and knows who you are and would so like to meet you."

Looking around with annoyance Rosemary saw the untanned people were waiting. She got up and went over to them.

"Mrs. Abrams — Mrs. McKisco — Mr. McKisco — Mr. Dumphry —"

"We know who you are," spoke up the woman in evening dress. "You're Rosemary Hoyt and I recognized you in Sorrento and asked the hotel clerk and we all think you're perfectly marvellous and we want to know why you're not back in America making another marvellous moving picture."

The woman continued:

"We wanted to warn you about getting burned the ﬁrst day.18"

Rosemary looked at them all uncomfortably: Mrs. McKisco, a pretty young woman with an intensive manner, Mr. Dumphry, a young man, stout Mrs. Abrams, wishing her mother had come down here with her. She did not like these people, especially in comparison with those who had interested her at the other end of the beach. Her mother's social gift got them out of unwelcome situations swiftly and ﬁrmly. But Rosemary had been a celebrity for only six months, and sometimes the French manners of her early childhood and the democratic manners of America made a certain confusion and let her in just such uncomfortable situations.

Mr. McKisco, freckle-and-red man of thirty turned to Rosemary and demanded aggressively:

"Been here long?" "Only a day." "Oh."

"Going to stay all summer?" asked Mrs. McKisco.

Without waiting for an answer Mr. McKisco got up to go in the water, followed by his wife, and Rosemary followed, too.

"Shall we go to the raft?" Mr.

McKisco asked.

The man with the leonine head lay stretched out upon the raft and he greeted them as they reached it.

He had one of the saddest faces Rosemary had ever seen, the high cheekbones of an Indian, a long upper lip, and enormous deep-set dark golden eyes. In a minute he had dived into the water and swam toward shore. Rosemary and Mrs. McKisco watched him.

"He's a good swimmer," Rosemary said.

Mrs. McKisco's answer came with surprising violence.

"Well, he's a rotten musician." She turned to her husband, who after two unsuccessful attempts had managed to climb on the raft. "I was just saying that Abe North may be a good swimmer but he's a rotten musician."

"Yes," agreed McKisco.

The woman of the pearls had joined her two children in the water, and now Abe North came up under one of them like a volcanic island, raising him on his shoulders. The child yelled with fear and delight and the woman watched without a smile.

"Is that his wife?" Rosemary asked. "No, that's Mrs. Diver. They're not at the hotel. Have you been abroad before?"

"Yes — I went to school in Paris." "Oh! Well then you probably know that if you want to enjoy yourself here you have to know some real French families. What do these people get out of it?" She pointed toward shore. "They just stick around with each other. Of course, we had letters of introduction and met all the best French artists and writers in Paris. That made it very nice."

"I should think so."

"My husband is ﬁnishing his ﬁrst novel, you see."

Rosemary said: "Oh, he is?" She was not thinking anything special, except wondering whether her mother had got to sleep in this heat.

"It's on the idea of Ulysses," continued Mrs. McKisco.

"Oh, for God's sake, Violet, don't go telling everybody the idea," protested McKisco. "I don't want it to get all around before the book's published."

Rosemary swam back to the shore, where she threw her peignoir over her already sore shoulders and lay down again in the sun.

Campion walked near her, stood a few feet away and Rosemary closed her eyes, pretending to be asleep; then she fell really asleep.

She awoke to find the beach deserted save for the man in the jockey cap, who was folding a last umbrella. He walked nearer and said:

"I was going to wake you before I left. It's not good to get too burned right away."

"Thank you." Rosemary looked down at her crimson legs.

"Heavens!"

He looked at her and for a moment she lived in the bright blue worlds of his eyes, eagerly and conﬁdently. She laughed cheerfully, inviting him to talk, but Dick Diver was already carrying a tent and a beach umbrella up to a waiting car, so she went into the water.

CHAPTER II

It was almost two when they went into the dining-room. Two waiters brought them luncheon.

"I fell in love on the beach," said Rosemary.

"Who with?"

"First with a whole lot of people who looked nice. Then with one man."

"Did you talk to him?"

"Just a little. Very handsome. With reddish hair. He's married though — it's usually the way."

Her mother was her best friend and had put every effort into guiding her, not so rare a thing in the theatrical profession. Unlike other mothers, Mrs. Elsie Speers was not recompensing herself for a defeat of her own. She had been happily married and twice widowed. One of her husbands had been a cavalry ofﬁcer and one an army doctor, and they both left something to her that she tried to keep for Rosemary. She had made her daughter hard and she had cultivated an idealism in her. "Then you like it here?" she asked.

"It might be fun if we knew those people. There were some other people, but they weren't nice. They recognized me — it seems everybody's seen ‘Daddy's Girl.'"

Mrs. Speers said: "That reminds me, when are you going to see Earl Brady?"

"I thought we might go this afternoon — if you're rested."

"I want you to go alone. It's only a short way."

"All right, Mother."

"Let's only stay three days, Mother," Rosemary said when they were back in their rooms.

"How about the man you fell in love with on the beach?"

"I don't love anybody but you, Mother, darling."

Her shoulders were too burned to swim with the next day, so she and her mother hired a car and drove along the Riviera, the delta of many rivers. The chauffeur was a guide, and the well-known names — Cannes, Nice, Monte Carlo — whispered of old kings who came here to dine or die. Most of all, there was the scent of the Russians along the coast — their closed book shops and grocery stores. Ten years ago, when the season ended in April, the doors of the Orthodox Church were locked, and the sweet champagnes they favored were put away until their return. "We'll be back next season," they said, but they never came back any more.

It was pleasant to drive back to the hotel in the late afternoon, above a sea.

Back at the hotel, Rosemary listened to the music realizing that there was a party somewhere, and she thought of the nice people on the beach. She thought she might meet them in the morning, but they obviously formed a self-sufﬁcient little group closed to a stranger. She decided in any case not to spend her last two mornings with the other ones.

The matter was solved for her. The McKiscos were not yet there and she had scarcely spread her peignoir when two men left the group and came down toward her.

"Good morning," said Dick Diver. "Look — sunburn or no sunburn, why did you stay away yesterday? We worried about you. We wondered if you wouldn't come over this morning."

He seemed kind and charming — his voice promised that he would take care of her, and that a little later he would open up whole new worlds for her. He managed the introduction so that her name wasn't mentioned and then let her know easily that everyone knew who she was but were respecting her private life.

Nicole Diver was about twenty-four, Rosemary guessed.

"Are you here for a long time?" Nicole asked. Her voice was low.

Suddenly Rosemary let the possibil- ity enter her mind that they might stay another week.

"Not very long," she answered. "We've been abroad a long time — we landed in Sicily in March and we've been slowly working our way north. I got pneumonia making a picture last January and I've been recuperating."

"Mercy! How did that happen?" "Well, it was from swimming. One day I happened to have the grippe and didn't know it, and they were taking a scene where I dove into a canal in Venice. I had to dive and dive and dive all morning. Mother had a doctor right there, but it was no use — I got pneumonia." She changed the subject before they could speak. "Do you like it here — this place?"

"They have to like it," said Abe North slowly. "They invented it." He turned his noble head slowly so that his eyes rested with tenderness and affection on the two Divers.

"Oh, did you?"

"This is only the second season that the hotel's been open in summer," Nicole explained. "We persuaded Gausse to keep on a cook and a garçon and a chasseur — it paid its way and this year it's doing even better."

"But you're not in the hotel." "We built a house, up at Tarmes." "The theory is," said Dick, arranging an umbrella over Rosemary's shoulder, "that all the northern places, like Deauville, were picked out by Russians and English who don't mind the cold, while half of us Americans come from tropical climates — that's why we're beginning to come here."

Abe North and Barban, the Frenchman, were talking about Morocco. Barban was a few years younger than Diver or North. He was tall and his body was hard and force was seen in his shoulders and upper arms. At ﬁrst glance he seemed handsome — but there was a faint disgust always in his face.

Rosemary examined their beach things — four large umbrellas, a portable bath house for dressing, new things that Rosemary had never seen, made after the War, and probably in the hands of the ﬁrst of purchasers. She had guessed that they were fashionable people, but though her mother had brought her up to believe such people to be drones, she did not feel that way here.

She looked in turn at the three men. Actors and directors — those were the only men she had ever known, those and college boys, interested only in love at ﬁrst sight, whom she had met at the Yale last fall.

These three were different. Barban was less civilized, more skeptical, his manners were formal. Abe North had humor that amused but puzzled her.

But Dick Diver — he was all complete there. Silently she admired him. His complexion was reddish, so was his short hair — a light growth of it rolled down his arms and hands. His eyes were of a bright, hard blue. His nose was somewhat pointed and there was never any doubt at whom he was looking or talking. His voice had some faint Irish melody in it, yet she felt hardness in him, self-control and self-discipline, her own virtues. Oh, she chose him, and Nicole, lifting her head, saw her choose him.

Toward noon the McKiscos, Mrs. Abrams, Mr. Dumphry, and Signor Campion came on the beach.

Mary North, the very tanned young woman whom Rosemary had met the first day on the raft, came in from swimming and said with a smile:

"Well, I HAVE felt there were too many people on the beach this summer," Nicole admitted. "OUR beach that Dick made out of a pebble pile."

"The day before you came, the married man, McKisco, and his wife were having words and she tossed some sand in his face. So he sat on top of her and rubbed her face in the sand. I wanted Dick to interfere," Nicole said. "I think," said Dick Diver, "that

I'll go over and invite them to dinner." "No, you won't," Nicole told him quickly. "I'm not going to have MY nose rubbed in the sand. I'm a mean, hard woman," she explained to Rosemary.

Rosemary thought she would not like to have Nicole for an enemy.

She stood with them as they took sherry and ate crackers. Dick Diver looked at her with cold blue eyes; his kind, strong mouth said thoughtfully: "You're the only girl I've seen for a long time that actually looked like something blooming."

In her mother's lap afterward Rosemary cried and cried.

"I love him, Mother. I'm desperately in love with him — I never knew I could feel that way about anybody. And he's married and I like her too — it's just hopeless. Oh, I love him so!"

"I'm curious to meet him."

"She invited us to dinner Friday."

"If you're in love it ought to make you happy. You ought to laugh."

Rosemary looked up and laughed. Her mother always had a great inﬂuence on her.

CHAPTER III

Rosemary went to Monte Carlo nearly as sulkily as it was possible for her to be. She rode up the hill to an old movie studio in process of reconstruction, and stood by the entrance waiting for an answer to the message on her card. After ten minutes a young man hurried down to the gate.

"Come in, Miss Hoyt. Mr. Brady's very anxious to see you. I'm sorry you were kept waiting, but you know some of these French women are trying to get themselves in—"

The studio manager opened a small door in the wall of stage building and Rosemary followed him. Presently, he said, "Hey, Earl — Miss Hoyt."

They were meeting for the first time. As Brady took her hand she saw him look her over from head to foot. "I thought you'd be here any day now," Brady said, in a voice with a cockney accent. "Have a good trip?"

"Yes, but we're glad to be going home."

"No-o-o!" he protested. "Stay awhile — I want to talk to you. Let me tell you that was some picture of yours — that Daddy's Girl. I saw it in Paris. I wired the coast right away to see if you were signed. What're your plans?"

"Mother thought I needed a rest. When I get back we'll probably either sign up with First National or keep on with Famous."

"Who's we?"

"My mother. She decides business matters. I couldn't do without her."

Again he looked her over completely, and, as he did, something in Rosemary went out to him. It was not liking, not at all the admiration she had felt for the man on the beach this morning. It was a click. He desired her and she did not mind surrendering. Yet she knew she would forget him half an hour after she left him — like an actor kissed in a picture.

"Where are you staying?" Brady asked. "Oh, yes, at Gausse's. Well, my plans are made for this year, too, but my offer still stands. Wait till after this shot and I'll show you around."

Walking onto the set he began to talk to a French actor in a low, quiet voice.

Five minutes passed — Brady talked on. Suddenly, he broke off, calling something to the lights and the shooting began. She did not want to see Brady in the mood he was in and she left the studio quietly and made her way for the train.

Feeling good after lunch, Nicole Diver went out into her lovely garden. Her face was hard, almost stern. Her once fair hair had darkened, but she was lovelier now at twenty-four than she had been at eighteen.

She went up the stairs and into the vegetable garden; she walked rather quickly — she liked to be active, though at times she was very quiet. This was because she did not believe in words. She reached a low wall and looked down seven hundred feet to the Mediterranean Sea.

She stood in the ancient hill village of Tarmes. The villa and its grounds were made out of a row of peasant houses on the cliff — ﬁve small houses had been combined to make their house and four were destroyed to make the garden.

Presently Dick came up to her. "Nicole," he said, "I forgot to tell you that I invited Mrs. Abrams, the woman with the white hair."

"I suspected it. It's a shame."

"I'm going to invite some more people too."

"All right," she agreed.

He went back into the house and Nicole saw that one of his most characteristic moods was upon him, the excitement that swept everyone up into it. To be included in Dick Diver's world for a while was a remarkable experience: people believed he made an exception for them, recognizing their uniqueness. He won everyone quickly but at the ﬁrst doubt in him he evaporated before their eyes.

At eight-thirty that evening he came out to meet his ﬁrst guests. Greeting Rosemary and her mother he waited for them to speak ﬁrst, as if to allow them the reassurance of their own voices in new surroundings. She and her mother were fascinated by the Villa Diana.

"What a beautiful garden!" Mrs.

Speers exclaimed.

"Nicole's garden," said Dick. "She won't let it alone — she worries about plant diseases all the time."

He turned them from the garden to the terrace, where he poured a cocktail. Earl Brady arrived, discovering Rosemary with surprise. His manner was softer than at the studio, and Rosemary, comparing him instantly with Dick Diver, turned toward the latter. In comparison Earl Brady seemed ill-bred; once more, though, she felt an electric response to his person.

He spoke to the children who were getting up from their outdoor supper. "Hello, Lanier, how about a song?

Will you and Topsy sing me a song?"

Brother and sister stood side by side without self-consciousness and sang, their voices sweet in the evening air.

After the singing stopped the children stood smiling calmly at their success. Rosemary was thinking that the Villa Diana was the centre of the world. At the moment the rest of the guests arrived in a body — the McKiscos, Mrs. Abrams, Mr. Dumphry, and Mr. Campion came up to the terrace. Rosemary had a sharp feeling of disappointment — she looked quickly at Dick, as though to ask an explanation of this unhappy choice of guests. But there was nothing unusual in his expression. He greeted his new guests warmly.

"I've met you in Paris," McKisco said to Abe North, who with his wife had arrived on their heels, "in fact I've met you twice."

"Yes, I remember," Abe said. Rosemary stood beside Tommy Barban — he was in a particularly bad mood. He was leaving in the morning.

"Going home?"

"Home? I have no home. I am going to a war."

"What war?"

"What war? Any war. I suppose there's a war — there always is."

"Don't you care what you ﬁght for?" "Not at all — so long as I'm well treated. When I'm not at war I come to see the Divers, because then I know that in a few weeks I'll want to go to war."

"You like the Divers?" she asked him.

"Of course — especially her — but they make me want to go to war." "You're half American," she said, as if that should solve the problem. "Also I'm half French, and I was educated in England and since I was eighteen I've worn the uniforms of eight countries. But I am fond of the Divers — especially of Nicole."

She felt far from him.

For a moment now she was beside Dick Diver on the path. For a year she had had money and a certain celebrity and contact with the celebrated. Rosemary was a romantic but her mother, with the idea of a career for Rosemary, would not tolerate any silly affair. So when she had seen approval of Dick Diver in her mother's face it meant that he was "the real thing"; it meant permission to go as far as she could.

"I fell in love with you the first time I saw you," she said quietly. He pretended not to have heard, as if the compliment were purely formal.

They had been at table half an hour and a change had set in — now they were only their best selves and the Divers' guests were friendly and interested. Rosemary liked everyone — except McKisco. After he tried breaking into others' dialogues, he devoted his attention entirely to the champagne. Looking at Nicole Rosemary found her one of the most beautiful people she had ever known. Her face was the face of a saint, a viking Madonna. She was talking to Abe North. Rosemary knew from Brady that he was a musician who after a brilliant start had composed nothing for seven years.

Just for a moment the Divers seemed to speak to every one at the table assuring them of their friendliness, their affection. The faces turned toward them like the faces of poor children at a Christmas tree.

Nicole disappeared and presently Rosemary noticed that Dick was no longer there; the guests went to the garden or the terrace.

Rosemary felt that this was her time to talk to Dick Diver when he re-appeared, so she stood, listening to McKisco quarrel with Barban.

"Why do you want to fight the Soviets?" McKisco said. "The greatest experiment ever made by humanity? It seems to me it would be more heroic to ﬁght on the just side."

"How do you ﬁnd out which it is?" asked Barban dryly.

"Why — usually everybody intelligent knows."

"Are you a Communist?"

"I'm a Socialist," said McKisco, "I sympathize with Russia."

"Well, I'm a soldier," Barban answered pleasantly. "My business is to kill people. I have fought the Communists because they want to take my property from me."

McKisco jumped at the conclusion that Barban was the end product of the old world, and as such, worthless. Feeling ashamed for McKisco, Rosemary waited for Dick Diver's return.

Mrs McKisco came hurrying down from the house. She was excited.

"My dear—" she said and then addressed Rosemary, "my dear — it's nothing. I really can't say a word."

"You're among friends," said Abe.

"Well, upstairs I came upon a scene, my dears—"

Tommy arose and addressed her politely but sharply:

"You shouldn't comment on what goes on in this house."

Violet breathed loud and hard but did not say anything.

Dick came finally and separated Barban and the McKiscos and discussed literature with McKisco — thus giving the latter the moment of superiority which he required.

Now — she was thinking — I must have some time alone with him.

Rosemary was right — presently he led her from the company on the terrace to the garden toward the seaside wall. They looked out over the Mediterranean.

"I was talking to your mother, she told me that how long you both stayed in France depended on you," he said.

On YOU, Rosemary all but said aloud.

"Since things are over here—" "Over?" she asked.

"Well, this part of the summer is over. Last week Nicole's sister left, tomorrow Tommy Barban leaves, Monday Abe and Mary North are leaving. Maybe we'll have more fun this summer but this particular fun is over. That's why I gave this party. Nicole and I are going up to Paris to see Abe North off for America — I wonder if you'd like to go with us."

"What did Mother say?"

"She seemed to think it would be ﬁne. She doesn't want to go herself. She wants you to go alone."

"I haven't seen Paris since I've been grown," said Rosemary. "I'd love to see it with you."

"That's nice of you." Did she imagine that his voice was suddenly metallic? "Of course we've been excited about you from the moment you came on the beach."

"I wanted to know all of you too — especially you. I told you I fell in love with you the ﬁrst time I saw you."

He tried now to make her want to go back to the house and it was difficult, and he did not quite want to lose her. "You don't know what you want. You go and ask your mother what you want."

"I think you're the most wonderful person I ever met — except my mother."

"You have romantic eyes," he laughed.

The guests got into cars, as the Divers stood side by side in the gate. To Rosemary it seemed very hard to drive away and leave them in their house. Again she wondered what Mrs. McKisco had seen in the bathroom.

CHAPTER IV

Rosemary dozed for three hours and then lay awake. She had been brought up with the idea of work. Mrs.

Speers had spent what little was left by her husbands on her daughter's education, and when she blossomed out at sixteen with that extraordinary hair, brought her into a hotel suite of an American producer who was recuperating there. When the producer went to New York they went too. Thus Rosemary had passed her entrance examinations. With the following success and the promise of ﬁnancial stability, Mrs. Speers said tonight:

"You were brought up to work — not to marry. Now you've found your first nut to crack and it's a good nut — go ahead. Hurt yourself or him — whatever happens it can't spoil you because economically you're a boy, not a girl."

Rosemary had never done much thinking, so her mother's words disturbed her sleep. Getting up she walked out on the terrace. Beyond the sea and far up on the hill lived the Divers. She thought of them both together. Their children slept, their gate was shut for the night.

She went along the terrace toward the front door. She stopped at the sight of a ﬁgure seated on the wide white stairway of the entrance — then she saw that it was Luis Campion and that he was weeping. She touched him on the shoulder.

"What is it? Can I help you?" "Nobody can help me. I have only myself to blame. It's always the same."

"What is it — do you want to tell me?"

He looked at her. "No," he decided. She felt sudden disgust with whatever it was.

"Abe North is around here somewhere," Campion said.

"Why, he's staying at the Divers'!" "Yes, but he's up — don't you know what happened? There's going to be a duel."

"Wh-at?"

"A duel with— we don't know what yet."

"Who's going to duel?"

"I'll tell you from the beginning. Of course, you were in the other automobile. Well, in a way you were lucky — It came so suddenly."

"What came?" she demanded.

"I don't know what began it. First she began to talk—"

"Who?"

"Violet McKisco. But don't mention the Divers because he made threats against anybody who mentioned it."

"Who did?"

"Tommy Barban. None of us ever found out what Violet had to say because he kept interrupting her, and then her husband got into it and now, my dear, we have the duel. This morning — at ﬁve o'clock — in an hour."

At that moment Abe North came out of the hotel and saw them.

"What are YOU doing up?" he demanded.

She started to laugh. "I just got up."

Abe sat down beside Rosemary. "Who's going to duel? Is it true?" "It certainly seems to be true."

Abe said the trouble had begun at the time Violet McKisco was telling Mrs. Abrams something she had found out about the Divers — she had gone upstairs in their house and she had come upon something there which had made a great impression on her. But Tommy was a watch-dog about the Divers. He said:

"Mrs. McKisco, please don't talk further about Mrs. Diver."

"I wasn't talking to you," she objected.

"I think it's better to leave them out."

"Are they so sacred?"

"Leave them out. Talk about something else."

The people in the car did not know just what happened until the car stopped and Barban cried in a voice that shook everybody.

"Do you want to get out here — we're only a mile from the hotel and you can walk it. YOU'VE GOT TO SHUT UP AND SHUT YOUR WIFE UP!"

"You know you're stronger muscularly than I am. But I'm not afraid of you — what they ought to have is a duel—" said McKisco.

"Tommy telephoned some man in Cannes to act as second and McKisco telephoned me to come right down. Violet McKisco collapsed and Mrs. Abrams took her to her room. When I got there I tried to argue with Tommy but the latter wouldn't accept anything short of an apology and McKisco wouldn't give it."

When Abe had ﬁnished Rosemary asked thoughtfully:

"Do the Divers know it was about them?"

"No — and they're not ever going to know they had anything to do with it. That damn Campion had no business talking to you about it. This ﬁght's between two men — what Tommy needs is a good war."

Abe looked at his watch.

"I've got to go up and see McKisco — do you want to come?"

After a moment Rosemary agreed and went upstairs beside Abe.

McKisco was sitting on his bed with his alcoholic agression vanished, in spite of the glass of champagne in his hand. He asked:

"Is it time?"

"I don't think you ought to ﬁght a duel," said Rosemary

"Yeah, I should have tried to beat him up, but it's done now. The trouble was I suggested the duel — if Violet had only kept her mouth shut I could have ﬁxed it. Of course even now I can just leave, or sit back and laugh at the whole thing — but I don't think Violet would ever respect me again."

"Yes, she would," said Rosemary. "She'd respect you more."

"No — you don't know Violet. She's very hard when she gets an advantage over you. We've been married twelve years, we had a little girl seven years old and she died and after that you know how it is. We both played around on the side a little, nothing serious but we drifted apart—"

"Well, we'll see there's as little damage done as possible," Abe opened a case. "These are Barban's duelling pistols — I borrowed them so you could get familiar with them."

"How about distance?" asked McKisco.

"I've asked about that. If one or the other parties has to be killed they make it eight paces, if they're just offended it's twenty paces, and if it's only to vindicate their honor it's forty paces. His second agreed with me to make it forty."

"That's good. I don't see what it's all about," he said helplessly. "I don't see why I'm doing it."

It was the ﬁrst thing he had ever done in his life.

"We might as well be going," said Abe.

She found Campion downstairs in the lobby.

"I saw you go upstairs," he said. "Is he all right? When is the duel going to be?"

"I don't know." She resented his speaking of it as a circus, with McKisco as the tragic clown.

"Will you go with me?" he demanded. "I've hired the hotel car."

"I don't want to go." "Why not?"

From the steps downstairs she saw Abe and McKisco drive away — but after a moment the hotel car came around the corner. Luis Campion pulled her in beside him.

"I've got my movie camera, you see."

She laughed helplessly. He was so terrible that he was no longer terrible, only dehumanized.

"I wonder why Mrs. McKisco didn't like the Divers?" she said. "They were very nice to her."

"Oh, it wasn't that. It was something she saw. We never found what it was because of Barban."

They followed the other car, turned off the main road and into the country. "It's the golf course," cried Campion, "I'm sure that's where it's going to be."

He was right.

They saw the two men, Barban and McKisco, face each other. Rosemary felt terrible pity and hatred for Barban; then:

"One — two — three!" Abe counted.

They fired at the same moment. McKisco swayed but recovered himself. Both shots had missed.

"Now, that's enough!" cried Abe. The duellists walked in, and everyone looked at Barban.

"I declare myself unsatisﬁed."

"What? Sure you're satisﬁed," said Abe impatiently. "You just don't know it."

"Your man refuses another shot?" "You're damn right, Tommy. You insisted on this and my client went through with it."

Tommy laughed. "The distance was ridiculous," he said. "Your man must remember he's not now in America."

"This has gone far enough, Tommy," said Abe rather sharply. He turned to McKisco.

"Come on, let's get out."

CHAPTER V

They were at a houseboat café on the Seine, Rosemary, the Norths and the Divers. They had been two days in Paris but actually they were still the same beach company.

The trio of women at the table represented American life. Nicole was the granddaughter of a self-made American capitalist and the granddaughter of a Count of the House of Lippe Weissenfeld. Mary North was the daughter of a paper-hanger and a descendant of President Tyler. Rosemary was from the middle of the middle class, making a career in Hollywood. They were all happy to exist in a man's world — they preserved their individuality through men and not by opposition to them.

Rosemary found it a pleasant party, that luncheon, nicer in that there were only seven people, about the limit of a good party, and after it she and Nicole went to the shops.

Shopping with Nicole, Rosemary spent money she had earned — she was here in Europe due to the fact that she had gone in the canal six times that January day with her temperature rising from 99° in the early morning to 103°, when her mother stopped it.

With Nicole's help Rosemary bought two dresses and two hats and four pairs of shoes with her money. Nicole bought from a great list that ran two pages, and bought the things she saw besides. Everything she liked that she couldn't possibly use herself, she bought as a present for a friend. She bought colored beads, artiﬁcial ﬂowers, honey, a guest bed, bags, scarfs, a doll's house. She bought a dozen bathing suits, a rubber alligator, a travelling chess set of gold and ivory, big handkerchiefs for Abe and two leather jackets. Nicole was the product of much work. For her sake trains ran at Chicago to California; men mixed toothpaste; girls canned tomatoes quickly in August; Indians worked on Brazilian coffee plantations and patent rights for new tractors were stolen from engineers — these were some of the people who worked for Nicole and people like her, and the whole system worked for them.

It was almost four. Nicole stood in a shop and said something about herself, which was so rare.

"Just before the war we were in Berlin — I was thirteen, it was just before Mother died. My sister was going to a court ball and she had three of the royal princes on her dance card. Half an hour before she was going to start she had a side ache and a high fever. The doctor said it was appendicitis and she ought to be operated on. But Mother had her plans made, so Baby went to the ball and danced till two with an ice pack under her evening dress. She was operated on at seven o'clock next morning."

It was good to be hard, then, thought Rosemary. All nice people were hard on themselves.

At eleven that night she sat with Dick and the Norths at a restaurant. Since reaching Paris Abe North had been always stopping in places to get a drink, and she wondered how Mary North liked it. Mary was quiet, so quiet that Rosemary had learned little about her.

"We'll turn in early tonight, Abe, after this drink." Mary's voice was light.

"Oh, no." Abe protested. "Oh, no, not yet. We'll have another bottle of champagne."

"No more for me," said Dick. "It's Rosemary I'm thinking of."

He emptied what was left of the ﬁrst bottle into Rosemary's glass. She had taken nothing with them but now she raised the champagne and drank at it.

"What's this?" exclaimed Dick. "You told me you didn't drink."

"I'm just going to drink this one glass. Besides, yesterday was my birthday — I was eighteen."

"Why didn't you tell us?" they said indignantly.

"I knew you'd make a fuss over it and go to a lot of trouble." She ﬁnished the champagne. "So this is the celebration."

"It most certainly is not," Dick said. "The dinner tomorrow night is your birthday party and don't forget it. Eighteen — why, that's a terribly important age."

"I used to think until you're eighteen nothing matters," said Mary.

"That's right," Abe agreed. "And afterward it's the same way."

"Abe feels that nothing matters till he gets on the boat," said Mary. "He'll be writing music in America and I'll be working as a singer in Munich, so when we get together again there'll be nothing we can't do."

"That's wonderful," agreed Rosemary, feeling the champagne.

Abe said lightly, "Something tells me I'll be a success on Broadway long before you've ﬁnished your scientiﬁc book."

"I hope so," said Dick. "I hope so. I may even give up what you call my ‘scientiﬁc book.'"

"Oh, Dick!" Mary's voice was shocked. Rosemary had never before seen Dick's face so expressionless; she felt that these words were important. Suddenly she was so tired, so drunk that she could stay there no longer. She had to be taken to the hotel at once. Dick insisted on accompanying her.

"What is it you are giving up?" demanded Rosemary, facing Dick in the taxi.

"Nothing of importance." "Are you a scientist?"

"I'm a doctor of medicine."

"Oh-h!" she smiled. "My father was a doctor too. Then why don't you—", she stopped.

"There's no mystery. I'm just not practising. I'll probably practise again some day."

Rosemary put up her face quietly to be kissed. He looked at her for a moment as if he didn't understand.

"Such a lovely child," he said gravely.

She smiled up at him. "I'm in love with you and Nicole. Actually that's my secret — I can't even talk about you to anybody because I don't want any more people to know how wonderful you are. Honestly — I love you and Nicole — I do."

So many times he had heard this — even the formula was the same.

Suddenly she came toward him and he had kissed her breathlessly. Then she lay back against his arm and sighed. "I've decided to give you up," she said.

Dick started — had he said anything to imply that she possessed any part of him?

"But that's very mean," he managed to say lightly, "just when I was getting interested."

"I've loved you so—" As if it had been for years. She was weeping a little now. "I've loved you so-o-o."

Then he should have laughed, but he heard himself saying, "Not only are you beautiful but you are somehow on the grand scale. Everything you do, like pretending to be in love or pretending to be shy gets across."

In the dark taxi, she came close again, clinging to him. He kissed her without enjoying it. He knew that there was passion there, but there was no shadow of it in her eyes or on her mouth; there was a faint spray of champagne on her breath. She clung nearer desperately and once more he kissed her and was chilled by the innocence of her kiss.

Her room in the hotel was diagonally across from theirs. When they reached the door she said suddenly:

"I know you don't love me — I don't expect it. Well, for my birthday present I want you to come into my room a minute while I tell you something. Just one minute."

They went in and he closed the door, and Rosemary stood close to him, not touching him. The night had drawn the color from her face — she was very pale. She came close up against him.

"Take me."

"Take you where?"

He was frozen with astonishment. "Go on," she whispered. "Oh, please go on. I don't care if I don't like it — I never expected to — I've always hated to think about it but now I don't. I want you to."

She was astonished at herself — she had never imagined she could talk like that. Suddenly she knew too that it was one of her greatest roles.

"Isn't it just the champagne? Let's more or less forget it," said Dick.

"Oh, no, NOW. I want you to do it now, take me, show me, I'm absolutely yours and I want to be."

"For one thing, have you thought how much it would hurt Nicole?"

"She won't know — this won't have anything to do with her."

He continued kindly.

"Then there's the fact that I love Nicole."

"But you can love more than just one person, can't you? Like I love Mother and I love you — more. I love you more now."

"—you're not in love with me but you might be afterwards, and that would begin your life with a terrible mess."

"No, I promise I'll never see you again. I'll get Mother and go to America right away."

He took another tone. "You're just in that mood."

"Oh, please, I don't care even if I had a baby. I could go into Mexico like a girl at the studio. Oh, this is so different from anything I ever thought — I used to hate it when they kissed me seriously." He saw she was still under the impression that it must happen. "Some of them had great big teeth, but you're all different and beautiful. I want you to do it. I know you're not in love with me." She was suddenly humble and quiet. "I didn't expect that much. I know I must seem just nothing to you."

"Nonsense. But you seem young to me."

Rosemary waited till Dick said, "And lastly things aren't arranged so that this could be as you want."

He followed her to the bed, and sat down beside her while she wept. He was suddenly confused and for a moment his usual grace was absent.

"I knew you wouldn't," she sobbed. He stood up.

"Good night, child. Let's forget it. So many people are going to love you and it might be nice to meet your ﬁrst love intact, emotionally too. That's an old-fashioned idea, isn't it?" She looked up at him as he walked towards the door. When it closed behind him, she got up and went to the mirror, and began to brush her hair, sniffling a little.

CHAPTER VI

She woke up cooled and shamed. The sight of her beauty in the mirror did not reassure her and a letter, sent by her mother, from the boy who had taken her to a Yale party last fall, which announced his presence in Paris was no help — all that seemed far away. She left her room to meet the Divers. She and Nicole had arranged it to go shopping together. She admired Nicole for her beauty and her wisdom, and also for the ﬁrst time in her life she was jealous. In the taxi she looked at Nicole, matching herself against her. "We lived there," Rosemary suddenly pointed to a building in the Rue des Saints-Péres.

"That's strange. Because when I was twelve Mother and Baby and I once spent a winter there," and Nicole pointed to a hotel directly across the street. "We'd just built our Lake Forest house and we were economizing. At least Baby and I and the governess economized and Mother travelled."

"We were economizing too," said Rosemary, realizing that the word meant different things to them.

"Mother always spoke of it very carefully as a small hotel —" Nicole gave her quick magnetic little laugh, "— I mean instead of saying a ‘cheap' hotel. If any friends asked us our address we'd never say, ‘We're in a dingy little hole where we're glad of running water,' — we'd say ‘We're in a small hotel.' As if all the big ones were too noisy and vulgar for us. Of course the friends always saw through us and told everyone about it, but Mother always said it showed we knew our way around Europe. She did, of course: she was born a German citizen. But her mother was American, and she was brought up in Chicago, and she was more American than European."

They were meeting the others in two minutes for lunch in the Norths' already empty apartment. The day seemed different to Rosemary from the day before. When she saw Dick face to face, their eyes met. After that everything was all right, everything was wonderful, she knew that he was beginning to fall in love with her. She felt wildly happy. She scarcely looked at him but she knew everything was all right.

After luncheon the Divers and the Norths and Rosemary went to the Franco-American Films, to be joined by Collis Clay, her young man from New Haven, to whom she had telephoned.

In the projection room she sat between Collis Clay and Dick. Then the lights went out, and she was alone with Dick at last. They looked at each other in the half darkness.

"Dear Rosemary," he murmured.

Their shoulders touched.

There she was — the school girl of a year ago, hair down her back; there she was — SO young and innocent — the product of her mother's loving care. Daddy's girl. Rosemary triumphed.

Her ﬁneness of character, her courage and steadfastness intruded upon by the vulgarity of the world — it was so moving that the emotions of the whole row of people went out to her at intervals during the picture. There was a break once and the light went on and after the chatter of applause Dick said to her sincerely: "I'm simply astounded. You're going to be one of the best actresses on the stage."

In the taxi with Dick and Collis Clay — they were dropping Collis, and Dick was taking Rosemary to a tea party to which Nicole and the Norths did not want to go — Collis said:

"That's a great picture. I've seen it four times. I know one boy at New Haven who's seen it a dozen times — he went all the way to Hartford to see it one time. And when I brought Rosemary up to New Haven he was so shy he wouldn't meet her. Can you beat that?"

Dick and Rosemary looked at each other, wanting to be alone, but Collis failed to understand.

"I'll drop you where you're going," he suggested. "I'm staying at the Lutetia."

"We'll drop you," said Dick.

"It'll be easier for me to drop you.9

No trouble at all."

"I think it will be better if we drop you."

After he was ﬁnally gone, they were left alone.

"I don't know what came over me last night," Rosemary said. "That glass of champagne? I've never done anything like that before."

"You simply said you loved me."

"I do love you — I can't change that." It was time for Rosemary to cry, so she cried a little in her handkerchief.

"I'm afraid I'm in love with you," said Dick, "and that's not the best thing that could happen."

They stopped thinking with an almost painful relief, stopped seeing; they only breathed and sought each other. They were still in the happier stage of love. They were full of brave illusions about each other, tremendous illusions, no other human relations mattered.

But for Dick that portion of the road was short.

"There's nothing to do about it," he said, with a feeling of panic. "I'm in love with you but it doesn't change what I said last night."

"That doesn't matter now. I just wanted to make you love me — if you love me everything's all right."

"Unfortunately I do. But Nicole mustn't know — she mustn't suspect even faintly. Nicole and I have got to go on together. In a way that's more important than just wanting to go on."

"Kiss me once more."

He kissed her, but then momentarily left her.

"Nicole mustn't suffer — she loves me and I love her — you understand that."

She did understand — it was the sort of thing she understood well, not hurting people. She knew the Divers loved each other because it had been her primary assumption. She had thought however that it was a rather cooled relation, and actually rather like the love of herself and her mother.

"And I mean love," he said, guessing her thoughts. "Active love — it's more complicated than I can tell you. It was responsible for that crazy duel." "How did you know about the duel?

I thought we were to keep it from you."

"Do you think Abe can keep a secret?" He spoke with irony. "Tell a secret over the radio, publish it in a tabloid, but never tell it to a man who drinks more than three or four a day."

She laughed in agreement, staying close to him.

"So you understand my relations with Nicole are complicated. She's not very strong — she looks strong but she isn't. And this makes rather a mess."

"Oh, say that later! But kiss me now — love me now. I'll love you and never let Nicole see."

"You darling."

They reached the hotel after the tea party, and Rosemary walked a little behind him, to admire him, to adore him. His step was alert as if he had just come from some great doings and was hurrying on toward others.

They walked upstairs — ﬁve ﬂights. At the ﬁrst landing they stopped and kissed; she was careful on the next landing, on the third more careful still. On the next — there were two more — she stopped half way and kissed him goodby. At his urgency she walked down with him to the one below for a minute — and then up and up. Dick went back downstairs to make some arrangements for the evening — Rosemary ran to her room and wrote a letter to her mother; she was conscience-stricken because she did not miss her mother at all.

The party that night was an absolute success. Everything had been foreseen. People joined them as if by magic. There was, among many things, the car of the Shah of Persia. Where Dick had got it was unknown. Rosemary accepted it as a fact. The car had been built on a special chassis in America. Its wheels were of silver, so was the radiator. The inside of the body was inlaid with innumerable brilliants which would be replaced with true gems by the court jeweller when the car arrived in Teheran the following week. There was only one real seat in the back, because the Shah must ride alone, so they took turns riding in it and sitting on the ﬂoor.

But always there was Dick. Never had she known any one so nice, so thoroughly nice as Dick was that night. She compared him with all other men at the party — and felt there was no comparison.

Afterward she remembered the times when she had felt the happiest. The ﬁrst time was when she and Dick danced together and she felt her beauty sparkling bright against his tall, strong form. There was a moment when they were not dancing at all, simply clinging together.

Later, when six of them, stood in the front lobby of the Ritz, Mary said suddenly:

"That's enough. I've got to get Abe home. His boat train leaves at eleven. It's so important — I feel the whole future depends on his catching it, but whenever I argue with him he does the exact opposite."

"I'll try and persuade him," offered Rosemary.

"Would you?" Mary said doubtfully. "Maybe you could."

Then Dick came up to Rosemary: "Nicole and I are going home and we thought you'd want to go with us." "I can't," she said. "I promised Mary North to stay along with them — or

Abe'll never go to bed."

"Don't you know you can't do anything about people?" he advised her. "If Abe was my roommate in college, drunk for the ﬁrst time, it'd be different. Now there's nothing to do."

"Well, I've got to stay,"' she said.

He kissed the inside of her elbow quickly.

CHAPTER VII

Abe left from the Gare Saint Lazare at eleven — he stood alone under the glass dome, relic of the seventies, era of the Crystal Palace; his hands, of that gray color that only twenty-four hours can produce, were in his coat pockets to conceal the trembling ﬁngers. He was scarcely recognizable as the man who had swum upon Gausse's Beach a fortnight ago.

He was early; he looked from left to right with his eyes only; he could not use any other part of his body.

At the minute when he wondered whether or not he had time for a drink at the buffet, he saw Nicole at the stairs. He watched her.

When she saw Abe, they sat down on a bench.

"I came because you asked me," said Nicole. Abe seemed to have forgotten why he asked her and Nicole was quite content to look at the travellers passing by.

"I'm tired of you both, but it doesn't show because you're even more tired of me — you know what I mean. If I had any enthusiasm, I'd go on to new people," Abe said.

Nicole slapped him with her velvet gloves.

"Seems rather foolish to be unpleasant, Abe. Anyhow you don't mean that. I can't see why you've given up everything."

Abe considered.

"I suppose I got bored; and then it was such a long way to go back in order to get anywhere."

Often a man can play the helpless child in front of a woman, but he can almost never bring it off when he feels like a helpless child.

Abe was feeling worse every minute — he could think of nothing but unkind nervous remarks. For a while there was no communication between them. Unlike lovers they had no past; unlike man and wife, they had no future; yet up to this morning Nicole had liked Abe better than any one except Dick — and he had been heavy with love for her for years.

Abe remarked:

"Trouble is when you're sober you don't want to see anybody, and when you're drunk nobody wants to see you."

"Who, me?" Nicole laughed. "No — me."

Rosemary and Mary North came in sight, walking slowly and searching for Abe, and Nicole shouted "Hey! Hi! Hey!" and laughed and waved the package of handkerchiefs she had bought for Abe.

They stood in an uncomfortable group made little by Abe's gigantic presence. They were frightened at his will, once a will to live, now a will to die.

Dick Diver came and brought with him relief for the three women.

The train began to move. Abe waved from his window.

He saw Rosemary for the ﬁrst time that morning. They exchanged glances. For a moment each seemed unreal to the other — then the slow warmth of love began again.

He saw, not without panic, that the affair could not stand still, it must go on or go back; for the ﬁrst time it occurred to him that Rosemary was more in control than he.

However, everything that had happened — Abe's departure and Mary's coming departure for Salzburg this afternoon had ended the time in Paris. During their luncheon, outdoors, across from the Luxembourg Gardens, Rosemary had cramps and felt unhappy.

After Mary North left them, accompanied by the Italian singing teacher who had joined them for coffee and was taking her to her train, Rosemary stood up, as she was having an engagement at her studio: "to meet some ofﬁcials."

"And oh—" she said "—if Collis Clay comes while you are still sitting here, just tell him I couldn't wait; tell him to call me to-morrow."

Dick asked for the check; the Divers relaxed.

"Well—" they said together.

What did Nicole think? Rosemary was one of a dozen people he had attracted in the past years: these had included a French circus clown, Abe and Mary North, a pair of dancers, a writer, a painter, a half-crazy pederast from the Russian Ballet, a promising tenor. Nicole well knew how seriously these people interpreted his interest and enthusiasm; but she realized also that, except while their children were being born, Dick had not spent a night apart from her since their marriage. Collis Clay appeared between the tables and greeted the Divers. Nicole left almost immediately and he sat with Collis, ﬁnishing the last of his wine. Dick rather liked Collis — he was "postwar"; less difﬁcult than most of the young men he had known at New Haven a decade before. Dick listened to him with amusement. Suddenly his blood ran cold as he realized the content of Collis's monologue.

"—she's not so cold as you'd probably think. I admit I thought she was cold for a long time. But she got into a jam with a friend of mine going from New York to Chicago at Easter — a boy named Hillis — she had a compartment with a cousin of mine but she and Hillis wanted to be alone, so in the afternoon my cousin came and played cards in our compartment. Well, after about two hours we went back and there was Rosemary and Bill Hillis standing in the vestibule arguing with the conductor — Rosemary white as a sheet. Seems they locked the door and pulled down the blinds and I guess there was something going on when the conductor came for the tickets and knocked on the door. They thought it was us kidding them and wouldn't let him in at ﬁrst, and when they did, he was plenty sore. He asked Hillis if that was his compartment and whether he and Rosemary were married that they locked the door, and Hillis lost his temper trying to explain there was nothing wrong. He said the conductor had insulted Rosemary and believe me I had an awful time smoothing it over."

With every detail imagined, Dick felt a change taking place within him. Only the image of a third person, even in the past, threw him off his balance and sent through him waves of pain and desire.

He had guessed that Collis Clay was in love with Rosemary in some curious way Dick could not understand. The affair with Hillis seemed to have made no emotional impression on Collis.

... Dick went over Paris to his bank, and while there, came up to the mail desk. There was a bill for seventeen psychiatric books, a letter from Buffalo from his father, in a handwriting that year by year became more indecipherable; there was a card from Tommy Barban; there were letters from doctors in Zurich; a bill from a furniture maker; also there were three letters for Nicole, and a letter for Rosemary sent in his care.

As he left the bank, he got into a taxi waiting outside.

"I want to go to the Films Par Excellence Studio — it's on a little street in Passy."

The events of the last forty-eight hours had made him so uncertain that he was not even sure of what he wanted to do; he paid off the taxi and walked in the direction of the studio. He knew that what he was now doing was out of line with everything that had been before it — his walking around this block was not proper.

After three-quarters of an hour of standing around, it became clear that he had missed Rosemary. He went into the bistro on the corner and called the hotel. After a long while a little voice said hello.

"This is Dick — I had to call you."

A pause from her — then: "I'm glad you did."

"I came to meet you at your studio — I'm in Passy. I thought maybe we'd ride somewhere."

"Oh, I only stayed there a minute!

I'm so sorry." A silence. "Rosemary."

"Yes, Dick." "Are you alone?"

"Who do you think I'd be with?" "I'd like to be with you now." Silence, then a sigh and an answer.

"I wish you were with me now.17"

There was the hotel room where she lay behind a telephone number, and there was music around her —

"And two — for tea. And me for you, And you for me Alow-own."

"It's impossible," he said to himself. In a minute he was out in the street.

Rosemary returned to her desk and ﬁnished a letter to her mother.

"—I only saw him for a little while but I thought he was wonderful looking. I fell in love with him (Of course I Do Love Dick Best but you know what I mean). He really is going to direct the picture and is leaving immediately for Hollywood, and I think we ought to leave, too. Collis Clay has been here. I like him all right but have not seen much of him because of the Divers, who really are the Nicest People I Have Ever Known. Are you coming north or shall I come south with the Divers?"

CHAPTER VIII

Nicole awoke late. Dick's bed was empty — only after a minute did she realize that she had been awakened by a knock at their door.

"Entrez!" she called, but there was no answer, and after a moment she went to open it. A gendarme faced her and stepped inside the door.

"Mr. North — he is here?" "What? No — he's gone to America."

"When did he leave, Madame?" "Yesterday morning."

He shook his head.

"He was in Paris last night. He is registered here but his room is not occupied. They told me I had better ask at this room."

"We saw him off yesterday morning on the train."

"He has been seen here this morning.3"

"We know nothing about it," she said in amazement.

He considered. He was an ill-smelling, handsome man.

"You were not with him at all last night?"

"No."

"We have arrested a Negro. We are convinced we have at last arrested the correct Negro."

"I assure you that I haven't an idea what you're talking about. If it's Mr. Abraham North, well, if he was in Paris last night we didn't know it."

The man nodded, convinced but disappointed.

"What happened?" Nicole demanded.

"Mr. North was robbed and he made a complaint. We have arrested a Negro. Mr. Afghan should come to identify him."

After the gendarme left, Nicole took a bath and dressed. She phoned the hotel office and found that Abe had indeed registered at six-thirty this morning. His room, however, was still unoccupied. Just as she decided to go out, the ofﬁce called and announced:

"Mr Crawshow, a Negro."

"On what business?" she demanded. "He says he knows you and the doctor. He says there is a Mr Freeman in prison. He says there is injustice and he wishes to see Mr North before he himself is arrested5."

"We know nothing about it." Abe's reappearance made it clear to her how tired she was of his adventures. Thinking no more of him she went out, ran into Rosemary at the dressmaker's, and shopped with her on the Rue de Rivoli.

When they got back to the hotel and found Dick, they learned that he had just received a call from Abe who had spent the morning in hiding.6

Abe had said: "Dick, I've started a race riot in Montmartre. I'm going to get Freeman out of prison. If a Negro that makes shoe polish — well, if anybody comes there—"

"Why you back in Paris?" Dick demanded.

"I got as far as Evreux, and I decided to take a plane back— For God's sake, wait a minute and I'll put— Listen, did Mary get off all right?"

"Yes."

"Dick, I want you to talk with a man I met here this morning, the son of a naval ofﬁcer that's been to every doctor in Europe. Let me tell you about him —"

Dick put down the receiver.

"Abe used to be so nice," Nicole told Rosemary. "So nice. Long ago — when Dick and I were ﬁrst married. If you had known him then. He'd come to stay with us for weeks and weeks and we scarcely knew he was in the house."

Rosemary envied them, imagining a life of leisure unlike her own. She knew little of leisure but she had the respect for it of those who have never had it.

"Why does he have to drink?" she asked.

Nicole shook her head right and left: "So many smart men go to pieces nowadays."

The trio lunched downstairs. There was a party at the next table. It consisted of a young man, and a dozen of women. The women were neither young nor old nor of any particular social class; yet the party gave the impression of a unit, held more closely together for example than a group of wives of husbands who had come to a professional congress of their husbands or than any conceivable tourist party.

Dick asked the waiter to ﬁnd out who they were.

"Those are the gold-star mothers," explained the waiter.

Rosemary's eyes ﬁlled with tears. "Probably the young ones are the wives," said Nicole.

Over his wine Dick looked at them again; in their faces, he saw the maturity of an older America. For a while the women who had come to mourn for their dead, for something they could not repair, made the room beautiful.

Abe North was still in the Ritz bar, where he had been since nine in the morning. When he arrived the famous barman Paul, who liked Abe, came over to talk.

"I was supposed to ship home this morning," Abe said. "I mean yesterday morning."

"Why didn't you?" asked Paul.

Abe considered to find reason: "I was reading a serial in Liberty and the next installment was due here in Paris — so if I'd sailed I'd have missed it — then I never would have read it."

Paul chuckled and paused, leaning on the back of a chair:

"If you really want to get off, Mr. North, there are friends of yours going to-morrow on the France — Mr Pearson and Mr Yardly. They're both going on the France."

Abe grew rather enthusiastic about being cared for.15

At four the bell-boy approached him:

"You wish to see a colored fellow of the name Jules Peterson?"

"God! How did he ﬁnd me?"

"I didn't tell him you were present." "Who did?"

Abe got himself up with an effort and went out.

At two o'clock Rosemary opened her door. When Dick knocked and she opened the door she saw him as something Godlike.

She came over and sat on the bed, he sat near her. She kissed him several times in the mouth, and he thought of his responsibility about Nicole two doors across the corridor.

There was a knocking at the door. They were shocked motionless; the knock was repeated, and suddenly realizing that the door was not locked Rosemary started for the door, while Dick quickly jerked the wrinkles out of the bed where they had been sitting.

Standing there was Abe, aged by several months in the last twentyfour hours, and a very frightened colored man whom Abe introduced as Mr. Peterson of Stockholm.

"He's in a terrible situation and it's my fault," said Abe. "We need some good advice."

"Come in our rooms," said Dick.

Abe insisted that Rosemary come too and they crossed the hall to the Divers' suite. Jules Peterson, a small, respectable Negro, followed.

It appeared that the latter had been a legal witness to the early morning dispute in Montparnasse; he had accompanied Abe to the police station and supported his words that a thousand franc note had been seized out of his hand by a Negro. Abe and Jules Peterson with an agent of police, returned to the bistro and too hastily identiﬁed as the criminal a Negro, who, so it was established after an hour, had only entered the place after Abe left. The police had further complicated the situation by arresting the well-known Negro restaurateur, Freeman, who had also been there. The true criminal had only recently reappeared upon the scene. In brief, Abe had in an hour entangled himself with the personal lives and emotions of one Afro-European and three Afro-Americans from the

French Latin quarter.

Abe had evaded all of them, save Jules Peterson. Peterson was rather in the position of the friendly Indian who had helped a white. The Negroes who suffered from the betrayal were not so much after Abe as after Peterson, and Peterson was very much frightened.

Dick looked at him and turned to Abe:

"You go to some hotel and go to bed. After you feel better Mr. Peterson will come and see you."

"I shall wait in the hall," said Mr. Peterson with delicacy. "It is perhaps hard to discuss my problems in front of me."

He left the room quietly; Abe got to his feet.

"I don't seem highly popular today."

With a last desperate glance at Rosemary, he went out. To his relief Peterson was no longer in the corridor. Feeling homeless he went back to ask Paul the name of that boat.

When he had gone out, Dick and Rosemary embraced. Rosemary was ﬁrst to return to reality.

"I must go," she said.

She opened the door of her room and realized without looking about that she was not alone in the room. She saw that a dead Negro was stretched upon her bed.

As she cried "aaouu!", she ran for the door and across the hall.

"DICK! DICK! Come and see!"

Dick ran across the hall into her room. He felt Peterson's pulse — the body was warm, the face was bitter in death. By French law Dick had no right to touch the body but he moved the arm a little to see something — there was a stain on the green coverlet, there might be blood on the blanket under it.

Dick closed the door and stood thinking; he heard steps in the corridor and then Nicole calling him by name. Opening the door he whispered: "Bring the coverlet and top blanket from one of our beds — don't let any one see you." He added quickly, "Look here, you mustn't get upset over this — it's only some negro ﬁght."

The body, as Dick lifted it, was light. Laying it beside the bed he stripped off the coverlet and top blanket and then opening the door an inch, listened. Quickly Dick and Nicole exchanged bundles across the corridor; after putting this coverlet on Rosemary's bed, Dick stood thinking. He thought ﬁrst that Abe's hostile Indian had found the friendly Indian and discovered him in the corridor, and when the latter had hidden in Rosemary's room, had followed and killed him; second, that if the situation were allowed to develop naturally, no power on earth could save Rosemary's reputation. Under her contract she was to remain "Daddy's Girl."

He dragged the body into the corridor. Then he went to the phone and called the manager-owner of the hotel. "McBeth? — it's Doctor Diver speaking — something very important." It was good that he had made the extra effort to make friends with Mr. McBeth. Here was one use for all the charm that Dick had spread over lots of people.

"Going out of the suite we came on a dead Negro ... in the hall ... Wait a minute now — I knew you didn't want any guests to see the body so I'm phoning you. Of course I must ask you to keep my name out of it. I don't want any French red tape just because I discovered the man."

What consideration for the hotel! Only because Mr. McBeth, with his own eyes, had seen it in Doctor Diver two nights before, could he believe the story without question.

In a minute Mr. McBeth arrived and in another minute he was joined by a gendarme. In the interval he found time to whisper to Dick, "You can be sure the name of any guest will be protected. I'm only too grateful to you for what you did."

Mr. McBeth took an immediate step that may only be imagined, but that inﬂuenced the gendarme. He made notes and sent a telephone call to his post.

Dick went back to his suite.

"What HAP-pened?" cried Rosemary.

"Where's Nicole?"

"I think she's in the bathroom." He went to the bathroom. And now

Rosemary, too, could hear, louder and louder, some strange sounds.

With the idea that Nicole had fallen in the bathroom and hurt herself, Rosemary followed Dick. She saw Nicole kneeling beside the tub and swaying. "It's you!" she cried, "—it's you come to intrude on the only privacy I have in the world — with the coverlet with red blood on it. I'll wear it for you — I'm not ashamed. On All Fools Day we had a party on the Zurichsee, and all the fools were there, and I wanted to come dressed in a coverlet but they wouldn't let me—"

"Control yourself!"

"—so I sat in the bathroom. What else could I do?"

"Control yourself, Nicole!"

"I never expected you to love me — it was too late — only don't come in the bathroom, the only place I can go for privacy. Don't bring me coverlets with red blood on them and don't ask me to wash them."

"Control yourself. Get up—"

Rosemary stood trembling: now she knew what Violet McKisco had seen in the bathroom at Villa Diana.

BOOK 2

CHAPTER I

In the spring of 1917, when Doctor Richard Diver ﬁrst arrived in Zurich, he was twenty-six years old, a ﬁne age for a man, indeed the very acme of bachelorhood. Even in wartime days, it was a fine age for Dick, who was already too valuable, too much of a capital investment to be shot off on the front. Instructions from his military authorities were that he was to complete his studies in Zurich and take a degree as he had planned.

Switzerland was an island, washed on all sides by the waves of war.

Doctor Diver had been to Oxford in 1914. He returned home for a final year at Johns Hopkins University, and took his degree. In 1916 he managed to get to Vienna under the impression that, if he were not in a hurry, the great Freud would be killed by an aeroplane bomb. Dick managed to get enough coal and oil to sit in his room in the Damenstiff Strasse and write a book that he published in Zurich in 1920.

He had no idea that he was charming. In his last year at New Haven some one referred to him as "lucky Dick".

At the beginning of 1917, when it was becoming difficult to find coal,

Dick burned for fuel almost a hundred textbooks that he had collected; but he remembered what was within them very well.

After he took his degree, he received his orders to join a neurological unit forming in Bar-sur-Aube.

In France, he found time to complete the short textbook and collect the material for his next book. He returned to Zurich in the spring of 1919 discharged.

He had decided to remain another two years in Zurich. To-day he went out to see Franz Gregorovius at Dohmler's clinic on the Zurichsee. Franz, resident pathologist at the clinic, a few years older than Dick, met him at the tram stop. On the way to the clinic he asked: "Did you come down to see me or that girl?"

"Is she well?" Dick demanded.

"Perfectly well, I have charge of her, in fact I have charge of the majority of the English and American patients. They call me Doctor Gregory." "Let me explain about that girl," Dick said. "I only saw her one time. When I came to say good-by to you just before I went over to France. It was the ﬁrst time I put on my uniform. When I left you I saw a nurse and a young girl. I didn't think the girl was a patient; I asked the nurse about tram times and we walked along. The girl was the prettiest thing I ever saw." "She still is."

"She'd never seen an American uniform and we talked, and I didn't think anything about it. That was absolutely all — till the letters began to come."

"It was the best thing that could have happened to her," said Franz. "I want you to come into my ofﬁce and talk before you see her."

Dick thought of the patient, the girl.

He had received about ﬁfty letters from her written over a period of eight months. He wanted to know more about her; and Franz told Dick the story.

About a year and a half before, Doctor Dohmler had a letter from an American gentleman living in Lausanne, a Mr. Devereux Warren, of the Warren family of Chicago. A meeting was arranged and one day Mr. Warren arrived at the clinic with his daughter Nicole, a girl of sixteen. She was obviously not well.

Warren was a very handsome man looking less than forty. He was a ﬁne American type in every way, tall, broad, well-made. He was nervous.

"Doctor Dohmler, my daughter isn't right in the head. I've had lots of specialists and nurses for her but the thing has grown too big for me and I've been strongly recommended to come to you."

"Very well," said Doctor Dohmler. "Please start at the beginning and tell me everything."

"There isn't any beginning, at least there isn't any insanity in the family that I know of, on either side. Nicole's mother died when she was eleven and I've been father and mother to her, with the help of governesses.

As a child she was a darling thing — everybody was crazy about her. She liked to read or draw or dance or play the piano. I've got an older girl, too, and there was a boy that died, but Nicole was—"

He broke off and Doctor Dohmler helped him.

"She was a perfectly normal, happy child."

"Perfectly."

Doctor Dohmler waited. Mr. Warren shook his head, blew a long sigh, glanced quickly at Doctor Dohmler and then at the ﬂoor again.

"About eight months ago, or maybe it was six months ago she began to do funny things — crazy things."

All the time Warren was talking to Doctor Dohmler, latter kept thinking of Chicago. Once in his younger days he had lived in Chicago as fellow and docent at the university. He knew Chicago great feudal families of Armour, Palmer, Field, Crane, Warren, Swift, and McCormick and many others.

"She got worse," continued Warren. "She had a fit or something — the things she said got crazier and crazier. Almost always about men going to attack her, men she knew or men on the street— anybody—"

He told of the efforts they had made in America, ﬁnally of his decision to bring his daughter to Switzerland.

Dohmler was wondering why and about what the man was lying to him. Doctor Dohmler asked him questions and pressed and pressed, until half an hour later Warren broke down.

"It just happened," he said. "I don't know."

"After her mother died when she was little she used to come into my bed every morning, sometimes she'd sleep in my bed. I was sorry for the little thing. People used to say what a wonderful father and daughter we were. We were just like lovers — and then all at once we were lovers — and ten minutes after it happened I could have shot myself."

"Then what?" said Doctor Dohmler. "Did this thing go on?"

"Oh, no! She seemed to freeze up right away. She'd just say, ‘Never mind, never mind, Daddy. It doesn't matter. Never mind.'"

When Warren had left his daughter and returned to Lausanne, and several days had passed, the doctor and Franz entered upon Nicole's card:

Diagnosis: Divided Personality. Acute phase of the illness. The fear of men is a symptom of the illness. The prognosis must be reserved.

"The prognosis was bad — as you know, the percentage of cures is very low at that age."

"Those first letters looked bad," agreed Dick.

"Very bad — very typical. I didn't want to let the ﬁrst one get out of the clinic. It was nice of you to answer them."

Dick sighed. "She was such a pretty thing. All I said in my letters was ‘Be a good girl and mind the doctors.'" "That was enough — it gave her somebody to think of outside. For a while she didn't have anybody — only one sister that she doesn't seem very close to. Besides, reading her letters helped us here — they revealed her condition. About October she began to seem normal."

When Dick ﬁrst visited Miss Warren at the clinic, she met him at the veranda of the central building.

"How do you do, Captain," she said. "Shall we sit out here? It's summer practically. Are you here for a long time?"

"I'm in Zurich for a long time, if that's what you mean. At least till July."

"I'm leaving in June.15"

"You're going where?" Dick asked Nicole.

"Somewhere with my sister — somewhere exciting, I hope, because I've lost so much time. But perhaps they'll think I ought to go to a quiet place at ﬁrst."

They talked of music, of the latest records. Whenever he turned toward her she was smiling a little, her face lighting up like an angel's. She thanked him for everything, rather as if he had taken her to some party, and as Dick became less and less certain of his relation to her, her conﬁdence increased.

CHAPTER II

It was May when he next saw her at luncheon in Zurich. The logic of his life tended away from the girl.

He was enough older than Nicole to take pleasure in her delights, the way she paused in front of the hall mirror on leaving the restaurant. He was glad to see her build up happiness and conﬁdence. The difﬁculty was that Nicole brought everything to his feet. "How about our patient?" Franz asked one day, when they were sitting at his place and drinking beer. "I don't know."

"Well, you should know about her by now."

"I like her. She's attractive. What do you want me to do — devote my life to her?'

"We think it's best to have a program. Four weeks have passed away — apparently the girl is in love with you. That's not our business if we were in the world, but here in the clinic it is." "I'll do whatever Doctor Dohmler says," Dick agreed.

This was repeated when he and Franz went together to Professor Dohmler's ofﬁce.

"We have gone a certain way," Professor Dohmler said. "It's you, Doctor Diver, who can best help us now.

I realize that your position has been difﬁcult."

"Yes, it has."

Now the professor sat back and laughed: "Perhaps you have got sentimentally involved yourself. She's a pretty girl— Have you thought of going away?"

"I can't go away."

Doctor Dohmler turned to Franz: "Then we can send Miss Warren away." "As you think best, Professor Dohmler," Dick agreed. "It's certainly a situation."

"But it is a professional situation," Professor Dohmler cried.

When the storm was over, Franz managed to get his word in.

"Doctor Diver is a man of fine character," he said. "Dick can co-operate right here, without any one going away."

"How do you feel about that?" Professor Dohmler asked Dick.

"I'm half in love with her — the question of marrying her has passed through my mind."

Franz cried: "What! And devote half your life to being doctor and nurse and all — never! I know what these cases are. One time in twenty it doesn't return — better never see her again!" "What do you think?" Dohmler asked Dick.

"Of course Franz is right."

It was late afternoon when they ﬁnished the discussion as to what Dick should do, he must be kind and yet eliminate his presence in her life. He went out and came upon her immediately.

She said: "When I was ill I didn't mind sitting inside with the others in the evening— Naturally now I see them as ill—"

"You'll be leaving soon.8"

"Oh, yes. My sister, Beth, but she's always been called Baby, she's coming in a few weeks to take me somewhere; after that I'll be back here for a last month."

"The older sister?"

"Oh, quite a bit older. She's twenty-four — she's very English. She lives in London with my father's sister. She was engaged to an Englishman but he was killed—"

Her face had a promise Dick had never seen before: the face would be handsome in middle life; it would be handsome in old age: the essential structure and the economy were there. "You're well," he said. "Try to forget the past. Go back to America and fall in love — and be happy." "I couldn't fall in love."

"Sure you can," Dick insisted. "Not for a year maybe, but sooner or later. You can have a perfectly normal life with children."

There was a look of pain in her eyes as she heard his words.

"I know I won't be able to marry any one for a long time," she said humbly.

Dick was too upset to say any more.11

Nicole's world had fallen to pieces. Was it an hour ago she had waited by the entrance, looking into future with hope? For a moment she had a desperate idea of telling him how rich she was, what big houses she lived in. But she did not, even though there was no home left to her, save emptiness and pain.

"I have to go back to the clinic." He expected to hear from Nicole next day but there was no word. Wondering if she was ill, he called the clinic and talked to Franz.

"She came downstairs to luncheon yesterday and to-day," said Franz. "She seemed a little in the clouds. How did it go off?"

"I tried to be distant, but I didn't think enough happened to change her attitude."

"From some things she said to her nurse I'm inclined to think she understood," said Franz.

During the next weeks Dick felt dissatisﬁed. Nicole's emotions had been used unfairly — what if it had happened to him?

He realized how far his emotions were involved; and he provided antidotes. One was the telephone girl from Bar-sur-Aube; another was making arrangements to get home in August; a third was intensiﬁcation of work on his book that this autumn was to be presented to the German-speaking world of psychiatry.

He had projected a new work: An Attempt at a Uniform and Pragmatic Classification of the Neuroses and Psychoses, Based on an Examination of Fifteen Hundred Cases.

Having planned a short holiday in the mountains, he arrived at the station of the Glion funicular, and after a short wait got into a car.

When Chillon came into view, suddenly there was a confusion among passengers — they parted to give way to a couple of young people — a young man and Nicole.

Nicole said, "Hel-LO." She was lovely to look at; immediately Dick saw that something was different; one could not believe she had been to the clinic.

"Doctor Diver, the Conte de Marmora," she introduced them. "Sister in ﬁrst-class — it's a matter of principle with her." Nicole and Marmora laughed.

"Where are you going?" asked Dick. "Caux. You too?" Nicole looked at his costume.

"Yes. I'm going down Monday." Dick wished himself away from her, fearing that he reminded her of a world well left behind. He decided to go to the other hotel.

When they arrived, Nicole was beside him.

"Aren't you at our hotel?" she asked. "I'm economizing."

 the Conte de Marmora — граф де Мармора

"Will you come down and have dinner?" A crowd passed them.

"This is my sister— Doctor Diver from Zurich." Dick bowed to a young woman of twenty-ﬁve, tall and conﬁdent.

"I'll drop in after dinner," Dick promised.

He left, feeling Nicole's eyes following him, feeling her helpless ﬁrst love.

They were waiting for him at the hotel. Baby Warren wanted to talk to Dick: "Nicole told me that you had a lot to do with her getting well. What I can't understand is what WE should do — they only told me she ought to be natural and gay. But how can I tell what's normal and what's crazy?"

"Nicole isn't going to be crazy, you needn't be afraid.20"

"I don't mind the responsibility but we've never had anything like this in the family before," she declared. "Actually I have a plan. They say Nicole will need to be looked after for a few years. I don't know whether you know Chicago or not—"

"I don't."

"Well, there's a North Side and a South Side. The North Side is chic and all that, and we've always lived over there, but lots of old Chicago families, if you know what I mean, still live on the South Side. The University is there. I mean it's stuffy to some people, but anyhow it's different from the North Side. We have lots of connections there — Father controls fellowships at the University, and I thought if we took Nicole home, what could be better in her condition than if she fell in love with some good doctor—22"

The Warrens were going to buy Nicole a doctor! There was no use worrying about Nicole when they were able to buy her a nice young doctor.

"There must be many who'd jump at the chance," Baby said. "Now where is Nicole — she's gone off somewhere. I never know whether I ought to go ﬁnd her."

"I'll take a look around," Dick offered.

He found Nicole near the lake. "Your sister is worried."

"Oh! This has been an awfully exciting day."

"I know."

"I don't want to do anything antisocial — I've caused everybody enough trouble. But to-night I wanted to get away."

"You're a nice person — just keep using your own judgment about yourself."

"You like me?" "Of course."

"If I hadn't been sick would you— I mean, would I have been the sort girl you might have— you know what I mean."

He remembered the elder Miss Warren's words about young doctors that could be bought, and he hardened for a moment. "You're a nice kid, but I couldn't fall in love."

"You won't give me a chance.26"

"WHAT!"

The impertinence astonished him. "Give me a chance now."

She leaned toward him, and pressed her lips to his.

... For Doctor Diver to marry a mental patient? How did it happen? Where did it begin?

"BIG chance — oh, yes. My God! — they decided to buy a doctor? Well, they better ﬁnd him in Chicago." The following morning Dick went down to Montreux for a swim, got back to his hotel in time for dinner. A note awaited him.

DEAR DOCTOR DIVER: I phoned but you were out. I wonder if I may ask you a great big favor. I must go back to Paris. Can you let Nicole ride as far as Zurich with you

Sincerely,

BETH EVAN WARREN.

Dick was furious.

On the train Dick was sad to see Nicole's relief at going back to the only home she knew. When he left her outside the clinic door on the Zurichsee and she looked at him he knew her problem was one they had together for good.

CHAPTER III

In September I came out on the hotel terrace where Dick had tea with Baby.

"Nicole's rich, but that doesn't make me an adventurer," Dick said.

"That's just it," said Baby. "Nicole's rich. We don't think you're an adventurer. We don't know who you are."

"I'm a doctor of medicine," he said. "My father is a clergyman, now retired. We lived in Buffalo and my past is open to investigation. I went to New Haven. My great-grandfather was Governor of North Carolina."

I listened and thought that Dick might change his mind to marry me.

... We went to the lawyer and signed some papers. I had had no idea that I possessed so much money.

... It was so funny being together. We just loved and loved. It was wonderful to reach out and ﬁnd Dick warm beside me in the bed.

... Dick worked at the hospital. His book was selling everywhere — they wanted it published in six languages. I was to do the French translation but I was tired, so heavy with the baby.

... Dick would refuse to have a bigger apartment just because there was more Warren money than Diver money.

... We enjoyed our trip across Italy. Life was fun with Dick. We travelled a lot that year — we even went to Africa. But I had problems with my head by that time. That was why he took me travelling but after my second child, my little girl, Topsy, was born everything got dark again.

... When I got well I wanted to spend my money and have a house — I was tired of apartments and waiting for Dick. I wanted to have Dick at my side if I went to pieces again. I wanted to live near a warm beach where we could be brown and young together. We moved to Tarmes.

... Dick, why did you register at the hotel Mr. and Mrs. Diver instead of Doctor and Mrs. Diver? I just wondered — had Dick given up his work for good?

... Sometimes I sing, and I have a few friends too — Mary, for instance. Tommy Barban is in love with me, I think, a little. Enough, though, for him and Dick to dislike each other. I am among friends who like me. I am here on this quiet beach with my husband and two children.

... Yes, more new people — oh, that girl — yes. Who did you say she looked like ... No, I haven't, we don't see new American pictures here. Rosemary who? Yes, she's lovely ...

CHAPTER IV

At the Villa Diana, Dick went to his work-room, and opened the shutters. On his two long tables, in confusion, lay the materials of his book.

He saw Nicole in the garden. Presently he must meet her and the prospect gave him a nasty feeling. Before her he must keep up a perfect front, now and to-morrow, next week and next year. All night in Paris he had held her in his arms while she slept under the luminol. At noon Dick and Nicole left for the Riviera.

Then there was a reaction. He was annoyed with Nicole. Twice within a fortnight she had broken up: there had been the night of the dinner at Tarmes when he had found her in her bedroom laughing crazily and telling Mrs. McKisco she could not go in the bathroom because the key was thrown down the well. Mrs. McKisco was astonished and suspected the true reason for this laughter. Dick had not been worried. What happened in Paris was another matter. It meant possibly a new cycle, a new stage of the illness. Having gone through her long illness after Topsy's birth, he had hardened himself about her.

Dick didn't want to talk — he wanted to be alone with his thoughts about work and the future. He looked about the house that Nicole had made, that Nicole's grandfather had paid for. Out of three thousand a year and what he had from his publications he paid for his clothes and personal expenses, and for Lanier's education. Living rather ascetically, travelling third-class when he was alone, with the cheapest wine, he had some ﬁnancial independence. Naturally Nicole, wanting to own him, wanting him to be with her forever, encouraged him to spend her money.

His work became confused with Nicole's problems; in addition, her income had increased so fast recently that it seemed to belittle his work.

Just as Dick was painfully comparing his and Nicole's ﬁnancial positions, Franz suggested that they two should buy a good clinic on the Zugersee, as its owner intended to retire. Dick's ﬁrst impulse was to refuse, for it was possible to do only with Warren money. However, taking in consideration Nicole's unstable condition, he thought it was convenient to have a clinic at hand at any time.

Having used Warren money at the expense of his self-respect, Dick saw that two years on the Zugersee had been wasted time for Nicole. She had come out of her illness alive with new hopes, expecting so much, yet with no interest in life except Dick. Bringing up children, she could only pretend to love them. She led a lonely life owning Dick who did not want to be owned.

Dick was thirty-eight. For two years now he had lived at the clinic — certainly one of the best in Europe, visited by every psychologist passing through Zurich.

After Doctor Diver finished his morning inspection of the clinic, he returned to his villa. Nicole was wearing a strange expression.

"Read that," she said.

He opened the letter. It was from a woman who had recently left them without progress. It accused him of having seduced her daughter, who had been at her mother's side during her illness. It said that Mrs. Diver would be glad to have this information and learn what her husband was "really like".

Dick read the letter again. He recognized it as the letter of a maniac. Once he had let the girl ride into Zurich with him and in the evening had brought her back to the clinic. Later, she tried to carry the affair further, but he was not interested and probably because of that, the girl had come to dislike him, and taken her mother away. "This letter is crazy," he said. "I had no relations of any kind with that girl. I didn't even like her."

"Yes, I've tried thinking that," said Nicole.

"Surely you don't believe it? This is a letter from a mental patient."

"I was a mental patient."

He stood up and spoke more authoritatively.

"Don't have any nonsense, Nicole. Get the children ready and we'll start." In the car Nicole was silent; Dick was uneasy at her straight hard gaze. Often he felt lonely with her, and tired of her. But this afternoon the situation seemed serious.

They arrived at Zug where there was a fair. Dick parked the car, and Nicole looked at him with a sudden awful smile.

Dick tried to think what to do. The dualism in his views of her — that of the husband, that of the psychiatrist — was increasingly paralyzing. In these six years she had several times had crises.

As they were watching a Punchand-Judy show, Nicole began to run very suddenly. Far ahead he saw her yellow dress in the crowd, and he followed, he had even forgotten the children. Then he found her. She was laughing loudly in the crowd, a crowd which had gathered attracted by Nicole's hysteria. But when she saw Dick her laughter died. He caught her arm and held it as they walked away. "Why did you lose control of yourself like that?"

"You know very well why." "No, I don't."

"I saw that girl look at you — that little dark girl, a child, not more than ﬁfteen."

"Stop here a minute and quiet down. I left the children at the Punch-andJudy show. We ought to get them."

Fifteen minutes ago they had been a family.

"We're going home." "Home!" she shouted.

A wave of agony went over him. It was awful to watch her disintegration.

"Let's ﬁnd the children."

Dick found them, surrounded by women who were examining them with delight like ﬁne goods.9

They started back.

He had turned up a hill to the clinic, and as he stepped on the accelerator the car turned violently left, then right, tipped on two wheels as Nicole's mad hand clutched the steering wheel, and shot off the road; it ran into a tree.

The children were screaming and Nicole was screaming. Dick climbed over the top side and lifted out the children.

"You—!" he cried.

She was laughing crazily, unashamed, unafraid.

"You were scared, weren't you?" she laughed. "You wanted to live!"

Directly above them, half a kilometer away, was a hotel.

"Take Topsy's hand," he said to Lanier, "and climb up that hill — see the hotel? Tell them to come down."

Lanier, not sure what had happened, asked:

"What will you do, Dick?" "We'll stay here with the car."

Neither of them looked at their mother as they started off.

Dick was ﬁlled with a violent disgust.

In a few minutes some men came running down.

Three months later he told Franz: "I want to go away. For a month or so, for as long as I can."

"Why not, Dick? That was our original arrangement — it was you who insisted on staying. If you and Nicole—"

"I don't want to go away with Nicole. I want to go away alone. This last thing knocked me down. Look here: if I go to Berlin to the Psychiatric Congress could you manage the place? For three months she's been all right and she likes her nurse."

In Zurich the next week Dick drove to the airport and took a plane for Munich.

CHAPTER V

Tommy Barban was a hero — Dick happened to meet Tommy in the Marienplatz in Munich, in one of those cafés, where the air was full of politics. Tommy was at a table laughing.

Recently an eighth of the area of his skull had been removed by a Warsaw surgeon and there was knitting under his hair, and the weakest person in the café could have killed him with a slap of cards.

"—this is Prince Chillicheff—" A Russian of ﬁfty, "—and Mr. McKibben — and Mr. Hannan." He said immediately to Dick: "What are you doing here in Munich? Dick — how're you? How's Nicole? You don't look so lively as you used to."

The remark sounded too irritating and Dick was about to say something when the extraordinary suits worn by Tommy and Prince Chillicheff caught his eye.

"I see you are regarding our clothes," said the Prince. "We have just come out of Russia."

"These were made in Poland by the court tailor," said Tommy.

"You've been touring?" Dick asked. They laughed.

"Yes, we have been touring. That's it, touring."

Dick waited for an explanation. It came from Mr. McKibben in two words.

"They escaped."

"Have you been prisoners in Russia?"

"It was I," explained Prince Chillicheff, his dead yellow eyes staring at Dick. "Not a prisoner but in hiding." "Did you have much trouble getting out?"

"Some trouble. We left three Red Guards dead at the border. Tommy left two. I left one."

It was an escape story in the best tradition — an aristocrat hiding nine years with a former servant and working in a bakery; the eighteen-year-old daughter in Paris who knew Tommy Barban... Dick decided that this papier mâché relic of the past was scarcely worth the lives of three young men.

Hannan and Tommy were talking about something, Dick was not listening. Suddenly he heard they were talking about Abe North.

"The only difference is that Abe did it ﬁrst," said Tommy.

"I don't agree," persisted Hannan. "He got the reputation for being a good musician because he drank so much—" "What's this about Abe North?

What about him? Is he in trouble?" "Didn't you read The Herald this morning?"

"No."

"He's dead. He was beaten to death in a bar in New York. He just managed to crawl home."

"Abe North?"

"Yes, sure, they—"

"Abe North?" Dick stood up. "Are you sure he's dead?"

"The paper said so," McKibben insisted. "Beaten to death in a bar."

The faces were only formally sad but Dick's lungs burst for a moment with regret for Abe's death, and his own youth of ten years ago.

He reached Innsbruck, sent his bags up to a hotel and walked into town. Dick had come away for his soul's sake, and he began thinking about that. He had lost himself — he could not tell the hour when, or the day or the week, the month or the year.

His father's struggles in poor districts had given rise to a desire for money. He had been swallowed up like a gigolo, and somehow allowed the Warrens to possess him.

"I've wasted eight years teaching the rich how to live in a society.6"

After dinner and a bottle of local wine, he felt excited, without rested, excited without knowing why.

He was still excited, when he went up to his room to think. There he found a telegram from Buffalo, forwarded through Zurich.

"Your father died peacefully tonight. HOLMES."

He read the message again. He sat down on the bed, breathing and staring.

Dick felt sad that he had died alone — he had survived his wife, and his brothers and sisters; there were cousins in Virginia but they were poor and not able to come North, and Holmes, his father's curate, had had to sign the telegram. Dick loved his father — again and again he thought what his father would probably have thought or done. Dick was born several months after the death of two young sisters and his father had saved him from a spoiling by his mother by becoming his moral guide. He was one of those about whom it was said: "very much the gentleman, but not much get-up-and-go about him."

... Dick chose a ship to go to America, then he put in a call for Nicole in Zurich, wishing he had always been as good as he had intended to be.

A day after Dick arrived in Buffalo, at the churchyard, his father was laid among a hundred Divers. It was very friendly leaving him there with all his relations around him. Dick had no more ties here now and did not believe he would come back. "Good-by, my father — good-by, all my fathers." Albert McKisco, the most fashionable writer of the moment, was travelling to Europe by sea. His novels were based on the works of the best people of his time, and in addition he possessed a gift for softening what he borrowed, so that many readers were charmed by the ease with which they could follow him. Success had improved him. He was no fool about his capacities — he realized that many men had superior talent, and he enjoyed the success he had. "I've done nothing yet," he would say. "But if I keep trying I may write a good book." His success was founded psychologically upon his duel with Tommy Barban, upon the basis of which he had created a new self-respect.

Seeing Dick Diver the second day out, he introduced himself in a friendly way and sat down. Dick laid aside his reading and, after the few minutes that it took to realize the change in McKisco, the disappearance of the man's annoying sense of inferiority, found himself pleased to talk to him.

Violet was very grand now, charmed about the little discoveries that wellbred girls make in their teens. Now she "belonged" — together with several million other people — and she was happy.

The McKiscos got off at Gibraltar. Next evening Dick got off at Naples. A train took him to Rome, and Dick went to the Hotel Quirinal.

At the desk he suddenly stared, he saw her.

Rosemary saw him, too. She hurried over. As she came across the lobby, her beauty shocked him anew, "You WOULD turn up here — of all the people in the world."

Her hands closed over his on the desk; "Dick— we're making a picture; we may leave any day. We begin early because the mists rise at eleven — phone me at two."

In his room Dick shaved, lay for half an hour in a warm bath and had breakfast.

At ﬁrst he thought nothing. She was young and magnetic, but so was Topsy. He tried to collect all that might attract her — it was less than it had been four years ago. Dick had been at an emotional peak at the time of the previous meeting; now he had less enthusiasm.

At three he called Rosemary and was told to come up. He stopped in the bar for a gin-and-tonic.

"Hi, Doctor Diver!"

Only because of Rosemary's presence in the hotel did Dick place the man immediately as Collis Clay. He had his old conﬁdence.

"I was in Florence and I heard she was here so I came down last week.

Now she's a woman of the world — if you know what I mean."

"You studying in Florence?"

"Me? Sure, I'm studying architecture there. I go back Sunday."

As Dick came into her room, Rosemary was in black pajamas; a luncheon table was still in the room; she was having coffee.

"You're still beautiful," he said. "A little more beautiful than ever."

"Do you want coffee?" "No, thanks."

"Mother's coming over next month. She always asks me if I've seen you over here, as if she thought we were living next door. Mother always liked you — she always felt you were some one I ought to know."

"Well, I'm glad she still thinks of me."

"Oh, she does," Rosemary said. "A very great deal."

"I've seen you here and there in pictures," said Dick.

"I have a good part in this one if it isn't cut. How is Nicole — and Lanier and Topsy?"

"They're ﬁne. They often speak of you—"

"That's done," she said. "Do you realize I've spent the last hour getting ready for you?"

"Hard to sit here and be close to you, and not kiss you." Then they kissed passionately in the centre of the ﬂoor. She pressed against him, and went back to her chair.

"Tell me the truth about you," he demanded.

"I always have."

"Are you actually a virgin?"

"No-o-o!" she sang. "I've slept with six hundred and forty men — if that's the answer you want."

"Looking at you as a perfectly normal girl of twenty-two, living in the year nineteen twenty-eight, I guess you've had a few lovers."

"I can't go out with you to-night, darling, because I promised some people a long time ago. But if you get up early I'll take you out to the set tomorrow."

He dined alone at the hotel, went to bed early, and met Rosemary in the lobby at half-past six. They came to the huge set of the forum, larger than the forum itself. Rosemary was working on a stage while he was watching with interest.

The session ended, Dick and Rosemary had luncheon at a splendid restaurant overlooking the ruined forum. Afterward they drove back to the hotel, all ﬂushed and happy. She wanted to be taken and she was, and what had begun as a childish love affair on a beach was accomplished at last.

Rosemary had another dinner arrangement, a birthday party for a member of the company. Dick drank a cocktail in the lobby with Collis and his dissatisfaction crystallized as impatience — he was to go to the clinic. This was less a true feeling than a romantic memory. Nicole was his girl — too often he was sick at heart about her, yet she was his girl. Time with Rosemary was nothing — time with Collis was nothing plus nothing.

Rosemary asked Dick to lunch next day. They went to a little trattoria kept by an Italian who had worked in America. After Dick's discovery that he was not in love with her, nor she with him he knew he would not enter further into her life, and she became the strange woman for him.

"Let me be curious about you again?" he asked.

"What do you want to know?" "About men. I'm curious. Do you have anyone special?"

"It's difﬁcult." She was suddenly crying. "I do love you, never anybody like you. But what have you got for me? I never felt so mixed up in my life."

"I want to know the truth," he said. "Yes, then. My producer, Signor Nicotera. We're a lot together, he wants to marry me, but I don't want to. What of it? What do you expect me to do? You never asked me to marry you. Do you want me to play around forever with half-wits like Collis Clay?"

"You were with Nicotera last night?"

"That's none of your business," she sobbed.

"Is it like you felt toward me in Paris?"

"I feel comfortable and happy when I'm with you. In Paris it was different. But you never know how you once felt. Do you?

If he had to bring all the bitterness and hatred of the world into his heart, he was not going to be in love with her again.

"I don't care about Nicotera!" she declared. "But I've got to go to Livorno with the company to-morrow. Oh, why did this have to happen? Why did you come here? Why couldn't we just have the memory?"

"I've wondered for a long time." "But why bring it to me?"

"I guess I'm the Black Death," he said slowly. "I don't seem to bring people happiness any more."

BOOK 3

CHAPTER I

Frau Kaethe Gregorovius saw her husband coming to their villa.

"How was Nicole?" she asked. Franz looked at her in surprise. "Nicole's not sick. What makes you ask, dear?"

"You see her so much — I thought she must be sick."

"Excuse me, Franz," said Kaethe before he could speak. "Excuse me, dear, I had no right to say that. But there is a bad feeling between Nicole and me."

"Birds in their little nests agree," Franz shouted. "Birds — in — their — nests — AGREE!"

"I realize that. You haven't seen me be impolite with Nicole."

"Nicole is half a patient — she will possibly remain something of a patient all her life. In the absence of Dick I am responsible. There was a telegram from Rome this morning. Dick has had grippe and is starting home to-morrow."

Kaethe felt relief but still said:

"I think Nicole is less sick than any one thinks — her illness is an instrument of power. I don't like Americans. They're selﬁsh, SELF-ish!"

"You like Dick?"

"I like him," she admitted. "He's different, he thinks of others."

"Dick married Nicole for her money," she said. "That was his weakness — you said as much yourself one night."

"Why are you saying this?"

"I shouldn't have said that," she admitted. "We must all live together like birds, as you say. But it's difﬁcult when Nicole steps back a little when speaking to me, as if she were holding her breath — as if I SMELT bad!"

Kaethe had guessed the truth. She did most of her work herself, and she bought few clothes. And there was a hint of yesterday's sweat about Kaethe's person. To Franz this was as natural as the thick smell of Kaethe's hair, and he liked it; but to Nicole, born to hate the smell of a nurse's fingers dressing her, it was awful.

"And the children," Kaethe continued. "She doesn't like them to play with our children—" but Franz had heard enough:

"Hold your tongue — that kind of talk can hurt me professionally, since we owe this clinic to Nicole's money. Let us have lunch."

Kaethe realized that she should stop now, but Franz's words reminded her that other Americans had money, and a week later she put her dislike of Nicole into new words.

They had dinner with the Divers upon Dick's return. As soon as the Divers left, she said to Franz:

"The liquor I smelt on him tonight, and several other times since he's been back. Do you think that sort of thing does the clinic any good?" Kaethe demanded.

She paused: "Dick is no longer a serious man."

Franz went up the stairs, shaking her off. In their bedroom he turned on her.

"He is most certainly a serious man and a brilliant man. Of all the men who have recently taken their degrees in neuropathology in Zurich, Dick is more brilliant than I could ever be. I turn to Dick when cases are difﬁcult. His publications are standard in their line — go into any medical library and ask. I can't understand why you talk this way, Kaethe — I thought you liked him."

"It's a shame!" Kaethe said. "You do the work."

"Tch! Tch!"

"Very well, then. It's true."

The result of this conversation was that Franz never after believed that Dick was a serious person. And as time went on he convinced himself that he had never thought so.

Yet it was May before Franz found an opportunity to take his ﬁrst steps.

One morning, stopping at the desk for his mail, Dick saw something ex- traordinary happening outside: Patient Von Cohn Morris was going away. His parents, Australians, were putting his baggage into a large limousine. Doctor Diver approached.

"Isn't this a little sudden, Mr. Morris?"

Mr. Morris turned to Dick as though to strike him.

"High time we left, we and those who have come with us," he began. "It is high time, Doctor Diver. High time." "Will you come in my ofﬁce?" Dick suggested.

"Not I! I'll talk to you, but I'm washing my hands of you and your place."

He shook his ﬁnger at Dick. "We've wasted our time and our money. It's you, Doctor Diver, YOU, the very man. I won't wait. No, sir! I won't wait a minute after my son told me the truth." He came up to Dick. "My son is here for alcoholism, and he told us he smelt liquor on your breath. Yes, sir! Not once, but twice. Von Cohn says he has smelt liquor on your breath. I and my lady have never touched a drop of it in our lives. We've brought Von Cohn to you to be cured, and within a month he twice smells liquor on your breath!

What kind of cure is that there?" Dick hesitated: "After all, Mr. Morris, some people are not going to give up what they regard as food because of your son—"

"But you're a doctor, man!" cried Morris furiously. "When the workmen drink their beer that's bad to them — but you're here to cure—"

"This has gone too far. Your son came to us because of kleptomania."

"What was behind it? Drink — black drink. My son comes to a clinic, and a doctor smells of it!"

"I must ask you to leave."

"You ASK me! We ARE leaving!"

Dick went into his office. He watched until they drove away: it was easy to see the family go around Europe, making the clinic bad publicity. Dick asked himself the question if he had really provoked this. He drank claret with each meal, took hot rum at night, and sometimes he had gin in the afternoon — too much for his system. Doctors, chauffeurs, and Protestant clergymen could never smell of liquor, as could painters or brokers; Dick blamed himself, but the matter was not easier half an hour later when

Franz entered the ofﬁce.

Dick said: "The Morris boy was taken away — there was a row."

"What about? He was a devil, that boy."

Dick said:

"One of the things the boy said to his father was that I am a drunkard. You can imagine how hard it was to defend yourself in a situation like that!" "Dick, I know well that you are a well-balanced man, even though we do not agree about alcohol. But time has come — Dick, I must say that I have known several times that you have had a drink when it was not the moment to have one. Sometimes you don't use your common sense."

He was absolutely disgusted by the situation. To explain? NO.

"This won't go," he said suddenly. "Well, that's occurred to me," Franz admitted. "Your heart isn't in this project any more, Dick."

"I know. I want to leave — we could make some arrangement about taking Nicole's money."

"I have thought about that too, Dick — I have seen this coming. It will be possible to take all your money out by the end of the year."

Dick had not intended to come to a decision so quickly, nor was he prepared for Franz's agreement to the break, yet he felt relief.

CHAPTER II

The Divers returned to the Riviera, which was home. Dick wrote a little with no particular method; it was one of those parts of life that is an awaiting; not upon Nicole's health, which seemed to be very good, nor upon work, but simply an awaiting. What gave a purpose to the period was the children. Dick's interest in them increased with their ages, now eleven and nine. He came to know them much better than Nicole did, and he talked and played with them for a long time. They had that charm of children, who have learned early not to cry or laugh freely and loudly; they were taught not to show any strong emotion, but were happy with the simple pleasures allowed them. They lived as was thought advisable in old families of the Western world.

In the recent years, Lanier had developed an extraordinary conﬁdence in and admiration for his father. He was a handsome, promising boy and Dick devoted much time to him. Lanier was an unpredictable boy with an inhuman curiosity. An avalanche of his questions often puzzled Dick. Topsy was easier. She was nine and very fair and graceful like Nicole, and in the past Dick had worried about that. Lately she had become as healthylooking as any American child. He was satisﬁed with them both, but did not show it to them. "Either one learns politeness at home," Dick said, "or the world teaches it to you and you may get hurt in the process. What do I care whether Topsy ‘loves' me or not? I'm not bringing her up to be my wife." Another important element of this summer and autumn for the Divers was plenty of money. After the sale of their share in the clinic, and some developments in America, there was now so much that the spending of it needed time and effort.

Nicole went to the window and took a look at the terrace; the April sun shone on the face of Augustine, the cook, and the butcher's knife she waved in her drunken hand. She had been with them since their return to Villa Diana in February.

She could see only Dick's head and his hand holding one of his heavy sticks. The knife and the stick reminded her of gladiatorial fights. Dick's words reached her ﬁrst:

"I don't care how much kitchen wine you drink but when I find you drinking from a bottle of Chablis Moutonne3—"

"You talk about drinking!" Augustine cried. "You drink — all the time!"

Nicole called over to him: "What's the matter, Dick?" and he answered:

"The old girl has been drinking the vintage wines. I'm firing her — at least I'm trying to."

"Heavens! Well, don't let her reach you with that knife."

Augustine shook her knife up at Nicole.

"I would like to say, Madame, if you knew that your husband drinks like a day-laborer—"

"Shut up and get out!" interrupted Nicole.

"You — a disgusting American!" Dick called up to Nicole:

"Get the children away from the house till I ﬁnish this."

"—disgusting Americans who come here and drink up our ﬁnest wines," screamed Augustine.

"You must leave now! I'll pay you what we owe you," Dick said.

"Very sure you'll pay me! And let me tell you—" she came close and waved the knife so furiously that Dick raised his stick.

The situation was serious — Augustine was a strong woman and could be disarmed only at the risk of serious results to herself — and legal complications for those who attacked a French citizen.

Finally, Augustine gave in: she would leave only when her nephew could come for her baggage. There was no further trouble — when the nephew arrived, all apologetic, Augustine said good-by to Dick and Nicole.

In the afternoon, the Divers went to Nice and dined at a restaurant. There was little they dared talk about in these days; seldom did they ﬁnd the right word in time, it arrived always a moment too late when one could not reach the other any more.

"We can't go on like this," Nicole said. "Or can we?— what do you think?" Dick sat silent, and she continued, "Some of the time I think it's my fault — I've ruined you."

"So I'm ruined, am I?" he asked in a pleasant voice.

"I didn't mean that. But you used to want to create things — now you seem to want to break them."

She trembled at criticizing him — but his long silence frightened her even more. She guessed that something was developing behind the silence, behind the hard, blue eyes, the almost unnatural interest in the children. His bursts of temper surprised her — he suddenly spilled harsh contempt for some person, race, class, way of life, way of thinking. It was as though something was going on inside him, about which she could only guess in the moments when it broke through.

"After all, what do you get out of this?" she demanded.

"Aren't you're stronger every day? That's what I've done!"

"Dick!" and she stretched her hand forward to his across the table. Dick pulled his hand back and he added: "We have to think of the whole situation, not just you." He put his hand on hers and said:

"See that boat out there?"

It was the motor yacht of T. F. Golding. "We'll go out there now and ask the people on board what's the matter with them. We'll find out if they're happy."

"We hardly know him," Nicole objected.

"He invited us. Besides, Baby knows him — she practically married him, didn't she?"

When they were approaching the yacht in a hired boat, Nicole had doubts.

"He's having a party—"

They were greeted by a huge whitehaired man in a white suit looking down at them and calling:

"Do I recognize the Divers?"

Golding gave Nicole a hand and they got on board.

"Just in time for dinner."

A small orchestra was playing. Nicole was sorry they had come, and annoyed by Dick. As they passed through the principal salon they saw a lot of people dancing. The guests sat on a wide divan, of whom one brought from Nicole a cry of delight.

"Tommy!"

Nicole pressed her face against his. They sat, or rather lay down together on the divan. His handsome face had got very dark under unknown suns.

"You look just like all the adventurers in the movies—but why did you stay away so long?"

Tommy Barban looked at her, his eyes ﬂashed.

"Five years," she continued. "MUCH too long. Couldn't you only kill a certain number of men and then come back?"

"After all, I am a hero," Tommy said calmly, only half joking. "I have courage like a lion."

Golding approached, and said that they were starting for Cannes immediately after dinner; that Dick was now on the phone, telling their chauffeur in Nice to drive their car to Cannes.

They moved into the dining salon and Nicole heard Dick talk in a dogmatic voice:

"... It's all right for you English, you're doing a dance of death... You have no future."

A woman answered sharply: "After all a cheap fellow is a cheap fellow."

Again he had offended some one — couldn't he hold his tongue?

Dick remained in his seat wearing a strange expression; then he said harshly:

"I don't like your nasty English whispers."

The same woman spoke in a voice heard by the whole company.

"You asked for it— speaking so of my countrymen.11 You were seen with a questionable crowd in Lausanne.

You're questionable yourself. Is that a nasty whisper?"

Golding crushed out the phrase with his voice saying:

"What! What!" and moved his guests on out. Nicole saw that Dick was still sitting at the table. She was furious at the woman for her words, and equally furious at Dick for having brought them here.

A moment later she saw Dick in complete control of himself as he talked with Golding.

"I was worried," she said to him. "Oh, you were worried?"

"Oh, don't talk that way. It would give me so much pleasure if I could do a little something for you, Dick."

"I believe that's true, Nicole. And I believe that the littler it was, the more pleasure it would give you."

His face was pale.

"You ruined me, did you?" he asked harshly. "Then we're both ruined. So—" She was cold with terror. Tears streamed down Nicole's face — in a moment she heard some one approaching; it was Tommy.

"Are you rich, Tommy?" Dick asked him.

"Not as things go now. I got tired of the brokerage business and went away. But I have good stocks. All goes well."

A few couples were dancing. Nicole and Tommy joined them and Tommy remarked: "Dick seems to be drinking."

"Only a little," she said loyally.

"There are those who can drink and those who can't. Dick can't. You ought to tell him not to."

When they reached Cannes, Dick said good-by to the company, and for a moment he seemed about to say something nasty, but Tommy's arm pulled him to the waiting car.

"I'll see you home," Tommy suggested.

"Don't bother."

"I'd like to, if you can put me up." On the back seat of the car Dick remained quiet, then he went into sleep.

CHAPTER III

Next morning Dick came early into Nicole's room. "I feel badly about the evening. Tommy drove us home? Or did I dream it?"

"You know he did."

"I think I'll call on him."

She was glad when he left her, for almost the ﬁrst time in her life.

Tommy was in his bed.

"Feel all right?" Dick asked.

When Tommy complained of a sore throat he remembered he was a professional.

"Better have something for it." "You have one?"

"I haven't — probably Nicole has." "Don't disturb her."

"She's up."

"How is she?"

Nicole, going downstairs, heard the conversation. She knew, as she had always known, that Tommy loved her; she knew he had come to dislike Dick, and that Dick had realized it. This thought was followed by a moment of satisfaction. She came up to her children's breakfast table and gave instructions to the governess, while upstairs two men were thinking about her.

Later in the garden she was happy; she did not want anything to happen, but only for the situation to remain as it was; she had not existed for a long time.

Nicole went on through her garden routine. Reaching the sea wall she stopped and thought. She was shocked at the idea of being interested in another man—but other women have lovers — why not me? Why shouldn't I?

She sat upon the low wall and looked down upon the sea. If she need not be forever with Dick, she must be something, not an addition to him. Going back to the house she became doubtful again.

Dick and Tommy were on the terrace. She walked through them, and kept her eyes away from Dick.

"Nicole—" Tommy began but started coughing.

"I'm going to get you some special camphor rub," she suggested. "It's American — Dick believes in it. I'll be just a minute."

"I must go really."

When she returned with the jar, the chauffeur was at the door.

"When you get to the hotel rub this into your throat and chest," she said. As Tommy went down the steps, Dick whispered: "Don't give Tommy the whole jar — it has to be ordered from Paris — we can't get it here."

Tommy came back. Nicole walked up to the car.

"Take it," she said. "It's very rare." She heard Dick grow silent at her side; she waved as the car drove off with Tommy and the special camphor rub.

"That gesture was not necessary," Dick said. "There are four of us here — and for years whenever there's a cough—"

They looked at each other.

In a week Nicole forgot about Tommy — she had not much memory for people and forgot them easily. But in June he wrote a little note to them both — and she opened it together with other mail. After reading it she threw it over to Dick, and he threw a telegram to her:

Dears will be at Gausses tomorrow unfortunately without mother want see you.

"I'll be glad to see her," said Nicole, grimly.

But she went to the beach with Dick next morning, afraid that he was making some desperate decision. Since the evening on Golding's yacht she had felt what was going on. For months every word had seemed to have some other meaning. The most unhappy aspect of their relations was Dick's growing indifference, which led to too much drink. She couldn't guess how he was going to behave next, nor what would happen at the end.

Nicole had been designed for ﬂight, with money as wings. Nicole could feel the fresh breeze already.

As the Divers went out on the beach, Nicole hardened as Dick looked about for Rosemary.

"There she is," Nicole remarked, pointing at a raft.

"Let's swim out and speak to Rosemary," he suggested.

"You go."

"We'll both go." She struggled a moment against him, but then they swam out together.

Rosemary was beautiful — her youth was a shock to Nicole — she was more conﬁdent than she had been ﬁve years ago.

"Five years ago you came here," said Dick. "And what a funny little thing you were, in one of those hotel peignoirs!"

"How you remember things! You always did — and always the nice things."

Nicole saw the old game beginning again and she dove under water, coming up again to hear:

"I'm going to pretend it's ﬁve years ago and I'm a girl of eighteen again. You could always make me feel happy, you and Nicole. You're the nicest people I've ever known, maybe ever will." Swimming away, Nicole saw that the cloud of Dick's heart-sickness had lifted a little as he began to play with Rosemary.

"Do you practise on the Riviera?" Rosemary asked later, seated under an umbrella.

"It'd be easy to find likely patients." He nodded here and there at the people around them. "Great candidates. Notice our old friend, Mrs. Abrams?"

Nicole could stand it no more. She stood up sharply, turned to Topsy.

"Would you like to be an actress when you grow up? I think you'd make a ﬁne actress," Rosemary said to the girl.

Nicole stared at her and in her grandfather's voice said, slow and distinct:

"It's absolutely OUT to put such ideas in the heads of other people's children. Remember, we may have quite different plans for them." She turned sharply to Dick. "I'm going to take the car home."

"You haven't driven for months," he protested.

"I haven't forgotten how."

Driving home, Nicole relaxed and felt new and happy; her thoughts were clear — she felt being cured. "I'm practically alone, without him," she thought. And as soon as she got home, she wrote Tommy Barban in Nice a short provocative letter.

But that was in the daytime — toward evening she was again afraid of what was in Dick's mind; again she felt that he had a plan, she was afraid of his plans — they worked well and they had a logic which Nicole was not able to control.

Next morning, back from shopping in Cannes, Nicole found a note saying that Dick had taken the small car and gone up into Provence for a few days by himself. As she read it the phone rang — it was Tommy Barban, saying that he had received her letter and was driving over.

Nicole took a bath, put on a smart dress, and crossed herself with Chanel Sixteen. When Tommy drove up at one o'clock she was ready.

How good to look like this, to be loved again, to pretend to have a mystery! She had lost two years in the life of a pretty girl — now she felt like making up for them. Attractive women of nineteen and of twenty-nine are alike in their conﬁdence.

Nicole did not want any spiritual romance — she wanted an "affair"; she wanted a change. She realized that it was a vulgar business, an affair without emotion. On the other hand, she blamed Dick for the current situation, and honestly thought that such an experiment might have a therapeutic value. All summer she had been stimulated by watching people do exactly what they wanted to do without any punishment.

Tommy caught her up in his arms and pulled her around to him, looking at her eyes.

"Don't move," he said. "I'm going to look at you a great deal from now on."

"Do you like what you see?" she asked.

He pulled her closer.

"I like whatever I see about you." He hesitated. "I thought I knew your face but it seems there are some things I didn't know about it. When did you begin to have a crook's eyes?"

She broke away, shocked and indignant, and cried:

"I have no mirror here," she said, "but if my eyes have changed it's because I'm well again. And perhaps I've gone back to my true self — I suppose my grandfather was a crook and I'm a crook after him."

"Where's Dick — is he lunching with us?"

"Dick's on a tour," she said. "Rosemary Hoyt turned up, and either they're together or she upset him so much that he wants to go away and dream about her."

"You are the most dramatic person I have known."

"I suppose I've got—"

"You've got too much money," he said impatiently. "That's the trouble with you. Dick can't stand it."

"What do you think I ought to do?"

For the ﬁrst time in ten years she was under the inﬂuence of a personality other than her husband's. Everything Tommy said to her became part of her forever.

They drank a bottle of wine, Tommy came over behind her and laid his arms on hers, their cheeks touched and then their lips.

"Can't you send the governess and the children away for the afternoon?" "They have a piano lesson. Anyhow

I don't want to stay here." "Kiss me again."

A little later, riding toward Nice, she thought: So I have a crook's eyes, have I? Very well then, better a sane crook than a mad puritan.

She turned to Tommy.

"Have we GOT to go all the way to your hotel?21"

He brought the car to a stop. "No!" he answered. "And, my God,

I have never been so happy as I am this minute."

They had passed through Nice, and stopped near a small shore hotel.

Tommy ﬁlled out the police blanks — his real, hers false. Their room was a Mediterranean room, almost ascetic, almost clean. Simplest of places. Tommy ordered two cognacs, and when the door closed behind the waiter, he sat in the only chair, dark and handsome, like a Satan.

Before they had ﬁnished the brandy they suddenly moved together and met standing up; she forgot about Dick and her new crook's eyes, forgot Tommy himself and sank deeper and deeper into the minutes and the moment.

... When he got up, he inspected her white torso and the brown limbs and head, and said laughing:

"You are all new like a baby." "With a crook's eyes."

"I'll take care of that."

"It's very hard taking care of a crook's eyes — especially the ones made in Chicago."

"I know lots of tricks."

They dined at the new Beach Casino at Monte Carlo and then much later they swam in the sea. She liked his bringing her there; it was all as new as they were to each other.

They awoke together finding the moon gone down and the air cool. She demanded the time and Tommy called it was about three.

"I've got to go home then."

"I thought we'd sleep in Monte Carlo."

"No. There's a governess and the children. I've got to get home before daylight."

"As you like."

At the gate of Villa Diana she kissed him an almost automatic good-by.

CHAPTER IV

At four o'clock next afternoon a station taxi stopped at the gate and Dick got out. Suddenly off balance, Nicole ran from the terrace to meet him.

"Where's the car?" she asked.

"I left it in Arles. I didn't feel like driving any more."

"I thought from your note that you'd be several days."

"I ran into a mistral and some rain." "Did you have fun?"

"Just as much fun as anybody has running away from things. I drove Rosemary as far as Avignon and put her on her train there." They walked toward the terrace together. "I didn't tell you in the note because I thought you'd imagine a lot of things. I wanted to ﬁnd out if she had anything to offer — the only way was to see her alone."

"Did she have — anything to offer?" "Rosemary didn't grow up," he answered. "It's probably better that way. What have you been doing?"

She felt her face change.

"I went dancing last night — with Tommy Barban. We went—"

He interrupted her: "Don't tell me about it. It doesn't matter what you do, only I don't want to know anything."

"There isn't anything to know." "All right, all right." Then as if he had been away a week: "How are the children?"

The phone rang in the house.

"If it's for me I'm not home," said Dick turning away quickly. "I've got some things to do."

Nicole waited till he was out of sight; then she went into the house and took up the phone.

"Nicole, how are you?" "Dick's home."

"Meet me here in Cannes," he suggested. "I've got to talk to you."

"I can't."

"Tell me you love me." Without speaking she nodded at the receiver; he repeated, "Tell me you love me."

"Oh, I do," she said. "But there's nothing to be done right now."

"Of course there is," he said impatiently. "Dick sees it's over between you two— What does he expect you to do?"

"I don't know. I'll have to—" She stopped herself from saying "—to wait until I can ask Dick," and instead ﬁnished with: "I'll write and I'll phone you to-morrow."

She walked about the house, feeling satisfaction. Yesterday came back to her now in detail. With the opportunistic memory of women she scarcely remembered how she had felt when she and Dick had possessed each other in secret places around the corners of the world, during the month before they were married. Just so had she lied to Tommy last night, swearing to him that never before had she so completely, so ...

... then remorse turned her walk toward Dick's room.

Approaching noiselessly she saw him on the terrace, sitting in a chair, and for a moment she regarded him silently. He was thinking, he was living a world completely his own and in his face, she saw him progress from phase to phase of his own story going on inside him, his own, not hers. For almost the first time in her life she was sorry for him — it is hard for those who have once been mentally sick to be sorry for those who are well, she had thought of him really as a source of energy, always active — she forgot the troubles she caused him. Did he know that he no longer controlled her? Had he wished it all? — she felt as sorry for him as she had sometimes felt for Abe North, sorry as for the helplessness of infants and the old.

She went up putting her arm around his shoulder and touching their heads together said:

"Don't be sad."

He looked at her coldly. "Don't touch me!" he said.

Confused she moved a few feet away. "Excuse me," he continued abstractedly. "I was just thinking what I thought of you—"

"Why not add the new classiﬁcation to your book?"

"I have thought of it — ‘Beyond the psychoses and the neuroses—' "

"I didn't come over here to quarrel."

"Then why DID you come, Nicole? I can't do anything for you any more. I'm trying to save myself."

"From what?"

"Profession throws me in contact with questionable company sometimes."

She felt anger rise in her.12

"You're a coward! You've made a failure of your life, and you want to blame it on me."

While he did not answer she began to feel his old hypnotism. Again she struggled with it, with her affair with another man; she fought him with her money and her knowledge that her sister disliked him and was behind her now; with the thought of the new enemies he was making with his bitterness, with her health and beauty against his physical deterioration. And suddenly, in the space of two minutes she achieved her victory and justiﬁed herself to herself without lie, cut the cord forever.

Dick waited until she was out of sight. The case was ﬁnished. Doctor Diver was free.

Dick and Nicole usually went together to have their hair cut. They were at the Carleton Hotel, when a car passed them and Tommy Barban was in it. His appearance disturbed her. The mirror in front of Nicole reﬂected the passage between the men's side and the women's, and Nicole saw Tommy entering and walking into the men's room.

In a minute Dick came up to Nicole, annoyed.

"Your friend has worked himself up into a state. He wants to see us together, so I agreed to talk to him. Come along!"

"But my hair — it's half cut."

"It doesn't matter — come along!" She followed Dick from the hotel.

Outside Tommy was waiting.

"We'll go to the Café des Alliées," said Dick.

Tommy agreed.

"Your wife does not love you," said Tommy suddenly. "She loves me."

The two men regarded each other in silence.

"It's clear to me that your marriage to Nicole has run its course. I've waited ﬁve years for that to be so," Tommy said.

"What does Nicole say?" They both looked at her.

"I've gotten very fond of Tommy, Dick."

He nodded.

"You don't care for me any more," she continued. "It's all just habit. Things were never the same after Rosemary."

Tommy broke in sharply with: "You don't understand Nicole. You treat her always like a patient because she was once sick. She would have more happiness with me."

"You'd be new to each other. But Nicole and I have had much happiness together, Tommy."

Tommy faced Dick, saying: "I think Nicole wants a divorce, I suppose you'll make no obstacles?"

Nicole wanted Dick to take the initiative, but he sat quiet with his hair half-cut.

"Isn't it true you're not happy with me any more?" Nicole continued. "With- out me you could get to your work again — you could work better if you didn't worry about me."

Tommy moved impatiently.

"That is useless. Nicole and I love each other."

"Well, then," said the Doctor, "I think we should go back to complete the haircuts. Nicole and I will talk things over. Don't worry — I agree in principal, and Nicole and I understand each other."

"Remember that from this moment," Tommy said, "I stand in the position of Nicole's protector until details can be arranged."

Dick nodded, and walked off toward the hotel with Nicole's eyes following him.

"He was fair enough," Tommy admitted. "Darling, will we be together to-night?"

"I suppose so."

So it had happened — and with a minimum of drama; Nicole realized that from the episode of the camphorrub Dick had expected it. She felt happy and excited, but her eyes followed his ﬁgure until it was lost in the summer crowd.

The day before Doctor Diver left the Riviera he spent all his time with his children. He was not young any more, so he wanted to remember them well. The children had been told that this winter they would be with their aunt in London and that soon they were going to come and see him in America.

He was glad he had given so much to the little girl — about the boy he was more uncertain — always he had been uneasy about what he had to give to the children. But, when he said good-by to them, he wanted to hold them close for hours.

Nicole was sleeping late, as had been agreed upon — he left a note for her, and one for Baby Warren who was just back from Sardinia and staying at the house. Dick took a big drink from a bottle of brandy, then he decided to leave his bags by the station in Cannes and take a last look at Gausse's Beach. The beach was nearly empty, when Nicole and her sister arrived that morning. When Nicole started out on the beach she saw Dick, not dressed for swimming, sitting on a rock above. In a minute Baby joined her, saying: "Dick's still there."

"This is his place — in a way, he discovered it. Old Gausse always says it was Dick who made this place fashionable."

Baby looked calmly at her sister. "Dick was a good husband to me for six years," Nicole said. "All that time I never suffered a minute's pain because of him, and he always did his best never to let anything hurt me."

There was contempt in Baby's face as she said:

"That's what he was educated for." The sisters sat in silence; Nicole thinking about her future; Baby considering whether or not to marry the latest candidate for her hand and money.

"Is he gone?" Nicole asked after a while.

Baby looked.

"No. Anyhow there are so many people now that he won't see us."

He had seen them though. As he stood up he swayed a little; he did not feel well any more. Faces turned to him from several umbrellas.

"I'm going to him." Nicole got to her feet.

"No, you're not," said Baby, pulling her down.

CHAPTER V

Nicole kept in touch with Dick after her new marriage; there were letters on business matters, and about the children. When she said, as she often did, "I loved Dick and I'll never forget him," Tommy answered, "Of course not — why should you?"

Dick opened an ofﬁce in Buffalo, but evidently without success. Nicole did not ﬁnd what the trouble was, but she heard a few months later that he was in a little town named Batavia, N.Y., practising general medicine, and later that he was in Lockport, doing the same thing. By accident she heard more about his life there than anywhere: that he bicycled a lot, was much admired by the ladies, and always had a lot of papers on his desk that were known to be an important work on some medical subject, almost completed. He was considered to have ﬁne manners and once made a good speech at a public health meeting on the subject of drugs; but he had an affair with a girl who worked in a grocery store, and he also had some professional problems; so he left Lockport.

After that he didn't ask for the children to be sent to America and didn't answer when Nicole wrote asking him if he needed money. In the last letter she had from him he told her that he was practising in Geneva, New York, and she got the impression that he lived with someone who kept house for him. Geneva was considered a pleasant place. So she liked to think.
