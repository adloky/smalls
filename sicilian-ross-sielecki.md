**1.e4**

Hello and Welcome to the Quickstarter Guide for Keep it Simple: 1.e4 ! The Quickstarter Guide provides an overview of the most important lines and ideas of the suggested full repertoire. It features the most commonly played lines and therefore studying this guide gives you the opportunity to be ready to employ this repertoire before studying all the dedicated chapters move-by-move. It is the ideal way to start your journey into the world of 1.e4, but it will also be useful at a later stage to give you a condensed overview of the material. Let's get started with some chess moves !

**1...c5**

The Sicilian Defence is popular on all levels and Black's most respected reply to 1.e4, on par with the classical 1...e5. The nonsymmetrical nature of the position is often leading to a tense, complicated game.The most principled way to fight the Sicilian is to play the Open Sicilian, basically going 2.Nf3 and 3.d4, almost regardless of Black's second move. The main practical issue with this approach is: Black has a very wide range of subvariations that you need to prepare for and most of them require very precise move-by-move knowledge.One key idea of the 'Keep It Simple' approach is that it should be possible for you to find good moves over the board in case you have forgotten your concrete lines. In the Open Sicilian however there are many lines that almost impossible to figure out over the board. It can easily happen that one inaccurate move leads to severe trouble.This is the reason why the Open Sicilian is not featured in this book. Instead I decided to suggest an anti-Sicilian repertoire, based on Bb5 (+) and a delayed c3 (Alapin) , depending on Black's 2nd move choice.One practical advantage of this repertoire is that it starts with 2.Nf3. That means that once you have mastered the lines presented here you can easily, at a later stage, expand your repertoire with an Open Sicilian against a particular Black 2nd move, while still not needing to learn all possible Black systems. For example you may decide at some point to play 3.d4 against 2...e6. That is an open Sicilian, but Black cannot play lines like the Najdorf, Dragon or Sveshnikov anymore. Most likely you would get a Taimanov, Kan, or Scheveningen. That's far more managable than playing the Open Sicilian all the time. This way the suggested repertoire is easily modifyable you may use all of it or replace a particular line with something else later if you so desire.<addz start="3.d4"/><addz start="3.d4"/><skip start="2...e6"/>

**2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

This is the Rossolimo variation, our choice against 2...Nc6. Nowadays this is not a sideline anymore, but possibly White's main try for an advantage, which avoids entering the open Sicilian with 3.d4. At the professional level, the main reason for avoiding the open Sicilian after 2...Nc6 is the Sveshnikov variation after 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5. White struggles to find anything against it, so many Pros have switched to 3.Bb5. For our purposes the Rossolimo is a very logical choice as it is based on very sound principles, including quick development and good pawn structures. The positions are usually more strategic in nature, and it is possible to find them over the board in case you have forgotten what you looked at before the game. Black has a plethora of options against the Rossolimo. But don't feel too intimidated as none of them require extremely detailed knowledge to avoid trouble. You will be OK with common sense moves and frequently get good positions using the ideas presented in this repertoire.In the starting position of the Rossolimo Black has tried many different rare moves. We'll have a look at all these minor options in chapter 3.

**3...a6**

To be honest, I always thought that this move makes little sense, but closer study revealed that it is not as bad as I thought. Against the main lines 3...e6/3...g6/3...d6 White often takes on c6 completely unprovoked on move 4, so why encourage the trade ? In addition, having the pawn on a6 is a disadvantage compared to the pawn being on a7, as b6 is weakened. As mentioned previously, things are not as simple as you might think - White is better, but needs to be precise.

**4.Bxc6 bxc6 5.O-O d5**

This weakens c5 enormously. It looks a lot like a reversed Nimzo Saemisch but with White being two tempi up. Black has also tried 5...d6 , after which 6.e5 ! is very strong. Black needs to answer 6...d5 , as otherwise the position, and especially the e-file, will open even more quickly. After giving up the Bishop pair White will usually need compensation in the form of a structural weakness (exploitable doubled pawns) or a lead in development. Here the Queenside pawns are very weak and will often fall to ideas like Nc3-a4, b3 and Ba3.

**6.d3 Bg4 7.h3 Bh5 8.c4**

Of course not the only way to a nice edge, but fixing the doubled pawns makes a lot of sense.

**8...dxe4**

Trying to solve the problems with trades does not ultimately help.

**9.dxe4 Qxd1 10.Rxd1 Bxf3 11.gxf3 e6 12.Nc3 Nf6 13.Na4 Be7 14.Be3**

A typical setup to put pressure on c5.

**14...Nd7 15.f4**

White is much better here with simple means. Doubling on the d-file and a potential Rd3-b3 comes to mind.

### (24) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #24 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Qc7**

This move is mostly played to allow a recapture on c6 with the Queen. There is one substantial drawback, however - Black further delays Kingside development and castling.

**4.O-O a6**

The most popular and principled move. On other moves we simply go Re1/c3/d4, opening up the position while ahead in development.

**5.Bxc6 Qxc6 6.Nc3**

White's advantage in development has reached scary proportions, but the position is not yet open. We need to play a quick d2-d4 now and accelerate the play.

**6...e6 7.d4 cxd4 8.Nxd4**

8.Qxd4 is of equal value.

**8...Qc7 9.Re1**

This is best here. It prevents the natural move Nf6 due to e4-e5. White has excellent attacking chances here. Note that White has ideas like Qg4, preparing Bf4. An additional option is Bg5-h4-g3 to put more pressure on d6. Black's position is tough to defend.

### (25) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #25 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Nf6**

This is a sideline, but somewhat underestimated in my opinion. It is not easy to prove anything against it. Usually 4.Nc3 is viewed as critical, but this might get very complicated, which I feel is not warranted for a rather rare line.

**4.e5**

This will lead to positions that are very similar to the line starting with 3...g6 4.O-O Bg7 5.Re1 Nf6 6.e5. This was my main reason to go with 4.e5 here. It is easier to play and it heads to middlegames that are part of our repertoire anyway.

**4...Nd5 5.O-O Nc7 6.Bxc6 bxc6**

This is risky as it delays development even further.

**7.Re1**

This aims for a transposition again. Black has no good way to avoid it.

**7...g6**

What else to develop ?!

**8.Nc3 Bg7**

A rare move that neglects development.

**9.Na4**

This is usually reached via 3...g6 4.O-O Bg7 5.Re1 Nf6 6.e5 Nd5 7.Nc3 Nc7 8.Bxc6 bxc6 ?! 9.Na4 ! White is better, please see the main line for further info on it. This is a novelty suggested by Stockfish. Usually White plays 9.Ne4 , here, and is comfortable, but 9.Na4 seems even better.

**9...Ne6 10.b3 O-O 11.Bb2 d6**

If Black does not commit with this move White has many improving moves at his disposal. A setup with pawns on d3 and c4 comes to mind, as well as Qd2-e3, Bb2-a3 to play against c5 and provoke d7-d6, after all.

**12.exd6**

This is one major point of Na4. Now the simplifications lead to a slight, but very one-sided, advantage for White.

**12...exd6 13.Bxg7 Nxg7 14.d4 cxd4 15.Qxd4**

This structure bears some resemblance with the Scotch four Knights. Black suffers from central weaknesses.

### (26) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #26 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Nf6**

This is a sideline, but somewhat underestimated in my opinion. It is not easy to prove anything against it. Usually 4.Nc3 is viewed as critical, but this might get very complicated, which I feel is not warranted for a rather rare line.

**4.e5**

**4...Nd5 5.O-O Nc7 6.Bxc6 dxc6 7.h3**

Avoiding any Bg4 ideas.

**7...g6 8.Re1 Bg7 9.d3 Ne6 10.Nbd2**

10.Nc3 is also possible, but this would be a slightly better version of the 3...g6 main line as White has played h3, which he does not need to do in the 3...g6 line. I like the idea to play Nbd2 here.

**10...O-O 11.a4**

Allowing a4-a5 is a bit awkward for Black, so he will most likely stop that.

**11...a5 12.Nf1 Qc7 13.Bd2**

White's idea is to play Qc1 and Bh6. The f1-Knight might be activated with Nh2-g4. I like White here, but Black is quite solid of course.

### (27) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #27 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...e6**

The second most popular move for Black, only surpassed by 3...g6. Black's main idea is to go Nge7 to allow a recapture on c6 with a Knight. The other point is to support a later ...d5.

**4.O-O**

Here White's main alternative is 4.Bxc6 , creating an imbalance in the position immediately. White gives up the pair of Bishops, but creates weaknesses in Black's camp. I prefer 4.O-O for our repertoire, because it is easier to learn and understand. If you'd like to expand your repertoire at a later stage I advise you to have a closer look at 4.Bxc6.

**4...Nge7**

This is the most consistent with 3...e6. Black prepares ...a6 and/ or ...d5.

**5.Re1**

White has to commit regarding his Bishop on b5. He may play 5.c3 , signalling his intention to drop it to b3/c2 later. This has some similarities to the Ruy Lopez. My choice is 5.Re1 in order to drop the Bishop back to f1 and then expand in the centre. Both moves are good and of roughly equal value theoretically.

**5...a6 6.Bf1**

Preserving the Bishop. 6.Bxc6 is actually quite OK as well. After 6...Nxc6 7.d4 we would, however, get a position more in the spirit of the open Sicilian which I want to avoid in this repertoire.

**6...d5 7.exd5 Nxd5 8.d4**

White tries to open the centre as he is better developed and has already castled.

**8...cxd4**

This natural move is less precise.

**9.Nxd4 Be7**

Black accepts a pawn structure defect, but he needs to get castled.

**10.Nxc6 bxc6 11.Nd2**

The Knight heads towards c4. White is slightly better here due to the pawn structure.

### (28) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #28 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...e6**

The second most popular move for Black, only surpassed by 3...g6. Black's main idea is to go Nge7 to allow a recapture on c6 with a Knight. The other point is to support a later ....d5.

**4.O-O**

Here White's main alternative is 4.Bxc6, creating an imbalance in the position immediately. White gives up the pair of Bishops, but creates weaknesses in Black's camp. I prefer 4.O-O for our repertoire, because it is easier to learn and understand. If you'd like to expand your repertoire at a later stage I advise you to have a closer look at 4.Bxc6.

**4...Nge7**

**5.Re1**

**5...a6 6.Bf1**

**6...d5 7.exd5 Nxd5 8.d4**

**8...Nf6**

This is the best move. I think it is quite remarkable that Black can afford to further delay development, but concrete analysis shows that Black is very solid here.

**9.Be3 cxd4 10.Nxd4 Bd7 11.c4 Nxd4 12.Bxd4 Bc6 13.Nc3 Be7 14.a3**

White tries to set his majority in motion.

**14...a5 15.Qd3 O-O 16.Rad1**

White enjoys a small edge with his well-centralised pieces and chances to exploit the Queenside majority. This position was reached in the sample game Carlsen-Gelfand, London Candidates 2013. It is well worth studying the mentioned Carlsen game to get a better picture of this type of position.

### (29) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #29 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...d6**

Black intends to play Bd7 followed by a6 to question the Bishop. This plan is quite logical, but at the same time rather slow. I think that White has good prospects to get an edge against it. It is important to note that we might also get this position via 2...d6 3.Bb5+ Nc6.

**4.O-O Bd7**

This is by far the most popular and best move. Other moves delay the development even more and are quite risky.

**5.Re1 Nf6 6.c3 a6 7.Bf1 Bg4**

By far the most common move. In many cases Black will take on f3, giving us the Bishop pair. In return, Black gains some time to develop, as we will see in the main line. If Black tries to keep the Bishop by retreating to h5, White has excellent chances to get an early attack.

**8.h3 Bh5**

Very risky, but White needs to be very energetic now.

**9.g4 Bg6 10.d4**

The important point !

**10...cxd4**

Black has no good way to take e4, for example 10...Nxe4 11.d5 Nb8 12.Rxe4 Bxe4 13.Qa4+ or 10...Bxe4 11.Rxe4 Nxe4 12.d5 , using similar tactical ideas.

**11.cxd4 d5**

Taking the pawn fails, just like it does with c-pawns on the board.

**12.exd5**

Instead, 12.e5 and 13.e6 ! is strong as well, shutting in the f8-Bishop. I think 12.exd5 is just as strong and more straightforward. Black will have a very hard time surviving the next moves.<addz start="13.e6"/>

**12...Nxd5 13.Nc3 e6 14.Nxd5 Qxd5 15.Bg2**

And White has a great attack, based on the Ne5 idea and potential d4-d5 after the Queen leaves its post on d5.

### (30) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #30 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...d6**

**4.O-O Bd7**

**5.Re1 Nf6 6.c3 a6 7.Bf1 Bg4**

**8.h3 Bxf3**

This is best. Black keeps control over d4 for a while and White will lose some time by moving the Queen.

**9.Qxf3 g6 10.d3 Bg7 11.Be3**

Trying to play d3-d4 to build the ideal centre.

**11...Nd7**

Black has good control over d4, but we need to be persistent.

**12.Nd2 O-O 13.Qd1 b5 14.Nf3 b4 15.Qa4**

And a later d3-d4 gives White the better game. The position is opening up and we already have the Bishop pair.

### (31) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #31 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

This is the most popular reply. Black prepares the fianchetto and tries to increase control over d4 this way. It also emphases Kingside development more than the other moves. Note that White will castle on move 4, while Black's King will be in the centre for a while. This is not a big issue yet, as the position is closed, but further delaying it might be a cause for later concerns.

**4.O-O**

What could be more natural ? White's main alternative to 4.O-O is to play 4.Bxc6 , leading to a strategically very complicated battle. This is my recommendation if you like to expand your repertoire. Note that against 3...e6 we also go 4.O-O, while 4.Bxc6 is the other basic option there, as well. The Rossolimo is a rather versatile line, making it an ideal choice for any repertoire. You can start with one line and later add more variety, without needing to learn something entirely new.

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

This move is almost always useful to play. One point of the move is to allow Bf1. In this particular case we will actually take on c6 quite frequently, so this is not as important as in other situations.

**5...e6**

Mixing e6 and g6 does not work all that well here. White gets a solid edge now.

**6.Bxc6**

The most straightforward way. Instead 6.c3 is good as well.

**6...bxc6**

After 6...dxc6 7.e5 ! is very strong. White gets excellent control over the dark squares and the c8-Bishop remains a passive spectator. The next moves will be d3/Nbd2-c4 or e4. Note that f6 and d6 are tough for Black to cover.

**7.c3**

Aiming for a full centre. This is very much comparable to the scenario we examined after 5...a6 6.Bxc6 bxc6.

**7...Ne7 8.d4 cxd4 9.cxd4 O-O 10.Nc3 d6 11.Be3**

White is better, here, in the long term. Black's c6-pawn is not going away and the Black Bishops don't impress.

### (32) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #32 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...e5**

The only fully respectable alternative to 5...Nf6. Black clamps down on d4 and intends to develop with Nge7 next.

**6.Bxc6**

This is one of the few cases where I recommend taking on c6, when still relatively unprovoked. Here I believe that White has chances for a small edge, while the alternatives are either toothless or quite complicated (yet not fantastic) . If you like to explore something entirely different, have a look at 6.b4 !? This gives enough compensation and interesting play. As stated above - complicated, not fantastic, but worth a try as an additional option.

**6...bxc6**

This recapture leads to a comfortable game for White.

**7.c3**

We have seen on multiple occasions already that this approach is best after bxc6. White opens up the centre while being better developed, and ultimately aims to target central weaknesses. Contrary to general wisdom, it is quite often an idea to open the position against the Bishop pair - it's a matter of timing and often very much dependent on concrete factors.

**7...Ne7 8.d4 cxd4 9.cxd4 exd4 10.Nxd4 O-O 11.Nc3**

This sequence is basically forced after 7.c3. Black's main problem is that the pawns on d7 and c6 have problems moving to set up a reliable central structure. There will always be some square or pawn weakness that White might play against.

### (33) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #33 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...e5**

**6.Bxc6**

**6...dxc6**

This is more reliable than bxc6.

**7.d3 Ne7**

This looks natural, but I think White's task is easier, here, compared to 7...Qe7.

**8.Be3 b6 9.a3**

b2-b4 is the essential plan here. White opens up the Queenside to make it easier to attack the weaknesses.

**9...a5 10.Nbd2 Qc7 11.Nc4**

Note that Black has problems playing b5, as c5 would be fatally weakened. White's threat is b4 now.

**11...a4 12.b3**

And White opens up the Queenside favorably. Note how ineffective the e7-Knight and g7-Bishop are.

### (34) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #34 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...e5**

The only fully respectable alternative to 5...Nf6. Black clamps down on d4 and intends to develop with Nge7 next.

**6.Bxc6**

This is one of the few cases where I recommend taking on c6, when still relatively unprovoked. Here I believe that White has chances for a small edge, while the alternatives are either toothless or quite complicated (yet not fantastic) . If you like to explore something entirely different, have a look at 6.b4 !? This gives enough compensation and interesting play. As stated above - complicated, not fantastic, but worth a try as an additional option.

**6...dxc6**

**7.d3 Qe7**

This is played to cover e5 and thus prepare Nf6. Nf6 is the first step for a possible later Nd7-f8-e6-d4.

**8.a3**

White has quite a huge choice here. I like the direct 8.a3, but you may also go for 8.h3/8.Nbd2 etc - it's a slow position.

**8...Nf6 9.b4**

Here we go. White immediately opens it up. Of course, a slower course of action is also possible.

**9...O-O**

Taking twice on b4 is far too risky for Black.

**10.bxc5 Nd7**

Not the only move, but the structure will be the same after the alternatives.

**11.a4 Nxc5 12.Ba3**

And I prefer White. His position is very stable and we have some ideas on the Queenside. The pin on the c5-Knight is also quite annoying.

### (35) 1. Quickstarter Guide - Quickstarter Guide #35 - 1.e4 

**1.e4**

**1...c5**

**2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...Nf6 6.e5**

Grabbing space with tempo. 6.c3 is a good alternative if you wish to expand your repertoire.

**6...Nd5 7.Nc3 Nc7**

Taking on c3 is too accomodating. After 7...Nxc3 8.dxc3 O-O 9.Qd5 b6 10.Bf4 White gets nice pressure along the d-file and Black's development is lacking. Black is under severe pressure. White may also go for a Kingside attack with a later Rad1/Qd2/Bh6 setup. The e5-pawn is a huge asset that cuts the board in two.

**8.Bxc6 dxc6 9.Ne4**

The nice post on e4 is one major motivation behind advancing the e-pawn. This Knight may play a role in future Kingside play or will be used in the centre if Black later plays f6. But first of all c5 is attacked.

**9...Ne6**

This is the most popular and simple reply, but it forfeits the idea to develop the Bishop to g4.

**10.d3 O-O 11.Be3 b6 12.Qd2**

White aims for the Bishop trade. We will try to make Black's life uncomfortable on the Kingside while allowing very little on the Queenside. This position type does not look like a lot for White, but the score is very good as it is much simpler to handle for us. Black is mostly just sitting there without a clear active plan.

**12...Nd4**

This is the most solid and straightforward choice.

**13.Nxd4 cxd4 14.Bh6 c5**

Black sometimes starts with 14...Qd5 instead, but ...c5 will be played soon anyway, so it's not a big difference.

**15.Qf4 Bb7 16.h4**

The main point of White's play is that the pawn on e5 allows this Kingside initiative, and if Black wants to solve this completely he will very likely have to play ...f6 at some point. This has to be well prepared, though, as White might double on the e-file quicker.This does not amount to all that much, but White's position is simpler to play, here. This is also supported by the scores that favour White quite heavily. Note that Black has no active ideas at all, and this means White's position is very safe.

### (264) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

This is the Rossolimo variation, our choice against 2...Nc6. Nowadays this is not a sideline anymore, but possibly White's main try for an advantage, which avoids entering the open Sicilian with 3 d4. At the professional level, the main reason for avoiding the open Sicilian after ...Nc6 is the Sveshnikov variation after 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5. White struggles to find anything against it, so many Pros have switched to 3 Bb5. For our purposes the Rossolimo is a very logical choice as it is based on very sound principles, including quick development and good pawn structures. The positions are usually more strategic in nature, and it is possible to find them over the board in case you have forgotten what you looked at before the game. Black has a plethora of options against the Rossolimo. But don't feel too intimidated as none of them require extremely detailed knowledge to avoid trouble. You will be OK with common sense moves and frequently get good positions using the ideas presented in this repertoire.

**3...e6**

The second most popular move for Black, only surpassed by 3...g6. Black's main idea is to go ...Nge7 to allow a recapture on ...c6 with a Knight. The other point is to support a later ...d5.

**4.O-O**

Here White's main alternative is 4.Bxc6 , creating an imbalance in the position immediately. White gives up the pair of Bishops, but creates weaknesses in Black's camp. I prefer 4 O-O for our repertoire, because it is easier to learn and understand. If you like to expand your repertoire at a later stage I advise you to have a closer look at 4 Bxc6.

**4...Nf6**

Very rare and not particularly good.

**5.e5**

There is nothing wrong with other sensible moves like 5.Re1 Or 5.Bxc6 either.

**5...Nd5 6.Nc3 Nxc3 7.dxc3**

It is important to take like this as it gives an even greater edge in development. A quick Bf4 will make it hard for Black to get the Bc8 in play.

### (265) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...e6**

**4.O-O**

**4...a6 5.Bxc6**

OK, if Black insists we will take it. This now transposes to a6.

### (266) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...e6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Nge7**

This is most consistent with e6. Black prepares ...a6 and/ or ...d5.

**5.Re1**

White has to commit regarding his Bishop on b5. He may play 5.c3 , signalling his intention to drop it to b3/c2 later. This has some similarities to the Ruy Lopez. My choice is 5 Re1 in order to drop it back to f1 and then expand in the centre. Both moves are good and of roughly equal value theoretically.

**5...Nd4**

A rare move, but not bad. Usually Black goes for this when White has committed a Knight to c3, so a capture on d4 loses further time. As there is no Knight on c3, we should be able to get a small advantage here.

**6.Nxd4 cxd4 7.d3**

White will place the Bishop on b3 and then try to start central/kingside play with f4, as well as transfer a Knight to f3. A sample line for this strategy goes...

**7...a6 8.Ba4 b5 9.Bb3 Nc6 10.Nd2 Bb7 11.f4 Qc7 12.Nf3**

Here I prefer White slightly, but Black is not in bad shape either. f4-f5 is a key for White later.

### (267) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...e6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Nge7**

**5.Re1**

**5...Ng6**

Black prepares Be7 and O-O.

**6.c3**

Our goal is to get a full centre, so this makes a lot of sense.

**6...d5 7.exd5 Qxd5**

A mix of the Rossolimo and Alapin Sicilian. It looks a bit odd to me, but is not so bad for Black.

**8.d4**

This is logical, trying to use the better development.

**8...cxd4 9.Nxd4 Bd7**

Nxc6 was a serious threat, so this is best.

**10.Bd3**

I suggest to play this new move, leading to sharp play in the centre. The idea is to play the Bishop to e4.

**10...Nxd4 11.Be4 Qd6 12.cxd4 Bc6 13.Nc3**

We are now threatening to push d4-d5, the Black King is still in the middle of the board.

**13...Be7**

This move is played to block the e-file.

**14.h4**

A really cool engine suggestion that keeps the initiative.

**14...Rd8 15.h5 Nh4 16.Qg4**

This is also very dangerous for Black.

### (268) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...e6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Nge7**

**5.Re1**

**5...Ng6**

**6.c3**

**6...d5 7.exd5 Qxd5**

**8.d4**

**8...cxd4 9.Nxd4 Bd7**

**10.Bd3**

**10...Nxd4 11.Be4 Qd6 12.cxd4 Bc6 13.Nc3**

**13...Be7**

**14.h4**

**14...Nxh4**

This is the critical choice for Black. The Bishop could not take due to d4-d5

**15.d5 exd5 16.Nxd5 Ng6 17.Be3**

With a strong initiative for White. I could continue this line further, but you have stop at some point. Black may equalize with precise play, but learning moves up to move 30 is too much.

### (269) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...e6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Nge7**

**5.Re1**

**5...Ng6**

**6.c3**

**6...a6 7.Bf1 Be7 8.d4 cxd4 9.cxd4 d5 10.e5**

And we have reached a position more typical of the French Defence. I think White is fine here as Black still has his Bc8 problem and a later f6 gives White a ready made target on e6.

**10...O-O 11.Nc3 f6 12.exf6 Bxf6 13.Be3**

And the structure gives White a slight edge.

### (270) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...e6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Nge7**

**5.Re1**

**5...a6 6.Bf1**

**6...Ng6 7.c3**

leads to the line starting with Ng6, examined earlier.

### (271) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...e6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Nge7**

**5.Re1**

**5...a6 6.Bf1**

**6...g6**

The moves ...e6 and ...g6 usually don't mix well if White is able to open the centre quickly. This is one of those cases. White needs to act quickly to exploit the weak d6 square.

**7.d4 cxd4 8.Nxd4**

This is a bad version of of an open Sicilian. Let's have a look.

**8...Bg7 9.Nxc6 Nxc6 10.Nc3 O-O 11.Bf4**

This is the problem. Black is stuck with the Bishop on c8 and central weaknesses.

### (272) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...e6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Nge7**

**5.Re1**

**5...a6 6.Bf1**

**6...d5 7.exd5 Qxd5**

This is better than it looks. Black tries to keep control over d4, thus trying to prevent a further opening of the position.

**8.Na3**

Important move - White eyes the b6 weaknesses.

**8...Qd8**

That move is hard to avoid, Nc4 would force it on the next move, anyway.

**9.Nc4 Nf5 10.a4 b6 11.c3**

And White has Qb3 in store with some pressure.

### (273) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...e6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Nge7**

**5.Re1**

**5...a6 6.Bf1**

**6...d5 7.exd5 exd5**

This is pretty awful, but I am still surprised that is was not played a single time in my database.

**8.d4**

Black is in deep trouble with the King in the centre and the development lagging.

**8...cxd4 9.Nxd4 Nxd4 10.Qxd4**

And Black is probably losing the d5 pawn in the long run.

### (274) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...e6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Nge7**

**5.Re1**

**5...a6 6.Bf1**

**6...d5 7.exd5 Nxd5 8.d4**

White tries to open the centre as he is better developed and already castled.

**8...cxd4**

**9.Nxd4 Nxd4 10.Qxd4**

And Black has no good follow up to prepare castling short. Normal developing moves give White a good game here.

### (275) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...e6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Nge7**

**5.Re1**

**5...a6 6.Bf1**

**6...d5 7.exd5 Nxd5 8.d4**

**8...cxd4**

**9.Nxd4 Be7**

**10.Nxc6 bxc6 11.Nd2**

### (276) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...e6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Nge7**

**5.Re1**

**5...a6 6.Bf1**

**6...d5 7.exd5 Nxd5 8.d4**

**8...Be7**

White gets a comfortable edge now, as Black is not well prepared for the opening of the position.

**9.dxc5 Bxc5 10.c4 Nf6 11.Qxd8+ Nxd8 12.Nc3**

White is in very good shape here. Note that Na4/ Be3/Bf4 ideas are coming to exploit the weak dark squares. There is also the simple a3/b4 plan to put more pressure on Black .

### (277) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...e6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Nge7**

This is most consistent with e6. Black prepares ...a6 and/ or . ..d5.

**5.Re1**

**5...a6 6.Bf1**

**6...d5 7.exd5 Nxd5 8.d4**

**8...Be7**

**9.dxc5 O-O 10.a3 Bxc5 11.b4 Be7 12.c4 Nf6 13.Qc2**

And White is much better already. Space, better central control and the much better Bishops add up. Bf4/c5 will also create a potential outpost on d6.

### (278) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...e6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Nge7**

**5.Re1**

**5...a6 6.Bf1**

**6...d5 7.exd5 Nxd5 8.d4**

**8...Nf6**

**9.Be3 Be7**

Black delays the capture on d4.

**10.dxc5**

If White goes 10.c4 instead, it will often transpose to the main line. However, there is the irritating move 11...Ng4 that I want to avoid by taking on c5 now.<skip start="11...Ng4"/>

**10...Qxd1 11.Rxd1 Ng4 12.Bf4 Bxc5 13.Bg3 h5**

This is necessary. Black needs to initiate concrete play, otherwise h3 will send the Knight back and, with simple moves like c4, Nc3, a3, b4 etc., White will be better.

**14.Rd2**

We need to cover f2 to defuse ...h4.

**14...h4 15.Bc7**

Instead 15.Nxh4 Nxh2 ! leads nowhere. White now intends to play Nc3-e4 if possible. It's a complicated game with chances for both sides.

### (279) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...e6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Nge7**

**5.Re1**

**5...a6 6.Bf1**

**6...d5 7.exd5 Nxd5 8.d4**

**8...Nf6**

**9.Be3 cxd4 10.Nxd4 Nxd4**

This will often just transpose to the main line.

**11.Bxd4 Be7 12.c4**

This is the transposition to Bd7. Instead 12.a4 is also a fine idea, trying to keep c4 free for the Knight at a later stage.

### (280) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...e6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Nge7**

**5.Re1**

**5...a6 6.Bf1**

**6...d5 7.exd5 Nxd5 8.d4**

**8...Nf6**

**9.Be3 cxd4 10.Nxd4 Bd7 11.c4 Nxd4 12.Bxd4 Bc6 13.Nc3 Be7 14.a3**

**14...a5 15.Qd3 O-O 16.Rad1**

This position was reached in the well known game Carlsen-Gelfand, London Candidates 2013. White enjoys a small edge with his well centralised pieces and chances to exploit the queenside majority. It is well worth studying the mentioned Carlsen game to get a better picture of this type of position.

### (281) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Nf6**

This is a sideline, but somewhat underestimated in my opinion. It is not easy to prove anything against it. Usually 4 Nc3 is viewed as critical, but this might get very complicated, which I feel is not warranted for a rather rare line.

**4.e5**

�@� r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 3 This will lead to positions that are very similar to the line starting with 3...g6 4.O-O Bg7 5.Re1 Nf6 6.e5. This was my main reason to go with 4 e5 here. It is easier to play and heads to middlegames that are part of our repertoire anyway.

**4...Ng4**

Ambitious, but probably not that great.

**5.Bxc6**

e5 was exposed, so there is no choice. We gain lots of time though, which gives ample compensation for the loss of the Bishop pair.

**5...bxc6**

This is very slow and should give White a strong initiative. We need to open the position now, as usual after bxc6.

**6.O-O**

This is useful anyway. It is not easy to suggest moves now for Black. Extreme care is needed to avoid a quick loss.

**6...Qc7 7.Re1 e6 8.d4**

Just one example. White is attacking in the centre and might exploit the weak dark squares in Black's camp.

### (282) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Nf6**

**4.e5**

**4...Ng4**

**5.Bxc6**

**5...dxc6 6.O-O**

This is a familiar pawn structure in our repertoire. Here the key issue is the g4 Knight that will drop back to h6, probably going next to f5. Now a major difference to other lines is that White has not yet played the b1 Knight to c3. Let's look at a sample line to illustrate this.

**6...g6**

No other way to develop the Kingside.

**7.d3 Bg7 8.Qe2 Nh6 9.h3 O-O 10.Bf4 Nf5 11.c3**

And after due prep White will threaten g2-g4. Black is under some pressure, and White's position is much easier to play.

### (283) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Nf6**

**4.e5**

**4...Nd5 5.O-O g6 6.Re1 Bg7 7.Nc3**

This is a frequently seen transposition to our main line after g6.

### (284) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Nf6**

**4.e5**

**4...Nd5 5.O-O Nc7 6.Bxc6 bxc6**

**7.Re1**

This is aiming for a transposition again. Black has no good way to avoid it.

**7...g6**

**8.Nc3 Bg7 9.Na4**

�@� r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 3 This is usually reached via 3...g6 4.O-O Bg7 5.Re1 Nf6 6.e5 Nd5 7.Nc3 Nc7 8.Bxc6 bxc6 ?! 9.Na4 ! White is better, please see the main line for further info on it.

### (285) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Nf6**

**4.e5**

**4...Nd5 5.O-O Nc7 6.Bxc6 dxc6 7.h3**

**7...g6 8.Re1 Bg7 9.d3 Ne6 10.Nbd2**

10.Nc3 is also possible, but this would be a slightly better version of the g6 main line as White has played h3, which he does not need to do in the g6 line. I like the idea to play 10 Nbd2 here.

**10...O-O 11.a4**

**11...a5 12.Nf1 Qc7 13.Bd2**

White's idea is to play Qc1 and Bh6. The f1 Knight might be activated with Nh2-g4. I like White here, but Black is quite solid of course.

### (286) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...d6**

Thi@ move is one of the more popular lines against the Rossolimo. Black intends to play ...Bd7 followed by ...a6 to question the Bishop. This plan is quite logical, but at the same time rather slow. I think that White has good prospects to get an edge against it. rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2 It is important to note that we might also get this position via 2...d6 3.Bb5+ Nc6.

**4.O-O Bg4**

This move is quite ambitious, trying to set up a counter pin on our Knight.

**5.c3**

d4-d5 would be nice to get in, so White prepares the central expansion.

**5...Qb6**

Continuing with ambitious play. Of course, Black may go with a slow move, but White has an easy game with moves like d2-d4, Re1 etc. Black is still some moves away from castling.

**6.Ba4 Nf6 7.d4 O-O-O**

This looks crazy, but it has been played by the strong GM Tiviakov. White is a lot better though.

**8.Bxc6 Qxc6 9.d5 Qa6 10.Nbd2**

And White will continue with c3-c4, maybe b3 and Bb2. It's just a Benoni where Black's King and Queen are strangely placed. White might also go for a b4-based plan instead.

### (287) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...d6**

**4.O-O a6 5.Bxc6+**

and after 5...bxc6 will transpose to 3...a6.

### (288) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...d6**

**4.O-O Bd7**

This is by far the most popular and best move. Others delay the development even more and are quite risky.

**5.Re1 a6**

Usually Black goes ...Nf6 first, then ...a6. This early ...a6 will transpose most of the time.

**6.Bf1 Nf6 7.c3**

Transposes to the main line starting with ...Nf6.

### (289) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...d6**

**4.O-O Bd7**

**5.Re1 a6**

Usually Black goes Nf6 first, then ...a6. This early . ..a6 will transpose most of the time.

**6.Bf1 Bg4 7.c3 Nf6 8.h3**

And again we have transposed to the main line.

### (290) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...d6**

**4.O-O Bd7**

**5.Re1 Nf6 6.c3 a6 7.Bf1 e5**

The only serious alternative to Bg4, staking a claim in the centre.

**8.h3**

White spends a tempo avoiding the pin after d2-d4. You may play 8.d4 immediately, but after 8...cxd4 9.cxd4 Bg4 you need to deal with the c6-Knight coming to d4 , in many cases. It is something I like to avoid, but it is not objectively bad for White.

**8...g5**

This has quite some shock value, but I am still amazed that GM Simon Williams has played it four times (!) . If White reacts well it is almost unplayable.

**9.d4**

I think this is easier to handle than taking on g5.

**9...g4 10.hxg4 Bxg4 11.d5 Ne7 12.Bg5 Ng6 13.Nbd2**

The general problem with Black's position is that he has a bunch of long term weaknesses and there is no adequate counterplay.

**13...h6 14.Bxf6 Qxf6 15.Qa4+ Bd7 16.Qb3 b5 17.a4 c4 18.Qb4 a5 19.axb5**

And White was winning in Burg-Williams, Amsterdam 2014.

### (291) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...d6**

**4.O-O Bd7**

**5.Re1 Nf6 6.c3 a6 7.Bf1 e5**

**8.h3**

**8...Be7 9.d4 O-O 10.d5 Na7 11.a4 b5 12.axb5 axb5 13.b4**

White is slightly better here at least. It looks a lot like an old-fashioned line of the Chigorin Ruy that I used to play as Black. Note that White has an idea of Re2-a2 there that is not available in the Ruy.

### (292) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...d6**

**4.O-O Bd7**

**5.Re1 Nf6 6.c3 a6 7.Bf1 Bg4**

**8.h3 Bh5**

**9.g4 Bg6 10.d4**

**10...cxd4 11.cxd4 Nxe4 12.d5 Nb8 13.Rxe4 Bxe4 14.Qa4+**

That's the tactical point of 10 d4 ! The Pawn cannot be taken.

### (293) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

This is the Rossolimo variation, our choice against Nc6. Nowadays this is not a sideline anymore, but possibly White's main try for an advantage, which avoids entering the open Sicilian with 3 d4. At the professional level, the main reason for avoiding the open Sicilian after Nc6 is the Sveshnikov variation after 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 Nf6 5 Nc3 e5. White struggles to find anything against it, so many Pros have switched to 3 Bb5. For our purposes the Rossolimo is a very logical choice as it is based on very sound principles, including quick development and good pawn structures. The positions are usually more strategic in nature, and it is possible to find them over the board in case you have forgotten what you looked at before the game. Black has a plethora of options against the Rossolimo. But don't feel too intimidated as none of them require extremely detailed knowledge to avoid trouble. You will be OK with common sense moves and frequently get good positions using the ideas presented in this repertoire.

**3...d6**

This move is one of the more popular lines against the Rossolimo. Black intends to play Bd7 followed by a6 to question the Bishop. This plan is quite logical, but at the same time rather slow. I think that White has good prospects to get an edge against it. It is important to note that we might also get this position via d6 3 Bb5+ Nc6.

**4.O-O Bd7**

**5.Re1 Nf6 6.c3 a6 7.Bf1 Bg4**

**8.h3 Bh5**

**9.g4 Bg6 10.d4**

**10...cxd4 11.cxd4 Bxe4 12.Rxe4 Nxe4 13.d5 Nb8 14.Qa4+**

### (294) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...d6**

**4.O-O Bd7**

**5.Re1 Nf6 6.c3 a6 7.Bf1 Bg4**

**8.h3 Bh5**

**9.g4 Bg6 10.d4**

**10...cxd4 11.cxd4 d5 12.exd5**

Instead, 12.e5 and 13 e6 ! is strong as well, shutting in the f8-Bishop. I think 12 exd5 is just as strong and more straightforward. Black will have a very hard time surviving the next moves.

**12...Nxd5 13.Nc3 e6 14.Nxd5 Qxd5 15.Bg2**

### (295) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...d6**

**4.O-O Bd7**

**5.Re1 Nf6 6.c3 a6 7.Bf1 Bg4**

**8.h3 Bh5**

**9.g4 Bg6 10.d4**

**10...Nxe4 11.d5 Nb8 12.Rxe4 Bxe4 13.Qa4+**

That's the tactical point of 10 d4 ! The Pawn cannot be taken.

### (296) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...d6**

**4.O-O Bd7**

**5.Re1 Nf6 6.c3 a6 7.Bf1 Bg4**

**8.h3 Bh5**

**9.g4 Bg6 10.d4**

**10...Bxe4 11.Rxe4 Nxe4 12.d5 Nb8 13.Qa4+ Nd7 14.Qxe4**

That's the tactical point of 10 d4 ! The Pawn cannot be taken.

### (297) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...d6**

**4.O-O Bd7**

**5.Re1 Nf6 6.c3 a6 7.Bf1 Bg4**

**8.h3 Bh5**

**9.g4 Bg6 10.d4**

**10...e5**

Not ideal, but relatively best compared to the alternatives.

**11.d5 Nb8 12.Nh4**

White is better here due to his space advantage and excellent Knight post on f5 to come.

### (298) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...d6**

**4.O-O Bd7**

**5.Re1 Nf6 6.c3 a6 7.Bf1 Bg4**

**8.h3 Bxf3**

This is almost certainly best. Black keeps control over d4 for a while and White will lose some time by moving the Queen.

**9.Qxf3 e6**

Here Black prepares d6-d5, which often leads to French type positions. White needs to regroup, now, and develop the queenside.

**10.d3 Be7 11.Nd2 O-O 12.Qd1**

The plan is to go Nf3 and d3-d4.

**12...d5 13.e5 Nd7 14.Nf3**

And we have reached the mentioned French type position. Black is OK here, but we still have the Bishop pair for a long-term advantage. Note also that f7-f6 is tougher to play without the light squared Bishop - there are downsides to trading this often problematic piece for Black.

### (299) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**5.Re1 Nf6 6.c3 a6 7.Bf1 Bg4**

**8.h3 Bxf3**

**9.Qxf3 g6 10.d3 Bg7 11.Be3**

**11...Nd7**

**12.Nd2 O-O 13.Qd1 b5 14.Nf3 b4 15.Qa4**

And a later d3-d4 gives White the better game. The position is opening up and we already have the bishop pair.

### (300) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...a6**

To be honest, I always thought that this move makes little sense, but closer study revealed that it is not as bad as I thought. Against the main lines e6/g6/d6 White often takes on c6 completely unprovoked on move 4, so why encourage the trade ? In addition having the pawn on a6 is rather a negative compared to the pawn position on a7 as b6 is weakened. As mentioned previously, things are not as simple as you might think - White is better, but needs to be precise.

**4.Bxc6 bxc6 5.O-O d6 6.e5**

This is a very strong move ! (White is also better after other sensible moves, like. 6 c3, but this is very powerful.)

**6...d5**

Otherwise the position, and especially the e-file, will open even more quickly. After giving up the Bishop pair White will usually need compensation in the form of a structural weakness (exploitable doubled pawns) or a lead in development.

**7.h3**

White has scored 100% in my database from here. A later b3, Ba3, Nc3-a4 plan will often just win the c5 pawn.

### (301) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...a6**

**4.Bxc6 bxc6 5.O-O d5**

This weakens c5 enormously. It looks a lot like a reversed Nimzo Saemisch but with White being two tempi up.

**6.d3 Bg4 7.h3 Bh5 8.c4**

**8...dxe4**

**9.dxe4 Qxd1 10.Rxd1 Bxf3 11.gxf3 e6 12.Nc3 Nf6 13.Na4 Be7 14.Be3**

**14...Nd7 15.f4**

### (302) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...a6**

**4.Bxc6 dxc6**

I think this is better than bxc6 as it at least opens up the c8 Bishop.

**5.O-O Bg4 6.h3 Bxf3 7.Qxf3**

This gives White an easy game. We will play with d3 and a later f4 plan after Qe2/Qg3.

### (303) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...a6**

**4.Bxc6 dxc6**

**5.O-O Bg4 6.h3 Bh5 7.d3 Qc7**

This makes the most sense. Black goes for ...e5 and prevents a possible g4/Ne5 plan.

**8.Nbd2**

There is nothing wrong with Be3 either, but quickly going to c4 with the Knight seems very sensible, to me.

**8...e5 9.Nc4 Bd6 10.a4**

White now threatens to play a4-a5, fixing the Black weaknesses on the queenside.

**10...a5 11.g4 Bg6 12.Nh4**

A future Nf5 and/or f2-f4 will give White a very comfortable game.

### (304) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...a6**

**4.Bxc6 dxc6**

**5.O-O Qc7**

�@� r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 3 This is the main move and often reached via a different move order 3...Qc7 4.O-O a6 5.Bxc6 dxc6 !?. Black intends to play ...e5 and clamp down on the d4-square.

**6.a4**

I like this direct approach. But there is nothing fundamentally wrong with 6.d3 either.

**6...a5**

The most standard reply, preventing the clamping move a4-a5.

**7.d4**

An interesting idea. White trades off one of the weak Black pawns, but in return opens up the position, which makes sense as White is ahead in development. Note that the Black queenside squares are still weak and now actually exploitable. In a more closed position it is tough to get anywhere on the queenside.

**7...cxd4 8.Qxd4 Bg4 9.Nbd2 Rd8 10.Qe5 Qxe5 11.Nxe5 Be6 12.Nec4**

And Black has severe problems with his queenside. White is much better. Note that b3, followed by Bb2-c3 is a simple way to increase the pressure.

### (305) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Qc7**

This move is mostly played to allow a recapture on c6 with the Queen. There is one substantial drawback, however - Black further delays kingside development and castling.

**4.O-O a6**

**5.Bxc6 dxc6 6.a4**

transposes to a6.

### (306) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Qc7**

**4.O-O a6**

**5.Bxc6 Qxc6 6.Nc3**

**6...e6 7.d4 cxd4 8.Nxd4**

**8...Qc7 9.Re1**

### (307) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Qb6**

This move is a relative of 3...Qc7, but a bit more challenging as we are provoked to play an early Nc3, which limits our options. Still, Black has problems equalizing, again, due to his sluggish development.

**4.Nc3 e6 5.Bxc6**

This is important and a bit surprising at first, but you will see how dangerous it is to take now. If we wait until Nge7 is played it will be much more difficult to come up with an aggressive play to open up the position.

**5...bxc6**

Not the most logical looking move ever, but after seeing the problems following the Queen recapture, it is understandable that it has been tried in some games.

**6.O-O d5 7.d3**

A later b3/Na4/Ba3 plan will be strong. Note how ineffective Black's c8 bishop is.

### (308) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Qb6**

This move is a relative of 3. ..Qc7, but a bit more challenging as we are provoked to play an early Nc3, which limits our options. Still, Black has problems equalizing, again, due to his sluggish development.

**4.Nc3 e6 5.Bxc6**

**5...Qxc6 6.d4 cxd4 7.Nxd4 Qc7 8.O-O a6**

This transposes to a line usually arising from Qc7. Going ...a6 looks very slow, but Black can hardly allow Ndb5 ideas.

**9.Re1**

This position is identical to a line starting with Qc7. Black is under serious pressure.

### (309) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Nd4**

This move is somewhat premature. The Knight jump to d4 is quite common in positions where White already has a Knight on c3 . In these cases, taking on d4 loses time as c3 is immediately attacked. Here White has not committed to anything, yet, so he can adapt perfectly to the pawn structure change that Black initiates.

**4.Nxd4 cxd4 5.O-O**

White has more than one decent plan now. One idea is to go for a d3/f4 plan and play on the kingside. The Bishop often drops back to b3, then. The alternative option is to play c3, trying to open the position.

**5...g6 6.c3**

As mentioned, there is also d3 etc.

**6...Bg7 7.cxd4 Bxd4 8.Qa4 Qb6 9.Na3**

And White is a lot better. Black's piece placement is shaky and tough to handle.

### (310) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

This is the Rossolimo variation, our choice against 2...Nc6. Nowadays this is not a sideline anymore, but possibly White's main try for an advantage, which avoids entering the open Sicilian with 3 d4. At the professional level, the main reason for avoiding the open Sicilian after 2...Nc6 is the Sveshnikov variation after 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5. White struggles to find anything against it, so many Pros have switched to 3 Bb5. For our purposes the Rossolimo is a very logical choice as it is based on very sound principles, including quick development and good pawn structures. The positions are usually more strategic in nature, and it is possible to find them over the board in case you have forgotten what you looked at before the game. Black has a plethora of options against the Rossolimo. But don't feel too intimidated as none of them require extremely detailed knowledge to avoid trouble. You will be OK with common sense moves and frequently get good positions using the ideas presented in this repertoire.

**3...Na5**

A Knight on the rim is dim. Well, sometimes this saying is actually true ! In the given case this funny Knight jump is not completely terrible, but certainly not great.

**4.c3**

This probably fits best with our repertoire. Just going for d2-d4 in open Sicilian style is also fine though: 4.O-O and then d2-d4 without c3 first.

**4...a6 5.Be2 Nf6**

On other slower moves we will just go d2-d4, of course.

**6.e5 Nd5 7.O-O e6 8.d4 cxd4 9.Qxd4**

White is slightly better, here. Note that Qg4 is a good way to continue and put pressure on Black's kingside.

### (311) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...e5**

This move has gotten some modest popularity in recent years, due to the original development plan that we will see soon.

**4.O-O Bd6**

This probably would have gotten some bad press 100 years ago, but it is not that bad. The position is quite closed, so Black can afford some liberties. I still think it does not equalize though.

**5.c3 Nge7 6.d4**

Most straightforward, but you may also go with a slow d3 based plan here. This is slower and less challenging, but also OK if you like a manoeuvring game more.

**6...cxd4 7.cxd4 exd4 8.Nxd4 a6 9.Bc4 O-O 10.Nf3**

This is an important move. White avoids trades as Black is still somewhat ill-coordinated. Now normal developing moves should conserve White's edge.

### (312) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

The most popular reply. Black prepares the fianchetto and tries to increase control over d4 this way. It also emphases kingside development more than the other moves. Note that White will castle on move 4, while Black's King will be in the centre for a while. This is not a big issue yet, as the position is closed, but further delaying it might be a cause for later concerns.

**4.O-O**

What could be more natural ? White's main alternative to 4 O-O is to play 4.Bxc6 , leading to a strategically very complicated battle. This is my recommendation if you like to expand your repertoire. Note that against ...e6 we also go 4 O-O, while 4 Bxc6 is the other basic option there, as well. The Rossolimo is a rather versatile line, making it an ideal choice for any repertoire. You can start with one line and later add more variety, without needing to learn something entirely new.

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...e5**

The only fully respectable alternative to Nf6. Black clamps down on d4 and intends to develop with Nge7 next.

**6.Bxc6**

**6...bxc6**

**7.c3**

**7...Ne7 8.d4 cxd4 9.cxd4 exd4 10.Nxd4 O-O 11.Nc3**

This sequence is basically forced after 7 c3. Black's main problem is that the pawns on d7 and c6 have problems moving to set up a reliable central structure. There will always be some square or pawn weakness that White might play against.

**11...h6**

Black prevents Bg5, but it is very slow.

**12.Bf4 d6 13.Qd2 g5 14.Bg3 Re8 15.Rad1**

This looks terrible for Black. d6 is just too weak.

### (313) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...e5**

**6.Bxc6**

**6...bxc6**

**7.c3**

**7...Ne7 8.d4 cxd4 9.cxd4 exd4 10.Nxd4 O-O 11.Nc3**

**11...d5 12.exd5 cxd5 13.Bg5**

And White is already close to winning.

### (314) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...e5**

**6.Bxc6**

**6...bxc6**

**7.c3**

**7...Ne7 8.d4 cxd4 9.cxd4 exd4 10.Nxd4 O-O 11.Nc3**

**11...Rb8**

That's the most often played move and maybe the one that poses the hardest challenge for White.

**12.Nb3**

White threatens Bf4-d6 now, with a deadly bind.

**12...d5 13.Bf4**

This very natural move is a novelty, suggested by Stockfish.

**13...Rb4 14.Qd2**

Introducing Nxd5 into the position.

**14...a5 15.Bg5 d4 16.Rad1**

This is still complicated, but fine for White.

### (315) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...e5**

**6.Bxc6**

**6...dxc6**

**7.d3 Ne7**

This looks natural, but I think White's task is easier, here, compared to Qe7.

**8.Be3 b6 9.a3**

b2-b4 is the essential plan, here. White opens up the queenside to make it easier to attack the weaknesses.

**9...O-O 10.b4 cxb4 11.axb4 Qc7 12.Nbd2 f5 13.Nc4**

And White is better. He has some weaknesses to attack and is very harmoniously placed.

### (316) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...e5**

**6.Bxc6**

**6...dxc6**

**7.d3 Ne7**

**8.Be3 b6 9.a3**

**9...a5 10.Nbd2 Qc7 11.Nc4**

**11...a4 12.b3**

And White opens up the queenside favorably. Note how ineffective Ne7 and Bg7 are.

### (317) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...e5**

**6.Bxc6**

**6...dxc6**

**7.d3 Qe7**

**8.a3**

White has quite a huge choice here. I like the direct 8 a3, but you may also go for: 8.h3 Or 8.Nbd2 etc., it's a slow position.

**8...a5 9.Be3 Nf6 10.a4**

Freezing the queenside. We won't manage b2-b4 anymore, so we need a new plan.

**10...O-O 11.Na3 b6 12.Nc4 Nd7 13.b3**

White's idea is to play f2-f4 in the very long run. Before this is possible, we need to either trade the dark squared Bishops or provoke f7-f6, by Black. Note that the trade of Bishops makes sense, as after a later f2-f4 break the dark squares will be weak in Black's camp. The Bishop on g7 looks weaker than the Be3, but Black's Bishop is an important defender.

### (318) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...e5**

**6.Bxc6**

**6...dxc6**

**7.d3 Qe7**

**8.a3**

**8...Nf6 9.b4**

**9...cxb4**

This is a concession. Black cannot grab b4 anyway, so it makes little sense to take now.

**10.axb4 Qxb4 11.Ba3 Qb6 12.Nbd2**

And White's attack is very strong, almost winning.

### (319) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...e5**

**6.Bxc6**

**6...dxc6**

**7.d3 Qe7**

**8.a3**

**8...Nf6 9.b4**

**9...cxb4**

**10.axb4 O-O 11.h3**

White is slightly better here. We have some targets on the queenside, in the long run, and Black's counterplay is less obvious.

### (320) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...e5**

**6.Bxc6**

**6...dxc6**

**7.d3 Qe7**

**8.a3**

**8...Nf6 9.b4**

**9...O-O 10.bxc5 Nd7**

Not the only move, but the structure will be the same after the alternatives.

**11.a4 Nxc5 12.Ba3**

And I prefer White. His position is very stable and we have some ideas on the queenside. The pin on Nc5 is also quite annoying.

### (321) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...a6**

A rare move, but it is useful to see how it is handled.

**6.Bxc6 dxc6 7.d3**

Now Black will probably play either Nf6 or e5, both of which lead to slightly worse versions of the main lines. It's hard to suggest something fundamentally different for Black at this point.

### (322) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6 bxc6 7.c3**

It is important to understand that White needs to play c3 and d4, here, exploiting his lead in development. If you play passively, Black might get in d6/e5 and f5 and gain a space advantage.

**7...Nf6 8.d4 cxd4 9.cxd4 O-O 10.Nc3 d6 11.h3**

White will develop with Bf4/Qd2/Rc1. Trading with Bh6 would be useful, of course. It is important to note that it is hard for Black to get rid of his potentially weak c-pawn.

### (323) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6 bxc6 7.c3**

**7...Nf6 8.d4 cxd4 9.cxd4 O-O 10.Nc3 d5 11.e5 Ne4 12.Nd2**

This is a lot better than taking the pawn on e4, which would have given Black some activity on the light squares as good compensation.

**12...Nxc3 13.bxc3 c5 14.Nb3 c4 15.Nc5**

This is very nice for White. Black's Bishops play no important role while the Knight is quite annoying on c5.

### (324) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...e6**

**6.Bxc6**

**6...dxc6 7.e5**

This is very strong. White gets excellent control over the dark squares and the c8 Bishop remains a passive spectator. Next moves will be d3/Nbd2-c4 or e4. Note that f6 and d6 are tough for Black to cover.

### (325) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...e6**

**6.Bxc6**

**6...bxc6 7.c3**

�@� r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 4 5 Aiming for a full centre. This is very much comparable to the scenario we examined after 5...a6 6.Bxc6 bxc6.

**7...Ne7 8.d4 cxd4 9.cxd4 O-O 10.Nc3 d6 11.Be3**

White is better, here, in the long term. Black's c6 pawn is not going away and the Black bishops don't impress.

### (326) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...Nf6 6.e5**

**6...Nd5 7.Nc3 Nxc3**

This is too accommodating. White now gets nice pressure along the d-file and Black's development is lacking.

**8.dxc3 O-O 9.Qd5 b6 10.Bf4**

Black is under severe pressure. White may also go for a kingside attack with a later Rad1/Qd2/Bh6 setup. The e5 pawn is huge asset that cuts the board in two.

### (327) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...Nf6 6.e5**

**6...Nd5 7.Nc3 Nc7 8.Bxc6 bxc6**

A rare move that neglects development.

**9.Na4**

This is a novelty suggested by Stockfish. Usually White plays 9.Ne4 , here, and is comfortable, but 9 Na4 seems even better.

**9...Ne6 10.b3 O-O 11.Bb2 d6**

**12.exd6**

**12...exd6 13.Bxg7 Nxg7 14.d4 cxd4 15.Qxd4**

### (328) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...Nf6 6.e5**

**6...Nd5 7.Nc3 Nc7 8.Bxc6 dxc6 9.Ne4**

The nice post on e4 is one major motivation behind advancing the e-pawn. This Knight may play a role for coming kingside play or will be used in the centre after Black plays f6, in the future. First of all, c5 is attacked.

**9...b6**

This is more ambitious than Ne6, but also not an easy choice for Black as White now has 10 Nf6+, an irritating move that we will avoid, nevertheless.

**10.h3**

As mentioned, there is 10.Nf6+ , but after 10...Kf8 11.Ne4 Bg4 or even h6 Black seems to be OK. After our simple move, 10 h3, the game will very likely look at lot like the main line 9...Ne6, as ...Ne6-d4 is on Black's agenda anyway.

**10...O-O 11.d3 Ne6 12.a4**

With very similar play to the main line.

### (329) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...Nf6 6.e5**

**6...Nd5 7.Nc3 Nc7 8.Bxc6 dxc6 9.Ne4**

**9...Ne6**

**10.d3 O-O 11.Be3 b6 12.Qd2**

White aims for the Bishop trade. We will try to make Black's life uncomfortable on the kingside while allowing very little on the queenside. This position type does not look like a lot for White, but the score is very good as it is much simpler to handle, for White. Black is mostly just sitting there without a clear active plan.

**12...f5**

The e5-pawn is cramping, so Black immediately gets rid of it.

**13.exf6 exf6 14.Bh6**

White is slightly better here. We are quicker on the e-file and Black has some weaknesses, like the kingside and d6.

**14...a5**

This is the most popular move, allowing Ra7 in the future.

**15.Bxg7 Kxg7 16.Ng3 Ra7 17.Re2 Nd4 18.Nxd4 cxd4 19.Rae1**

And White is more comfortable.

### (330) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...Nf6 6.e5**

**6...Nd5 7.Nc3 Nc7 8.Bxc6 dxc6 9.Ne4**

**9...Ne6**

**10.d3 O-O 11.Be3 b6 12.Qd2**

**12...Re8**

Black prepares to keep his Bishop pair.

**13.Bh6 Bh8 14.Neg5 Nd4 15.Nxd4 cxd4 16.Re2**

This looks like a better version of the main line. Black is under some pressure as Qf4-h4 is a simple plan.

### (331) 4. Sicilian Rossolimo 1.e4 c5 - 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 Sicilian Ros 

**1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...g6**

**4.O-O**

**4...Bg7 5.Re1**

**5...Nf6 6.e5**

**6...Nd5 7.Nc3 Nc7 8.Bxc6 dxc6 9.Ne4**

**9...Ne6**

**10.d3 O-O 11.Be3 b6 12.Qd2**

**12...Nd4**

**13.Nxd4 cxd4 14.Bh6 c5**

Black sometimes starts with Qd5 instead, but ...c5 will be played soon anyway, so it's not a big difference.

**15.Qf4 Bb7 16.h4**

The main point of White's play is that the pawn on e5 allows this kingside initiative, and if Black wants to solve this completely he will very likely have to play ...f6 at some point. This has to be well prepared, though, as White might double on the e-file quicker. This does not amount to all that much, but White is simpler to play, here. This is also supported by the scores that favour White quite heavily. Note that Black has no active ideas at all, and this means White's position is very safe.
