### (4) Introduction - Vachier Lagrave,Maxime vs. Papaioann 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3**

Sensible development and also a line which may well spoil Black's fun, since many Scandinavian players are looking forward to wheeling out their favourite line, be that 3.Nc3 Qa5 or the trendy 3...Qd6 .

**3...Bg4**

Black's most aggressive choice and a pretty popular one too. In any event, our plan as White will be quite straightforward: prioritise kingside development then quickly, and surprisingly aggressively, hit back. If Black plays slowly that will be with d4 and c4, but in this critical line White may prefer to aim straight for the black king on the queenside.

**4.Be2 Nc6 5.O-O**

Completing the first stage of development. You can also look on White's modest-looking set-up as having lured the typically solid Scandinavian player into a more aggressive set-up than they would normally deploy.

**5...O-O-O**

5...Nf6 should also be met by 6.h3 Bxf3 7.Bxf3 Qd7 8.Re1 . As in our main game this is a pretty decent square for the rook, restricting Black's possibilities and play may even transpose, as it does in the event of 8...O-O-O 9.c3 e5!? .

**6.h3**

Continuing the kingside-first theme and a useful little prod too. Black is now likely to either cede the bishop-pair or retreat to h5, which is the square his queen would ideally have liked to have gone to.

**6...Bxf3**

6...Bh5 is the main continuation, as we'll see in Line E1 of our Scandinavian coverage. Here White has a few options and doesn't even need to push the central pawns just yet: 7.Nc3 Qd7 8.b4!? is quite a decent gambit, aiming straight for the black king.

**7.Bxf3 Qd7 8.c3**

A very useful preparatory move. White not only prepares d4, but also b4 and even facilitates Qa4.

**8...e5**

A major alternative is 8...Ne5 9.d4 Nxf3+ 10.Qxf3 , which we'll cover in some detail later on. White's bishop-pair has gone, but the queen is quite well placed on f3. White will bring his knight to c4 and may even then launch a queenside pawn storm.

**9.Re1**

Pressing against e5 and also helping to ensure that Black won't find it easy to get ...e4 in.

**9...Nf6 10.b4**

Our favourite advance when the black king is on the queenside and just quite a strong one here. White wants to force the knight to an inferior square with b5.10.Bxc6?! Qxc6 11.Rxe5 isn't impossible, but is a little materialistic. 11...Bd6 12.Re1 g5! leaves Black with the initiative and we want instead to be the side doing the attacking. Moreover, as you'll see in our detailed Scandinavian coverage, it's surprisingly rare how often Black is able to launch an attack - when White handles the opening correctly and doesn't go pawn-grabbing.

**10...Bd6**

Completing development is a somewhat wiser policy than 10...e4? 11.Bxe4 Nxe4 12.Rxe4 . White will be quick to go d4 and should here have sufficient control over the kingside, unlike in our last note: for example, 12...f5 13.Re1 g5 14.d4 . Now Bxg5 is a threat and even a timely Qh5 might prove annoying for Black. Meanwhile White most certainly hasn't forgotten about the queenside and a certain b5 advance: 14...g4 15.hxg4 fxg4 16.b5 Ne7 17.Nd2! sees White happy to return a pawn to open lines on the queenside. Black's attack isn't really getting anywhere and White's knight is all set to dominate the board from e4.

**11.d3**

Restrained play. This keeps control, although the more aggressive and committal 11.b5!? Na5 12.d4 could also be explored.

**11...Qf5**

White takes over surprisingly quickly after this. As such, Black probably had to try the slightly desperate-looking 11...e4! when White has a choice between: 12.Bxe4 Nxe4 13.Rxe4 , with similar play to our last note, and 12.dxe4 Qe6 13.Qe2 , dodging the check on h2 while retaining control.

### (26) Quickstarter - Scandinavian: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5**

simply must be the right way to counter the popular Scandinavian Defence. Our priority here is to deny Black his favourite lines, rapidly complete kingside development and then hit back in the center - with some force:

**2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4**

A critical counter. Instead, 3...e5?! 4.Nc3 doesn't really cut it for Black with the d4 break high on White's priority list, as we'll see at the start of Chapter Five, but 3...Nf6 is far from terrible. Here White can very much think kingside first: 4.Be2 Bg4 5.O-O . This leaves Black with a few different set-ups, but in every case White's plan is easy to remember: h3, to ask a question of the bishop, then d4 and probably c4 before Nc3, taking over the center and even quickly crashing through with d5 if Black is careless - see Line E2.

**4.Be2 Nc6 5.O-O**

Continuing to adhere to the kingside first policy.

**5...O-O-O**

Aggressive play from Black, but now White can either pick up the bishop-pair or force Black to take the h5-square away from his queen:

**6.h3 Bh5 7.Nc3**

Once Black goes long, White shouldn't be thinking d4 and c4, but rather attack! After driving the queen back, White is all set to open lines with a highly tempting gambit approach:

**7...Qd7 8.b4**

White very much has the black king in his sights and is happy to trade the b-pawn for an open line down to b7, as we'll see in some detail in Line E1. Black can decline, but may still come under direct pressure, as happened after

**8...Bxf3 9.Bxf3 Nd4 10.a4**

when Nb5 was already something of a threat in Decoster-Hopman, Belgian League 2017

### (27) Quickstarter - Scandinavian: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5**

**2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4**

**4.Be2 Nc6 5.O-O**

**5...O-O-O**

**6.h3 Bxf3 7.Bxf3 Qd7 8.c3**

is a very useful, multi-purpose advance. White may go d4, but he is actually more looking to attack after b4 and/or Qa4, as occurred in Vachier-Lagrave-Papaioannou, European Team Championship, Warsaw 2013

### (28) Quickstarter - Scandinavian: 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 N 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5**

**2...Nf6 3.Nf3 Nxd5**

prepares to meet 4.Be2 with 4...Nf4 , but White is hardly too inconvenienced having to advance in the center before housing the king:

**4.d4 Bg4 5.Be2 e6 6.O-O**

when h3 and c4 followed by Nc3 are high on the agenda and Black can easily find himself a little low on counterplay, as we'll see in Line E3.

### (289) Scandinavian Introduction - Introduction #1 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5**

Unsurprisingly there's nothing better than this natural capture and now we will focus our coverage on three main lines: - E1:2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 - E2:2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 - E3:2...Nf6 3.Nf3 Nxd5 and 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 Bg4 . The development of the king's knight rather than 3.Nc3 may not seem aggressive, but it is likely to prove mildly annoying to black players looking to trot out their favourite line, like the fashionable 2...Qxd5 3.Nc3 Qd6 We'll even follow up in the 2...Qxd5 lines with a rapid Be2 and O-O. That may not seem exactly aggressive, but once the king is safe White will quickly storm the center with d4 and c4 in many lines. Moreover, Black's critical line 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 sees him castling queenside, an approach which can lead to White launching a direct attack at quite an early stage.

**2...Qxd5**

Black's most popular move by a ratio of about two to one.

**3.Nf3**

Kingside development first is White's mantra and note that the great Scandinavian authority and Chessable legend John Bartholomew described 3.Nf3 as 'underrated'. Now Black almost always goes 3...Bg4 or 3...Nf6 , but we should also check whether he might expand in the center straight away.

**3...e5 4.Nc3**

Only now does White attack the queen so, since she must stay in touch with the pawn on e5. Retreating to d6 allows White to seize the initiative with 5.d4, so Black usually goes to a5 or e6.<addx start="5.d4"/>

**4...Qe6**

Dissuading d4.4...Qa5?! is a more typical Scandinavian square for the queen, but not one which disrupts White's development in the slightest here: 5.Bc4 . White is now ready to castle, then lay siege to the e5-pawn with Re1, with a rapid d4 or Ng5 two methods by which a powerful early initiative may be seized.

**5.Be2**

Modest development perhaps, but White does lead in development and is all set to go O-O and d4. Note too that 5...e4 would just cost Black a pawn and the initiative after 6.Ng5.

**5...Nf6 6.d4**

Blasting open the position to favour White's superior development.

**6...e4 7.Ng5**

Aggressive and strong: e4 and f7 can be targeted.

**7...Qf5 8.O-O**

Or the immediate 8.f3 . Having housed his king White will go f3 next and even has an immediate threat due to a neat tactic down the e-file:

**8...h6 9.Ngxe4 Nxe4 10.Nxe4 Qxe4 11.Re1**

The aforementioned tactic. Black is simply losing material in view of

**11...Kd8**

11...Qh4? 12.Bb5+ is mate next move.

**12.Bb5**

when the queen is skewered to the mate threat on e8.

### (290) Scandinavian Introduction - Introduction #2 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5**

**2...Qxd5**

**3.Nf3**

**3...Nc6**

can also be met by 4.Nc3 followed by Bb5 and/or d4, although here you may too prefer the outwardly more modest

**4.Be2**

when Black usually transposes to the main line of Line E1 with 4...Bg4. Instead, 4...Nf6 will be seen in Line E2 and neither is the central advance to be feared by White:

**4...e5 5.O-O**

Housing the king, refusing to fear ...e4 and intending to hit back with Nc3 and/or d4:

**5...Nf6 6.Nc3 Qa5 7.d4**

Only one king is safe here and it's not the one on e8. White may go d5, but his immediate threat is to take twice on e5 and go Re1, which all just leaves Black unable to equalize.

**7...exd4 8.Nxd4 Nxd4 9.Qxd4**

The structure may be symmetrical, but development will count. White threatens Nb5 and Bd2, as well as Re1, and even racing his king to safety won't see Black equalize: 9...Be7 10.Nb5 O-O 11.Bf4 Black must now drop a piece back to the first rank to defend c7, leaving White able to begin to expand on the queenside with c4 or even begin to eye the kingside after Bd3, with a definite edge.

### (291) Scandinavian Introduction - Introduction #3 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5**

**2...Qxd5**

**3.Nf3**

**3...Nc6**

**4.Be2**

**4...e5 5.O-O**

**5...Nf6 6.Nc3 Qa5 7.d4**

**7...e4 8.Ng5 Bf5 9.d5**

when Black can't castle due to the issue of f7 and

**9...Rd8 10.Bc4**

retains control while threatening both Nxf7 and Ncxe4.

### (292) Scandinavian Introduction - Introduction #4 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5**

**2...Qxd5**

**3.Nf3**

**3...Nc6**

**4.Be2**

**4...e5 5.O-O**

**5...Nf6 6.Nc3 Qd6 7.d4**

also seizes the initiative in view of a potential fork with Nb5 or

**7...e4 8.Nb5 Qd8 9.Ne5**

when White threatens to shatter Black's pawns and a knight exchange on e5 should but leave Black coming under pressure on c7.

### (293) Scandinavian Introduction - Introduction #5 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5**

**2...Qxd5**

**3.Nf3**

**3...Nc6**

**4.Be2**

**4...e5 5.O-O**

**5...e4 6.Nc3 Qf5 7.Nh4**

does place a knight on the rim, but is simply quite strong with e4 quite weak:

**7...Qf6 8.g3 g5 9.Ng2 Bf5 10.Ne3**

The knight fianchetto was brief. White now exerts pressure in the center, may even leap into d5 with a knight and can open lines to exploit his superior coordination with d3 or f3.

### (294) Scandinavian Introduction - Introduction #6 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5**

**2...Qxd5**

**3.Nf3**

**3...g6**

is a rare move, but one which has attracted a bit of grandmaster interest. White can either switch approach with 4.Nc3 Qd8 5.Bc4 followed by trying to strike against the black kingside or continue our usual policy of dominating the center with d4 and c4:

**4.d4 Bg7 5.Be2**

White has played d4 earlier than we do in most of the 2...Qxd5 lines, but that doesn't mean kingside development can't still be a sensible priority.

**5...Nf6 6.O-O O-O 7.c4**

With the king safe, White launches his ideal central expansion. Nc3 will follow with White's main early aim to keep Black a little cramped and devoid of a good pawn break:

**7...Qd6 8.Nc3 Bg4**

Before White has the chance to go h3.

**9.Be3**

Whi@e is now set to go Qb3 (and Qa3 if then ...Qb6) and Rfd1, maintaining full control, and Black doesn't seem to be able to undermine d4 effectively:

**9...Nc6 10.d5**

Already White is all set to quickly take over the board with Nb5 or c5 if allowed.

**10...Bxf3 11.Bxf3 Ne5 12.Be2**

Black's counterplay remains under control and f4 Ned7; Nb5 is now a threat, hence: 12...c6! 13.dxc6! the simplest method of maintaining control, as White's light-square presence continues to leave him with a very pleasant edge: 13...Qxc6 14.Qb3 . If left alone White will likely go Rfd1, h3 and maybe Nd5, with the other knight leap also quite possible, not least in the event of 14...Rac8?! 15.Nb5!

### (295) Scandinavian Introduction - Introduction #7 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5**

**2...Qxd5**

**3.Nf3**

**3...g6**

**4.d4 Bg7 5.Be2**

**5...Nf6 6.O-O O-O 7.c4**

**7...Qd8 8.Nc3 Bg4**

aims for counterplay against d4, but is just a little compliant. White is rarely unhappy to pick up the bishop-pair and will be able to maintain his center.

**9.h3 Bxf3 10.Bxf3 Nc6 11.Be3 Ne8**

This forced White into either exchanging on c6 or advancing in Matlakov-Artemiev, Moscow 2017, but

**12.d5 Ne5 13.c5**

left White with a handy space advantage and both Rc1 and Re1 on their way.

### (296) Scandinavian Introduction - Introduction #8 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5**

**2...Qxd5**

**3.Nf3**

**3...g6**

**4.d4 Bg7 5.Be2**

**5...Nh6**

is a more creative try and prepares counterplay against d4. As such, White may do well to hold back on c4 in favour of quick development:

**6.Bf4**

Removing d6 from the black queen's options.

**6...Nf5 7.Nc3**

Now we get to see one reason for not hurrying with castling: if Black retreats to d8 there's no reason White can't go 8.Qd2 and O-O-O.<addx start="8.Qd2"/>

**7...Qa5**

might still be met by 8.Qd2!? , but castling followed by attacking c7 should leave White with a pleasant edge.

**8.O-O O-O 9.Nb5 Na6 10.c3**

This useful move bolsters d4, threatens to seize space with b4 and a4, and White's knight will now be able to drop back and round to a fine post on c4, leaving him controlling the center, not least the e5 point.

### (297) Scandinavian Introduction - Introduction #9 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5**

**2...Qxd5**

**3.Nf3**

**3...g6**

**4.d4 Bg7 5.Be2**

**5...Nh6**

**6.Bf4**

**6...Nf5 7.Nc3**

**7...Qa5**

**8.O-O c6**

prevents Nb5, but

**9.Bc4 O-O 10.Ne4**

sti@l leaves White pleasantly better: c3 will follow and most likely Rfe1, Qd2 and Rad1 (playing in the center and ideally on the kingside too), while Black has to solve the problem of his light-squared bishop.

### (298) Scandinavian Introduction - Introduction #10 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5**

**2...c6**

is occasionally seen at club level, offering a pawn to accelerate Black's development. However, any development lead will not exactly be that large:

**3.dxc6 Nxc6 4.Nf3**

White threatens to strike back in the center and has ideas not just of d4, but Bb5 too:

**4...e5**

Threatening ...e4.

**5.Bb5**

White ignores the threat, being happy to see Black advance: 5...e4?! 6.Qe2 may even see White going two pawns to the good for little compensation with d3 next up or 6...Qe7 7.Nd4 exploiting the pin, while still leaving White with the d3 break. 5...Bd6 6.O-O As we'll do in the main lines of the Scandinavian, White first makes his king safe. He will now strike back with d4 or even develop simply with Bxc6, d3 and Nbd2, maintaining control of the position and leaving Black with little for the pawn.

### (299) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #1 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4**

Black's most active and critical choice.

**4.Be2**

Breaking the pin and also side-stepping any checks on the e-file. White prioritises kingside development before striking back in the center and fighting for the initiative.

**4...Nc6**

Continuing to develop aggressively while fighting for control of d4 and facilitating ...O-O-O. Instead, 4...Nf6 will be seen by transposition in Line E2 and the alternatives are somewhat unimpressive for Black.

**5.O-O**

Continuing to prioritize kingside development while keeping the d- and b-pawns flexible. Instead, 5.d4 O-O-O 6.Be3 followed by c4 is the sharp main line your opponent is likely ready for.

**5...O-O-O**

Critical as Black continues to make all the aggressive moves.

**6.h3**

White puts the question straight away to the black bishop.

**6...Bh5**

This must be critical, retaining the bishop and the tension.

**7.Nc3**

Putting the question after all to the black queen which has usually scurried back to d7 to avoid being attacked with tempo.

**7...Qd7**

7...Qd6 can be met in various ways, including 8.Nb5!? followed by d4 and/or a4, and 8.Ne4 . White now gains the option of a timely Ng3 or even Neg5. Once again, c3 and then d4 (or even b4 or Qa4) is on the agenda, while 8...Qg6 9.d3 keeps everything in place and carries a certain threat: g4!.

**8.b4**

Offering the b-pawn in any case and this move is likely to shock a Scandinavian player, especially if allowing 3.Nc3 Qa5 4.b4 isn't in their repertoire. White may also exploit the decision to hold back the d-pawn with 8.d3 followed by Be3 and then maybe a3 and b4, with definite chances to be slightly better.<level start="3.Nc3"/>

**8...Nf6**

Black's most popular and probably best choice in the limited practice there's been with this gambit (20 or so games), as well as recommended on the popular course 'John Bartholomew's Scandinavian Defense'. 8...f6?! 9.b5 simply ploughs straight ahead. White will follow up with a4-a5 or exploit the knight on the rim: 9...Na5?! 10.d3 . This was Pucovski-Plenkovic, Bosnjaci 2005, where far from solidly close lines, Black had merely helped White who immediately set about exploiting the knight's position with Qe1 and Bd2.

**9.d3**

A n@w idea. White is determined to sacrifice the b-pawn after all. Practice has also seen 9.a3 and 9.Rb1!? and the reason for avoiding the commonly-played: 9.b5 Bxf3 10.Bxf3 Nd4 (the only line considered by John Bartholomew) 11.d3 is not 11...e6 , but rather 11...Qf5! when Black just seems to have a decent game.

**9...Nxb4 10.Rb1**

The rook steps on to its favourite file.

**10...Nc6 11.Be3**

White eyes a7 and makes room for the queen on c1, while also intending to seize space in the center with d4 if allowed. Note too that an exchange on f3 is no longer going to be an issue as ...Bxf3; Bxf3 would but increase the pressure against the black king.

**11...e5**

Fighting for central space and challenging White to demonstrate his compensation.

**12.Qc1**

Continuing with the slow but attractive plan.

**12...Bd6**

The most natural spot for the bishop. In any case White enjoys decent compensation. 12...Be7? is just rather slow: 13.Qb2 b6 14.Nb5! . Already White is set to bludgeon his way through, with the immediate threat that of Nxe5 Nxe5; Nxa7+! followed by Bxb6.12...Bb4 can be met with 13.Qb2, 13.Ne4!? or just 13.Nxe5 Nxe5 14.Rxb4 Bxe2 15.Nxe2 Nd5 16.Rb3 . White has regained his pawn and retains some queenside pressure, with Qa3 next up.

**13.Nb5**

White doesn't just hunt down the bishop-pair, but brings more weight to bear against a7 and threatens c4-c5. Instead, Black now appears to be solid enough following 13.Qb2 b6 14.Nb5 Nd5! .

**13...a6 14.Nxd6+ Qxd6 15.c4**

The position could really do with a test or two, but White clearly has enough for his pawn with the immediate threat that of Qb2 and c5.

### (300) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #2 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4**

**4.Be2**

**4...Nc6**

**5.O-O**

**5...O-O-O**

**6.h3**

**6...Bh5**

**7.Nc3**

**7...Qd7**

**8.b4**

**8...Nf6**

**9.d3**

**9...Nxb4 10.Rb1**

**10...e6**

aims to keep the knight in place, but White always has a3 and should probably complete development first:

**11.Be3 Bd6 12.Qc1**

White simply swings the queen across and into the attack. It may emerge on b2 or even a3.

**12...e5 13.Qa3 Nc6 14.Qa4**

when the threat of Bxa7 isn't so too easy for Black to stop, as 14...Kb8? 15.Nb5 b6 16.c4! is far too strong an attack, with the immediate threat c5 Be7; Nxe5!. 14...Nd4! 15.Qxa7 Nxe2+ 16.Nxe2 Qc6 improves, although even in this messy position we'd prefer to take White: 17.c4 Bxf3 18.gxf3 and all of d4, c5 and Nc3 are potential issues for Black, as shown by 18...Qxf3? 19.c5 Be7 20.d4! when the attack should be a winning one with the d-file set to open.

### (301) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #3 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4**

**4.Be2**

**4...Nc6**

**5.O-O**

**5...O-O-O**

**6.h3**

**6...Bh5**

**7.Nc3**

**7...Qd7**

**8.b4**

**8...Nf6**

**9.d3**

**9...Bxf3 10.Bxf3 Nd4**

might be the choice of a well-prepared opponent who knew up to 8...Nf6, but Black's approach isn't so good when White can develop his queen's bishop:

**11.Be3**

White already sets his sights on a7 and once again doesn't mind replacing the bishop with the queen on f3:

**11...e5 12.Rb1**

White keeps everything secure and is now all set to charge ahead with a4. His attack appears the stronger, in part because he is far from all in and may still play in the center too, such as with Re1 or Ne4: for example,

**12...Rg8 13.Re1 g5 14.Bxd4**

Removing Black's best piece and increasing further White's light-square grip. 14...exd4, 14...Qxd4 15.Ne4 is also excellent for White due to his light-square control followed by c3! and Qb3, c4 or just 15...Nxe4 16.Bxe4 and Qf3 15.Ne4 Nd5 or 15...Nxe4 16.dxe4 with control of the kingside and e5 next up. 16.Nc5! Bxc5 17.bxc5 . This prevents Black from invading on c3 and even closing the key diagonal doesn't especially help him: 17...c6! 18.Bxd5! Qxd5 19.Re7 Rd7 20.Qe1 . The pressure against b7 is quite awkward for Black and White simply enjoys a strong initiative, with the immediate threat that of Re5 Qxa2; Ra1 and Rxa7.<skip/>

### (302) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #4 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4**

**4.Be2**

**4...Nc6**

**5.O-O**

**5...O-O-O**

**6.h3**

**6...Bh5**

**7.Nc3**

**7...Qd7**

**8.b4**

**8...Nf6**

**9.d3**

**9...e5**

waits for 10.b5 to go 10...Bxf3! 11.Bxf3 Nd4 , but White doesn't have to rush:

**10.a3**

This keeps b5 in reserve and so threatens Nxe5 while also simply intending Be3:

**10...Bd6 11.Be3 Kb8**

White has a few options here, including 12.Rb1 and 12.Nd2 , heading for c4, but he can also keep all his options open while making a useful move:

**12.Re1**

Black can copy, but not easily equalize:

**12...Rhe8 13.Ne4**

The knight heads for c5 or just g3 and White also welcomes a transformation of the structure:

**13...Nxe4 14.dxe4**

White is set to take control with c3 followed by Qc2 and Rad1 and only then c3-c4:

**14...Qe7 15.Qb1**

sees White all set to charge ahead with c4-c5 or c3 and a4 and there's no need to fear Black's only scary-looking move:

**15...Nd4 16.Nxd4 exd4 17.Bxd4**

Fearless play, but White is a pawn ahead and Black lacks a good discovery with his bishop on d6, while 17...Qxe4! 18.Bxa7+! Kxa7 19.Bxh5 doesn't give him enough for a pawn. White isn't getting mated as he always has g3 and if Black is too optimistic, only he will come under an attack: 19...Qf4?!, 19...Qc4 20.Qb3 restricts White to an edge and in an endgame where he should aim to retain a pair of rooks. 20.g3 Qh6?! 21.Rxe8! Rxe8 22.Qd1 g6 23.Bf3 Qxh3 24.c4 . Only one king is in serious trouble here and it isn't White's, with both Qa4+ and Qd5 serious threats.<level start="19...Qc4"/>

**6.h3**

**6...Bh5**

**7.Nc3**

**7...Qd7**

**8.b4**

**8...Nxb4**

is far too greedy and White has an even stronger reply than 9.Rb1

**9.Ne5 Bxe2 10.Qxe2 Qe6 11.Rb1**

It may sound a bold claim, but we believe that White is already winning here, which is quite a result:

**11...Nc6 12.Qb5**

12...Qxe5

12...Nxe5 13.Qxb7+ Kd7 14.d4 is unsurprisingly also a winner, with Black's kingside asleep: for example, 14...Ng6 15.d5 Qd6 16.Qb5+ Kc8 17.Ba3! Dragging the black queen to a somewhat sub-optimal location. 17...Qxa3 18.Qb7+ Kd7 19.Qc6+ Kc8 20.Rb7 Qd6 and now White can complete a neat sarcophagus mate: 21.Rfb1! Qxc6 22.dxc6 and Rb8#.<level/>

13.Qxb7+ Kd7 14.d4!? or just 14.Rb5, 14...Nxd4 15.Be3 Talk about a ginormous attack. Black can plug the d-file, but not save the game: 15...Nf5 16.Rfd1+ Nd6 17.Nb5 and Black collapses on c7 or after 17...Rc8 18.Nxa7 and Qc6+.<level start="14.Rb5"/>

### (304) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #6

**9.Ne5 Bxe2 10.Qxe2 Qe6 11.Rb1**

**11...f6 12.Rxb4 Qxe5**

avoids being cleaned up by Qb5, but still leaves b7 rather tender:

**13.Qf3 c6 14.d4**

White's attack is surely just too strong with Ra4 and/or d5 on their way.

### (305) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #7

**8.b4**

**8...Nxb4**

**9.Ne5 Qd4 10.Bxh5 Qxe5**

may improve, but still looks pretty horrendous for Black:

**11.Re1**

Whi@e will simply follow up with Bf3 (or even Bxf7) and Rb1.

### (306) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #8

**5...O-O-O**

**6.h3**

**6...Bh5**

**7.Nc3**

**7...Qd7**

**8.b4**

**8...e5**

is a creative counter-gambit, and not one to fear:

**9.Nxe5**

Exploiting the loose bishop on h5.

**9...Nxe5 10.Bxh5 Bxb4**

Black threatens to take on c3, but White can do even better than 11.Ne4 thanks to a simple and small queen improvement:

**11.Qe2 Re8**

defend the knight in Belenkaya-Nemcova, Stary Smokovec 2018, but now White might have boldly placed another piece on the e-file:

**12.Ne4**

White is now set to go c3 and d4 followed by improving the queen or just Rb1: for example,

**12...Nf6 13.Nxf6 gxf6 14.Rb1**

Black lacks even a half-decent discovery with the knight and once the bishop retreats White has at least the option of Qb5, forcing an endgame with the bishop-pair and somewhat superior structure.

### (307) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #9

**6.h3**

**6...Bh5**

**7.Nc3**

**7...Qd7**

**8.b4**

**8...Bxf3 9.Bxf3 Nd4 10.a4**

sees White unfussed by potentially losing the bishop-pair, since the queen will be equally good on f3. Now Nb5 is a threat, as is the good old pawnstorm with b5, a5 and b6:

**10...e6 11.a5**

11...Ne7 12.a6!? This isn't White's only tempting path, but it is quite strong and will still leave him with definite attacking chances: 12...b6 13.Bb7+ Kb8 14.Ne4 The knight may even land on g5 or even c5 once White has expanded with c3 and d4. Black's king position is quite simply a long-term cause for concern. White simply ploughs ahead, threatening light-square ruin with a6 or just b5.11.Nb5 Nxf3+ 12.Qxf3 c6! wasn't so clear in Kovchan-Hasangatin, Palma de Mallorca 2015.

### (308) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #10

**6.h3**

**6...Bh5**

**7.Nc3**

**7...Qd7**

**8.b4**

**8...Bxf3 9.Bxf3 e5**

is also possible when Stockfish even wants to go 10.a4!?, which speaks volumes about White's attacking chances, and

**10.Re1**

is also decent, followed by b5, as in Libiszewski-Lodici, Forni di Sopra 2014, where

**10...Bd6 11.Nb5**

seized a strong initiative in view of 11...Bxb4? 12.Bxc6! bxc6 13.Nxa7+ Kb7 14.Rb1 with a huge, surely decisive attack.

### (309) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #11

**6.h3**

**6...Bh5**

**7.Nc3**

**7...Qd7**

**8.b4**

**8...e6 9.b5**

is more of the same, strong forwards plan for White:

**9...Bxf3 10.Bxf3 Nd4 11.a4**

White essentially enjoys a free attack with a5 and b6 on the way: 11...Bb4 12.a5! Bxc3 13.dxc3 Nxf3+ 14.Qxf3 Qd5 15.Qxf7! Perhaps not the most obvious move, but simply very strong and superior to the 15.Qe3 Qxb5! 16.Qxa7 Qa6 of Hague-Ang, Auckland 2016.15...Nf6 16.b6! White is already winning: Black dare not open the a-file, but cannot deal with both the mate on c7 and bxa7 as 16...Qc5 17.Be3 simply overloads the queen.<level start="15.Qe3"/>

### (310) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #12 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4**

**4.Be2**

**4...Nc6**

**5.O-O**

**5...O-O-O**

**6.h3**

**6...Bh5**

**7.Nc3**

**7...Qa5**

is a rather strange location for the queen. White is better after the simple 8.d3 followed by Be3, a3 and b4 and the gambit option is also tempting:

**8.b4 Nxb4**

8...Qxb4? 9.Rb1 isn't at all prudent for Black, who must avoid blundering material to Rb5.9...Qd6 is a safe square, but after 10.d4 White enjoys a very strong initiative with d5 one threat, that of Nb5 followed by Ne5 another.

**9.Rb1**

White threatens a3 followed by Rb5 and enjoys pretty promising play:

**9...Nf6 10.d4**

White is now set to increase the pressure with Ne5 and you have to quite like his compensation: for example,

**10...Bg6**

10...e6?! 11.Ne5! Bxe2? 12.Qxe2 merely leaves Black in big trouble on f7

**11.Rb2**

Bd2 and Ne5 are now definite moves of concern for Black.

**11...Nc6 12.Nb5**

White again threatens c4 followed by Bd2 and even nudging the queen forwards isn't a panacea for Black:

**12...Qa4 13.Bd2**

White continues to toy with the black queen. One threat is Nc3 followed by Qb1 and Black's position remains extremely difficult to navigate: 13...Ne4!, 13...e6 14.Nc3 Qa3 15.Qb1! forces a serious weakness: 15...b6 16.Rb3 Qe7 17.Nb5. Now Rc3 is one strong possibility, that of a4-a5 another. 14.Bf4! e5! This seems to be the only decent, active defense, but the complications still favour White: 15.Nxe5 Nxd4 16.c3! Nxe2+ or 16...Qxd1 17.Nxa7+ Kb8 18.Bxd1 with threats on c6 and d4.<level start="13...e6"/><level start="15...b6"/>

**7.Nc3**

**7...Qa5**

**8.b4 Nxb4**

**9.Rb1**

**9...Nf6 10.d4**

**10...Nc6**

doesn't have to lead to complications after 11.Rb5 Qxc3 12.Bb2 . Rather White might just attack:

**11.Nb5**

The plan is c4 followed by Bd2 and

**11...a6 12.Bd2 Qxa2 13.Nc3**

is just very dangerous for Black with Ne4-c5 next up or

**13...Qe6 14.Be3**

when Black is terribly tangled up and White might just go Qc1-b2 or Na4-c5.

### (312) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #14 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4**

**4.Be2**

**4...Nc6**

**5.O-O**

**5...O-O-O**

**6.h3**

**6...Bxf3 7.Bxf3**

should once again be quite pleasant for White who will keep Black out of d4 with c3:

**7...Qd7 8.c3**

Black must now decide whether to regain a bishop or place a pawn instead on e5:

**8...Ne5**

Hitting the bishop and d3, and so pretty much forcing White to expand.

**9.d4 Nxf3+ 10.Qxf3**

White has lost the bishop-pair, but still enjoys a very pleasant edge. Black can deal with the threat to f7 easily enough, but his king is slightly the more vulnerable and Nd2/Na3-c4 quite awkward for him. From c4 the white knight will both threaten a timely leap into e5 and assist a queenside pawn advance: 10...Nf6 11.Nd2 Qd5 12.Qe2 It makes sense to retain the queens and now we'll see that the white knight will also be quite happy on f3, protecting the king while still controlling the e5 point: 12...e6 13.Nf3 Bd6, 13...Qe4 can be met by 14.Qd1 and Ne5 or just 14.Be3 followed by c4 or Ne5 and f3. 14.Re1 A useful move, keeping Black out of e4 and continuing to dominate e5. 14.c4 is also quite strong. 14...Qh5 15.c4 . Only now that everything was in place did White begin to expand in Short-Salov, Dos Hermanas 1997. He already threatens to cause serious disruption with c5 and c6, and enjoys control of the position: 15...c6 16.Qe3 Preparing Ne5.16.b4!? Bxb4 17.Bd2 looks like a decent gambit alternative. 16...Nd7 17.Bd2 left Short all set to race ahead with b4, c5 and b5.<level start="13...Qe4"/><level start="14.Qd1"/><level start="14.Be3"/><level start="14.c4"/>

**5...O-O-O**

**6.h3**

**6...Bxf3 7.Bxf3**

**7...Qd7 8.c3**

**8...e5 9.Re1**

applies some central pressure and also reinforces White's control of e4 ahead of any queenside expansion. Now 9...Nf6 10.b4 is a position we've already seen in the 5...Nf6 note and especially, of course, back in Vachier-Lagrave-Papaioannou. The alternatives look even worse for Black, though:

**9...Nge7 10.b4 Ng6 11.Na3**

is quite a clever move and even stronger than 11.d3. White recognizes that the knight may well be useful on c4: 11...f5 12.b5 Na5, 12...Nce7 13.d3! is only clearly better for White, unless Black falls for 13...Qxd3? 14.Qa4 Kb8, 14...e4 15.Bg5! is another neat point: 15...exf3 16.Rad1 Qxc3 and here the simplest method is a forcing one: 17.Rxd8+ Kxd8 18.Rd1+ followed by Qxa7 or 18...Ke8 19.b6+! c6 20.bxa7 to generate a second queen 15.Be3 with the twin threats of Qxa7+ and Rad1.13.Qa4 b6 14.Nc4 . Already Black's cause is a hopeless one due to his badly exposed king. Taking on c4 allows mate in two and even closing the long diagonal walks into a shot: 14...e4 15.Nxa5 bxa5 16.Rxe4! fxe4 17.Bg4 skewering the queen.<level start="11.d3"/>

**4.Be2**

**4...Nc6**

**5.O-O**

**5...O-O-O**

**6.h3**

**6...Bf5**

creates a slightly strange impression, but makes it hard for White to play in the center with his pawns. As such, the black queen should be kicked followed by preparation for d4:

**7.Nc3 Qd6 8.Nb5**

A brave leap - and a handy resource. White wants to get d4 in and is happy to sacrifice:

**8...Qd7 9.d4**

Already Bf4 is threatened, so Black would surely prod the knight:

**9...a6 10.a4**

Boom! Remarkably so strong are White's queenside prospects that even 10.Be3 is quite strong. 10...axb5? 11.axb5 Nb8 12.Ra8 White doesn't have an immediate threat per se, but Black is bound hand and foot and simply cannot defend. Simply c4, Qa4 and Qa7 is an issue, as is Ne5 and even just Bf4 followed by Qa1 or b6.10...e5! is probably Black's best try, countering in the center while preventing Bf4:11.Be3 White would now be delighted to see 11...axb5? 12.axb5 Nb8 13.Nxe5 , is ready to unpin with Qe1 and maintains the upper hand even after the central exchanges: 11...exd4 12.Nbxd4 The more complex 12.Bf4!? is also promising. 12...Nxd4 13.Nxd4 Not only might White pocket the bishop-pair, but he is all set to expand with Re1 and Bf3 or even c3 and b4.<level start="10.Be3"/><level start="12.Bf4"/>

### (316) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #18 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4**

**4.Be2**

**4...Nc6**

**5.O-O**

**5...O-O-O**

**6.h3**

**6...h5**

has only been played twice, but is the sort of move that looks scary and might put some players off 6.h3. Note, though, that the move doesn't carry a threat - just don't take the bishop and open the h-file! White has always responded with 7.Nc3 , but we prefer to place a different unit on that square:<level start="6.h3"/>

**7.c3**

White prepares to advance with d4 or even b4 and there's something not quite right about Black's obvious central counter:

**7...e5 8.hxg4**

This is possible, and critical of course, now that Black can't immediately swing the queen to h5:

**8...hxg4 9.Ng5**

A key advance and not 9.Nh2 f5? . White now threatens Bxg4+ and Bh3, as well as Qb3, and Black doesn't seem to have enough for the piece:

**9...Nh6**

Black prepares to meet 10.Qb3 with 10...Qd6 .

**10.Bxg4+ Nxg4 11.Qxg4+ Kb8 12.d4**

White is happy to return a pawn to catch up in development and surely Black doesn't have enough for a piece with White always able to block the h-file with a timely Nh3 or return the extra material to take control. Moreover, Qf3 to target f7 is a threat: 12...f6! 13.Ne6! Bravely going where many a knight has gone before and somewhat more convincing than 13.Nh3 g5. 13...Re8 14.Nxf8 Rexf8 Thanks to the open h-file and White's sleepy queenside pieces, the situation isn't completely clear and 15.Nd2 f5! 16.Qg5 Rf6 is one line to avoid. Thankfully White has a strong semi-prophylactic advance available 15.f4!.<level start="13.Nh3"/>

is the alternative when materialists may well be happy with 9.Nd4 Nxd4 10.cxd4 hxg4 11.Nc3 Qe6 12.d3 , but White can also return the piece for a simple life and clear advantage:

**9.g5 exf3 10.Bxf3 Qxg5 11.d4**

The bishop on f3 is now something of a monster and White is all set to take over the initiative with Nd2 to prevent ...Ne5 being annoying and b4. There's also no need to fear being forced into g3:11...Qh4 12.Nd2 Bd6 13.g3 There just isn't a great square for the black queen and a second sacrifice would definitely be one too many: 13...Bxg3?, 13...Qe7 14.Re1 Qd7 is the alternative when the fearless silicon sees nothing wrong with swiping the h-pawn, but you may well prefer the calmer alternative: 15.Nc4 h4 16.g4 . This keeps lines closed, White's king safe and will be followed by b4-b5. 14.fxg3 Qxg3+ 15.Bg2 and there just isn't a good follow-up with Qf3 and/or Ne4 on their way.<level start="13...Qe7"/><level start="15.Nc4"/>

### (318) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #20 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4**

**4.Be2**

**4...Nc6**

**5.O-O**

**5...Nf6**

has, once again, also been seen and here White is quite well placed to kick the bishop then expand in the center:

**6.h3 Bh5 7.d4**

White is now set to crash through in the center with c4 and d5, so Black must react:

**7...e6 8.c3**

This is in keeping with our restraining approach when Black has knight on c6.8.c4 Qd7 9.Be3 followed by Nbd2 must also be a pleasant edge for White.

**8...Be7 9.Re1 O-O-O 10.Nbd2**

White improves the knight, facilitating a timely Nf1, before expanding on the queenside. He is now all set to go b4 and need not fear a similar strike on the other flank: 10...g5!? Here the engines rather like 11.g4!? and if 11...Bg6 12.Bc4 , seizing the initiative, and it's also quite possible to ignore Black 11.b4 g4 12.hxg4 Nxg4, 12...Bxg4 13.b5 is another important motif followed by Ne5: 13...Na5 14.Ne5! Bxe2 15.Qxe2 . White's pressure against f7 is not so easy for Black to deal with and White is simply a lot better here with Ndf3 and c4 on their way. 13.Nf1! An important retreat and resource. Thanks to the possibility of a timely Ng3 White really shouldn't get mated and it's his own queenside and central play which is the key feature of the position:<level start="12...Bxg4"/><level start="13...Na5"/>

### (319) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #21

**5...Nf6**

**6.h3 Bh5 7.d4**

**7...e6 8.c3**

**8...Be7 9.Re1 O-O 10.Nbd2**

is @ safer choice for Black, but here he is still unpleasantly worse, lacking a good pawn break. White meanwhile will improve his knight with Nf1 (or Nc4 if there's no ...Bxf3 issue) and Ne3, and can also consider expansion with a4 and b4 or sometimes even g4

**10...Rad8 11.a4 Rfe8 12.b4 Qf5 13.Nf1**

This important move keeps the king quite safe and also causes issues for the black queen. Note too how 13...Ne4 14.Ng3! Nxg3 15.fxg3 would only improve White's kingside and help him to take over the initiative with g4 and/or Bf4.

**4.Be2**

**4...Nc6**

**5.O-O**

**5...Nf6**

**6.h3 Bxf3 7.Bxf3 Qd7 8.Re1**

is a pleasant two-bishop edge for White. He is all set to make use of the strong bishop on f3 by going d4 and

**8...O-O-O**

can be met by either 9.d3 Nd4 10.Nd2 , maintaining a pull due to White's control of e5 after Nc4 or even

**9.c3 e5 10.b4**

White ignores development to take advantage of the strong light-squared bishop and Black's king position. Already b5 and Rxe5 is a threat, with b5 followed by d4 also high on White's agenda or just simple development with d3 and Na3/Nd2-c4. We've already seen how Black was quickly blown in Vachier-Lagrave-Papaioannou, European Team Championship, Warsaw 2013.

### (321) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #23

**4.Be2**

**4...Nc6**

**5.O-O**

**5...e5**

is once again tactically flawed:

**6.Nc3**

Now we saw that 6...Qa5 7.Re1 is pretty strong in our coverage of 4...e5? and in any case e5 is highly vulnerable:

**6...Qd7 7.Nxe5**

Much stronger than 7.Re1?! O-O-O .

**7...Nxe5 8.d4**

White will either emerge a pawn to the good following dxe5 and any exchanges on d1 or with a huge initiative: 8...Bxe2 9.Qxe2 Qxd4? 10.Rd1 The key move. Black's queen now can't stay in touch with the knight and his cause should really be hopeless with such a king position: for example, 10...Qc4 or 10...Qc5 11.Rd5 . 11.Qxe5+ Ne7 12.Nb5 when something is going to have to give.

**4.Be2**

**4...Nc6**

**5.O-O**

**5...e5**

**6.Nc3**

**6...Qd6**

can be well met by 7.d4 or just

**7.Re1**

eyeing the critical point:

**7...O-O-O 8.Nxe5 Bxe2 9.Qxe2**

and there goes a clear pawn, since there's no time for 9...Re8 with f7 hanging.

### (323) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #25 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4**

**4.Be2**

**4...Bxf3 5.Bxf3**

followed by a check is not something White should fear, with the light-squared bishop already quite an asset:

**5...Qe5+ 6.Be2**

6.Qe2 and 6.Kf1!? are also quite tempting.

**6...c5**

Black clamps down on d4, which makes good positional sense, although White cannot be too unhappy with his bishop en route for a fine post on f3:

**7.O-O Nc6 8.Nc3**

Whi@e simply wants to take control with Bf3, d3 and Re1, which he may well combine with a queenside advance: 8...e6 9.Bf3 Nge7 10.d3 This left White with an edge in Robson-Narciso Dublan, Internet (blitz) 2019. Re1 will follow and possibly then Nb5 and a4 (Nb5-a3-c4 is rarely a bad manoeuvre for the knight), while Black was slightly low on counterplay and again not advised to castle long: 10...O-O-O ?! 11.Re1 Qc7 12.Nb5! 12...Qb6 13.a4 Model play from Ray Robson, intending Bf4, as well as Na3-c4 and then a5-a6, which left Black's position beginning to creak. 8...O-O-O ?! asks too much of Black's position: 9.Re1 Qc7 10.d3 Steady and thematic play thus far from White, but now he is ready to go Nb5 and a4 or if 10...a6 11.Be3 Nd4 12.Na4! The immediate c3 is a threat and White may also go Bxd4 Rxd4; c3 followed by powerfully ripping open lines with d4 or b4.

### (324) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #26 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4**

**4.Be2**

**4...Bxf3 5.Bxf3**

**5...Qe6+**

can be met by 6.Kf1!? , 6.Qe2 Qxe2+ 7.Kxe2 c6 8.d4 followed by Bf4, Nd2 and a queenside advance with a very pleasant two-bishop edge, or just the other block:

**6.Be2 Nc6 7.c3**

An important move, keeping Black out of d4 and the bishop-pair intact. Next White will castle, then begin to expand:

**7...Qg6 8.O-O e5**

Now 9.d4 O-O-O 10.Bh5 followed by d5 is pretty decent, indeed, for White and it's also possible to expand on the queenside:

**9.b4**

White simply wants to seize the initiative with b5 and d4.9...O-O-O was a brave response in Kadric-Bogut, Tuzla 2019, where 10.Qa4 might have been met by 10...e4 , but there was no need for White to abandon the plan: 10.b5! Na5 11.Qa4 b6 12.d4! pinpoints the problems with Black's set-up, not only threatening dxe5, but intending Bd2 in the event of a pawn exchange on d4. Black also has to factor in Nd2-c4/b3 and is vulnerable on the light squares, for example: 12...Bd6 13.Nd2 exd4 14.cxd4 Nf6 15.Nc4 when Black's queenside is under quite some pressure, with Bf3 on the way, as well as Nxa5 and 15...Nxc4 16.Qxc4 simply intending to throw the a-pawn down the board - with some effect.

### (325) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #27 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4**

**4.Be2**

**4...e5**

is also not to be feared, since White's king is safe and he will hit back with Nc3 and d4:

**5.Nc3 Qa5 6.O-O**

Threatening Nxe5.

**6...Nc6**

6...Bxf3?! 7.Bxf3 c6 8.d4 blew open lines before Black was ready in Van Leeuwen-Dunwoody, correspondence 2003.

**7.Re1**

This may be even stronger than 7.Nxe5 Bxe2 8.Nxc6 Bxd1 9.Nxa5 Bxc2 10.Nxb7 . White reinforced the threat of Nxe5 and there just doesn't seem to be a good move for Black

**7...O-O-O 8.Nxe5 Bxe2 9.Qxe2**

White is just a clear pawn to the good, since Black cannot pin

**9...Re8 10.Qg4+**

It's already game over with Nxc6 or Nxf7 set to wreak absolute havoc.

### (326) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #28 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4**

**4...e5**

**5.Nc3 Qa5 6.O-O**

**6...Nc6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Bxf3 8.Bxf3 Nge7**

tries to keep everything solid, but here White can expand on the queenside to seize a strong initiative, including with the immediate

**9.b4 \***

### (327) Scandinavian E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E1: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4 #29 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Bg4**

**4.Be2**

**4...e5**

**5.Nc3 Qd6 6.d4 Bxf3 7.Bxf3**

also leaves Black in trouble. He can block on the long diagonal, but not also prevent White from opening the position to favour his bishops

**7...Nc6 8.dxe5 Qxe5+ 9.Be3**

Clearly Black can't castle and White has two strong ideas: O-O followed by Re1 and Bxc6+ bxc6; Qd4, taking control of the position.

### (328) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #1 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6**

Natural development from Black and by far his main approach along with the 3...Bg4 of Line E1.

**4.Be2**

Outwardly modest development, but an appealing choice. White holds back on d4 to first get his king to safety, hoping that a delayed d4 will carry more force, such as if it counterattacks against a black pawn on e5. The pawn may even land up on d3, while options are very much kept open too on the c-file: all of Nc3, c4 and c3 may be seen depending on what set-up Black opts for.

**4...Bg4**

This no longer pins, of course, but has been Black's most popular choice. 4...c6 5.O-O is very likely to transpose to our ...Bf5 approach, such as with 5...Bf5 6.d4 e6 7.c4 and we're back in the main line there.

**5.O-O**

Sticking to our general policy of: kingside first. Here White can also consider 5.h3!? Bxf3 6.Bxf3 following by meeting a check with offering a queen exchange and relying on the bishop-pair.

**5...e6**

Black's most common move, taking a step towards castling short.

**6.h3**

Our favourite bishop challenging plan and useful move to flick in with tempo ahead of central expansion.

**6...Bh5 7.d4 c6**

Black's most solid move and a typical Scandinavian one, giving him a firm hold on d5.

**8.c4**

White continues to wheel out all the natural and strong moves.

**8...Qd8**

Black has most often retreated to base camp so. Going to d7 doesn't make much sense with the knight still on b8, but d6 isn't a ridiculous alternative.

**9.Nc3**

Straightforward development. With the pawn on c6, not c7, 9.Qb3 would now be met by 9...Qb6 , although here the space-loving engines still rather like White after 10.c5!? . After 9.Nc3 transpositions are rife, but White will continue with Bf4 and then may consider g4 ideas, with a3 followed by b4 an arguably even stronger advance.

**9...Nbd7 10.Bf4 Be7**

Here White a couple of grandmasters have prepared to expand with 11.a3 , but due to Black's move order, White actually has an even stronger advance than b4 to play for:

**11.d5**

Immediately! The advance turns out to be rather strong, with d6 threatened and if Black hoovers absolutely everything on d5, both b7 and the bishop on h5 will hang.

**11...cxd5**

11...exd5 12.cxd5 Bc5 was preferred in Kupreichik-Medancic, Opatija 2013, where 13.dxc6 bxc6 14.Nd4 was by no means the only good move, but caused serious issues for Black's king and structure.

**12.cxd5 exd5**

12...Bxf3!? 13.Bxf3 Qb6 is the extremely desperate-looking suggestion from the engines, but here White can go 14.d6 or just 14.dxe6 fxe6 15.Re1 followed by targeting e6.

**13.Nxd5**

Talk about a dream outcome from the opening for White. Now if Black castles he will lose the exchange to a trade on e7 followed by Bd6.

**13...Nxd5 14.Qxd5 Bxf3 15.Bxf3 Nc5**

This left Black clinging on to b7 for now in V. Volovich-Tskhadadze, St. Petersburg 2018, where

**16.Qc4**

followed by Rad1, Rfe1 and Bd5 simply left White dominating the board and with a huge advantage.

### (329) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #2

**6.h3**

**6...Bh5 7.d4 c6**

**8.c4**

**8...Qd8**

**9.Nc3**

**9...Be7 10.Bf4**

would transpose if Black now went 10...Nbd7 and White can continue in the same fashion if Black prefers to castle:

**10...O-O 11.a3 a5 12.Re1**

White continues to find useful moves and this one is somewhat stronger than 12.Qb3?! Bxf3! 13.Bxf3 Qxd4 .

**12...Re8**

Thi@ was Korneev-Tiviakov, Khanty-Mansiysk (blitz) 2005, where, thwarted on the queenside, White might have turned his attention to the alternative expansion.

**13.g4 Bg6 14.Qb3 Qc8 15.Ne5**

Once again, Black's passive set-up does not overly impress with Nxg6 and Rad1 likely to follow, after which White will look for a powerful d5 breakthrough, and also has ideas of h4-h5.

### (330) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #3

**8.c4**

**8...Qd8**

**9.Nc3**

**9...Be7 10.Bf4**

**10...O-O 11.a3 Bd6**

angles for an exchange, but White should want to exchange on his terms. 12.Bg5 is sensible, as is a knight leap:

**12.Ne5 Bxe2 13.Qxe2**

Due to the potentially loose bishop on d6, Black cannot race his knight out to d7 and in any case remains rather passive while White goes Rad1 and Rfe1, possibly followed by d5 or even Rd3, looking to attack.

### (331) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #4

**5.O-O**

**5...e6**

**6.h3**

**6...Bh5 7.d4 c6**

**8.c4**

**8...Qd6**

facilitates 9.Qb3 Qb4 and also prevents Bf4, but White should not mind deploying the bishop to e3 instead:

**9.Nc3 Be7 10.Be3 Nbd7**

Here 11.Qb3 Qb4 12.Qc2 followed by a3 and b4 is fairly tempting, as is another square for the queen to tee up Bf4 after all

**11.Qd2**

White threatens Bf4 and then a3 and b4 or even d5, and, as such, Black's position is not as solid as it may appear: 11...Qc7 12.d5!? A preparatory 12.Rfd1 might be even stronger. 12...exd5, 12...Bxf3 13.Bxf3 Ne5 tries to keep lines closed, but doesn't equalize in view of 14.Qe2 14.Be2 exd5 15.cxd5 followed by exchanging on c6 and relying on the bishop-pair or 15...Rd8 16.Qd4 swapping d5 for a7. <level start="12.Rfd1"/>

### (332) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #5

**5...e6**

**6.h3**

**6...Bh5 7.d4 c6**

**8.c4**

**8...Qa5 9.Nc3 Nbd7 10.Bf4**

was@more of the standard approach from White in Stevic-Egerc, Zupanja 2010 (here 10.d5!? might also be explored), when Qb3 was on the way and note that there's rarely any need to fear an earlier ...Bb4 from Black in such positions:

**10...Bb4 11.Qb3 O-O 12.a3**

12...Bxc3 13.bxc3 left the Croatian Grandmaster with a pleasant edge. White enjoys the bishop-pair and it isn't so easy for Black to deal with the pressure against b7 in view of 13...b6 14.Qb4! when a4-a5 will follow if Black ducks the exchange.

### (333) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #6

**4.Be2**

**4...Bg4**

**5.O-O**

**5...e6**

**6.h3**

**6...Bh5 7.d4 Nc6**

is more aggressive, but probably weaker. White now has quite a pleasant choice with 8.c3!? one option, followed by Nbd2-c4 or b4 should Black castle long. Our standard central expansion is the alternative:

**8.c4 Qd7 9.Be3**

This is usually played after Nc3, but here developing the bishop first gives White some useful extra options. One is 9...Rd8 10.Nbd2 which keeps d4 secure, the other is seen if Black prefers to castle:

**9...O-O-O 10.Qb3**

10.Nbd2 and Nb3 is quite promising too. 10...h6 White tactically prevents the possibility of 10...Bxf3 11.Bxf3 Nxd4 , while gearing up for Rd1 and d5. 11.Rd1 Everything is now set for d5 with Black unable to take the pawn due to the resulting pin and Nc3 11...g5? lashed out in Degraeve-Dia, Saint Affrique 2008, where White went 12.d5 and even stronger would have been 12.Ne5! followed by the power-packed advance g4.<level start="10.Nbd2"/><level start="10...Bxf3"/>

**6.h3**

**6...Bh5 7.d4 Nc6**

**8.c4 Qd7 9.Be3**

**9...Rd8**

was advocated in 'Smerdon's Scandinavian'. Here Radeva's 10.Nbd2!? Be7 11.a3 a5 12.Qb3 should give White an edge and the queen's knight can still go the other way

**10.Nc3 Be7 11.Qb3**

This allows Black to exploit his pressure against d4, but White may still retain a slight edge:

**11...Bxf3 12.Bxf3 Nxd4 13.Qxb7**

The queen covers back to f3, Rad1 is threatened or even just Bxd4, and Black's queenside is a little loose: 13...c5 was seen in Tryggestad-Bolstad, Bergen 2018, where White should have fought for the initiative and challenged Black's best piece: 14.Nb5!? Now the a-pawn is a target and White should be able to emerge with an edge: 14...Qxb7 15.Bxb7 Rb8 16.Nxd4! Rxb7 17.Nc6 . White's knight continues to annoy Black and his mini-initiative and queenside majority should count for a small edge. Currently c5 is attacked and 17...Rc7 18.Na5!? followed by a3, Rab1 and b4 would begin to roll the majority.

### (335) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #8

**8.c4 Qd7 9.Be3**

**10.Nc3 Be7 11.Qb3**

**11...Na5**

lines up a disruptive ...Bxf3, but after

**12.Qb5 Qxb5 13.cxb5**

White must be somewhat for choice, with Black's knight sidelined to the rim and Rac1 on the way, as well as g4 and Ne5.

### (336) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #9

**5.O-O**

**5...e6**

**6.h3**

**6...Bh5 7.d4 Nc6**

**8.c4 Qd8 9.Nc3 Be7**

creates a slightly strange impression with the knight on c6. Now White might consider the aggressive 10.g4!? Bg6 11.d5 or simply

**10.Be3 O-O 11.Re1**

This is almost always a good spot for the rook. Now Black will do well to get in ...e5 and is just quite cramped, while White might well consider expanding with a3 and b4.

### (337) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #10

**4.Be2**

**4...Bg4**

**5.O-O**

**5...e6**

**6.h3**

**6...Bh5 7.d4 Be7**

may look like an improvement on 7...c6, but little c-pawn push is actually quite useful for Black, especially if White after our standard c4 is able to quickly arrange an assault on b7:

**8.c4 Qd8**

8...Qd6 may be a better square, enabling Black to meet 9.Qb3 with 9...Qb6 or even 9...Nc6!?. Here 9.c5!? is by no means ridiculous to cramp Black and White can also simply develop: 9.Nc3 c6 and play has transposed to a position we'll see via a 7...c6 move order.

**9.Qb3**

Forcing Black to either weaken the light squares or move his queen yet again. Meanwhile White will be quick to mobilize with Nc3 and then Bf4 and/or Rfd1

**9...Qc8 10.Nc3 O-O 11.Rd1**

White hints at a timely d5 advance and keeps his queen's bishop's options open. With Black a little passive it may also be possible to hunt down the bishop-pair with g4 and Nh4: 11...Nbd7 12.g4!? A more ambitious approach than the still rather pleasant for White 12.Be3 of Kaidanov-Dzindzichashvili, U.S. Championship, Parsippany 1996. 12...Bg6 13.Nh4 This route now that the black knight covers e5. As Black's bishop cannot escape to e4 (14.g5!), White enjoys a pleasant edge, with Nxg6 followed by Bf4 and Bf3 on the way and he will most probably meet any slightly desperate ...c5 break with d5.11...c6 12.g4 Bg6 13.Ne5! would be similar and here Black should not tarry or White will force further concessions with h4.11...h6 makes a bolt-hole for the bishop, but at the cost of a tempo and 12.Bf4 leaves White with ideas of Nb5 and d5 to seize the initiative: 12...c6 13.d5! exd5 14.cxd5 is just very awkward for Black as 14...cxd5 15.Nxd5 Nxd5 16.Rxd5 Bg6 17.Ne5 leaves White with a near-decisive initiative, with Rc1 and/or Bg4 on their way to cause a major headache for the black queen.<level start="12.Be3"/><addx start="14.g5"/>

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6**

**4.Be2**

**4...Bg4**

**5.O-O**

**5...c6**

is @nother possible move order and very likely to transpose into our main line (5...e6). White should again kick the bishop then expand in the centre with d4 and c4:

**6.h3 Bh5 7.d4 e6 8.c4**

and play has transposed to our main line with 5...e6.

**5...c6**

**6.h3**

Black usually retains the bishop-pair.

**6...Bxf3 7.Bxf3 Qd6 8.d4**

is quite pleasant for White followed by c4 and Nc3. Here another good set-up was revealed by Maxime Vachier-Lagrave:

**8...e6 9.Na3 Be7 10.Nc4 Qd8 11.Bf4**

Whi@e's bishop on f3 makes it difficult for Black to get ...c5 and he never managed to break free in Vachier Lagrave-Neiksans, Warsaw (blitz) 2010:11...O-O 12.c3 Nbd7 13.a4! Nb6 14.Ne5 Nbd7 15.Nd3! which kept pieces on and so left Black rather cramped.

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6**

**4.Be2**

**4...Bg4**

**5.O-O**

**5...Nc6**

is Black's second most common move, but the formula of a prod followed by d4 doesn't change for White:

**6.h3**

Described as 'a slightly annoying sequence' by leading Scandinavian authority, the Australian GM David Smerdon.

**6...Bh5 7.d4**

Model deployment of our favourite system so far from White and in part because Black has spent a tempo on ...Nf6, White can still go c4 even if Black elects to go long:

**7...O-O-O 8.c4**

White may follow up d5 or simply complete development with Be3 and Nc3, depending on where the queen goes: 8...Qf5 9.Be3 simply intends Nc3 and d5 or Qa4, while side-stepping 9.d5? e6. 9...e5? 10.d5 e4? saw Black attempt to blast his way out of trouble in Grandelius-Vihmand, Puhajarve (rapid) 2017, but simply lost material. Can you spot how White wins a piece? 11.Nh4 Bxe2, 11...Qe5 12.Bxh5 Nxh5 13.Qg4+, 12.Qxe2 1-0 and that was already that with Black's queen and knight both hanging.<level start="9.d5"/><level start="11...Qe5"/>

**4.Be2**

**4...Bg4**

**5.O-O**

**5...Nc6**

**6.h3**

**6...Bxf3 7.Bxf3**

is once again just rather compliant from Black:

**7...Qd7**

Now 8.d4 O-O-O! would begin counterplay, but White can inhibit ...e5 with his rook and even avoid d4:

**8.Re1 O-O-O**

Here 9.d3 followed by Nbd2-c4 would be one sensible plan and we're also drawn to more aggressive ideas:

**9.c3 e5 10.Qa4**

White already has a threat, although he must be a little careful in the center with the queenside pieces still at home:

**10...Bd6 11.d3**

Thi@ prevents Black seizing the initiative with ...e4 (11.b4? e4! is actually quite nasty), while simply intending Be3 and Nbd2-c4, not to mention b4-b5.

### (342) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #15 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6**

**4.Be2**

**4...Nc6 5.O-O**

usually leads to our main line after 5...Bg4.

**5...e5 6.Nc3**

is the alternative when White has every chance of seizing a strong, early initiative with both d4 and Re1 high on the agenda:

**6...Qd6**

can be strongly met by 7.Bb5 followed by Qe2 or Re1, or the immediate central break:

**7.d4**

White threatens both Nb5 and to exchange twice on e5 then go Re1, and Black just doesn't have a great move:

**7...e4**

Trying to keep lines closed.

**8.Nb5 Qd8 9.Ne5**

This powerful leap confirms that White has seized the initiative. An exchange of knights would now leave Black rather vulnerable on c7 and in any case Bf4 is on the way, as is c4:9...a6 10.Nxc6 bxc6 11.Nc3 sees the knight driven backwards, but White can hardly complain about the outcome, having shredded Black's queenside pawns. Bg5 will follow and Black may well struggle to cope with a rapid f3 to activate White's light-squared bishop. 9...Nxe5? 10.dxe5 is already just winning as Black as the knight can't go to d5 without being removed and even d7 isn't that great a a square: 10...Nd7 11.e6! fxe6 12.Bf4 e5 Black stays afloat for now, but is about to be hit by a powerful sacrifice: 13.Bg5! There just isn't a good defense with Black having to either drop the rook in the corner or displace his king and in a position where Qd5 is on its way. 9...Bd6 allows White various promising options of which temporarily retreating the knight might be the strongest: 10.Nc4 O-O 11.Ncxd6! cxd6 12.Bf4 Ne8 13.c4 Black has avoided disaster on c7 and d6, but is clearly worse. White enjoys the two bishops and will be quick to open the position with f3.

### (343) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #16 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6**

**4...Nc6 5.O-O**

**5...e5 6.Nc3**

**6...Qd6**

**7.d4**

**7...exd4 8.Nb5 Qd8 9.Bf4**

is even stronger than regaining the pawn immediately. Black must either allow his structure to be compromised on d6 or move his knight again:

**9...Nd5 10.Bg3**

White now threatens Bc4 and will still enjoy a powerful initiative even after recapturing on d4 assuming the b5-knight is prodded.

### (344) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #17 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6**

**5...e5 6.Nc3**

**6...Qd6**

**7.d4**

**7...Nxd4 8.Nxd4 exd4 9.Nb5**

sees White regaining his pawn with interest after Bf4 Nd5; Qxd4 or

**9...Qb6 10.Bf4**

Again, there's an even better move than immediately taking on d4 and, again, Black must make a concession on d6 or fall further behind in development:

**10...Nd5 11.Be5**

and the threat of c4 is a strong one, as is just that of Bxd4 c5; Nc3.

### (345) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #18 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6**

**4.Be2**

**4...Nc6 5.O-O**

**5...e5 6.Nc3**

**6...Qa5**

is also well met by

**7.d4 e4 8.Ng5**

threatening the e-pawn, Bc4 and d5.

### (346) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #19 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6**

**4.Be2**

**4...e5 5.O-O**

is likely to transpose to 4...Nc6 5.O-O e5 after 5...Nc6 here. In any case White is set to go d4 and need not fear Black pushing on:<level start="4...Nc6"/>

**5...e4 6.Re1**

is unplayed, but appears just as strong as 6.Nc3 Qa5 7.Nd4 . Clearly capturing on f3 would cost Black his queen and both Nc3 and d3 are issues for him.

**6...Be7**

sensibly closes the e-file, but doesn't prevent White from seizing the initiative:

**7.Nc3 Qd6**

7...Qa5 can be met by 8.b4!? or simply 8.Nd4 when the knight will drop back to b3 if needed and meanwhile d3 is on the way.

**8.Ng5 Bf5 9.d3**

Naturally White strives to open lines and assist his knight on g5, and he also has a little intermezzo in store: 9...exd3 10.Nb5! Qd8 11.Bxd3 Bxd3 12.Qxd3 Taking stock we can see that Black would come under heavy pressure down the e-file and on c7 if he now traded queens and in any case he shouldn't be quite equal: 12...O-O 13.Qb3 A fine square for the queen, pressing on b7 and f7. The knights will drop back to c3 and f3 if attacked and meanwhile Bf4 and Rad1 are on their way, leaving White with a pleasant if slight initiative.

### (347) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #20 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6**

**4.Be2**

**4...Bf5**

is Black's main alternative to 4...Bg4. Yet again White should simply castle:

**5.O-O**

White is now most likely to place his pawns on d4 and c4, which should secure a pleasant space advantage, and he can also consider an early Nh4:

**5...e6**

Black continues with his solid and typical Scandinavian light-square system of development. Note that 5...c6 6.d4 is extremely likely to transpose after 6...e6 .

**6.d4 c6 7.c4**

7.Nh4 and even 7.Nbd2 followed by Nc4 and c3 also lead to an edge if you prefer. The text attacks the black queen and is the most powerful set-up at White's disposal. Nc3 will follow and look out too for a timely Qb3:

**7...Qd8 8.Nc3 Be7**

This is, of course, quite a solid set-up for Black, but he isn't equal. With the bishop on e7, 9.d5? followed by Nd4 no longer leads anywhere, but 9.Qb3 is a possibility and if 9...Qb6 10.c5! Qxb3 11.axb3 followed by b4-b5 with a small but definite edge. Possibly even more promising, though, is to chase down the bishop-pair:

**9.Nh4 Bg6 10.Be3**

10...O-O 11.Nxg6 hxg6 12.Qb3 The pressure against b7 isn't so easy for Black to counter, as ...b6 would badly weaken him on the h1-a8 diagonal: 12...Qc8

12...Qb6 13.Qc2 completes a fairly common feint, slightly misplacing Black's queen. He can avoid d5, but not equalise: 13...Qc7 14.Rac1 Nbd7 15.Rfd1 White enjoys a harmonious set-up and one where it's not so easy for Black to break out. He must always be on his guard for d5 and White may be able to gradually expand with a3, b4 and Bf3.<level/>

13.Rfd1 Nbd7 14.Rac1 This lined up the rooks in a powerful manner -avoiding the more blocked e-file- in Vujosevic-Zhukova, Nis 1997, where White was quick to blast open lines with d5:14...Rd8?! 15.d5! Nc5

15...exd5 16.cxd5 Bc5 was the grim alternative: 17.dxc6 bxc6 18.Bf4 followed by Bf3 with a strong bishop-pair and pressure for White. 16.Qa3! A strong square for the queen, as Black lacks a discovery, leaving her knight in trouble and also b4 on the way.

10...Nbd7 was preferred in Zvjaginsev-Monell Camarasa, Mallorca Olympiad 2004, where White might already have opened the position: 11.Nxg6 hxg6 12.d5! Now dxe6 is a structural threat and Black isn't going to be able to hunker down with a typically solid Scandinavian bunker style approach: 12...exd5 13.cxd5 cxd5 14.Nxd5 Black has avoided being saddled with an isolated c-pawn, but is far from equality. White is set to pick up the second bishop on e7 and will enjoy pressure down the h1-a8 diagonal, be that from a queen on b3 or even d5 or bishop on f3. This is actually a rare point of the repertoire where you have a choice 10.Bf4 O-O 11.Nxg6 hxg6 12.Bf3 is a pleasant edge as we saw after 6...Be7. The bishop is also decently placed on e3, leaving the queen free to roam to b3.

### (348) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #21 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6**

**4...Bf5**

**5.O-O**

**5...e6**

**6.d4 c6 7.c4**

**7...Qd8 8.Nc3 Be7**

**9.Nh4**

Black normally retreats so, preparing to erect a solid pawn barrier on the kingside.

**9...Be4 10.Nxe4 Nxe4 11.Nf3**

is just a pleasant edge for White, who may continue with Bf4, Bd3, Qe2, Rad1 and Rfe1 ahead of gradually building up for a kingside attack, perhaps beginning with Ne5.

### (349) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #22 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6**

**4.Be2**

**4...Bf5**

**5.O-O**

**5...e6**

**6.d4 c6 7.c4**

The queen doesn't have to go back to base camp, but otherwise can become a target:

**7...Qd6 8.Nc3**

Already White has ideas not just of Qb3, but of seizing the initiative with d5 followed by Nd4.

**8...Ne4 9.Qb3 Qb4**

saw Black trying to reduce the pressure through exchanges in Haldorsen-Omorjan, Novi Sad 2021, but here there is an even stronger advance than 10.d5:

**10.c5 Qxb3 11.axb3**

White enjoys pressure down the half-open a-file and has the simple and strong plan of b4-b5:

**11...Be7 12.b4 O-O 13.Ne5**

was even stronger than 13.b5 in the game. White threatens g4, prevents ...Nd7, facilitates Bf3 and will drop the knight back to a fine square on c4 if attacked.

### (350) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #23 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6**

**4.Be2**

**4...Bf5**

**5.O-O**

**5...e6**

**6.d4 c6 7.c4**

**7...Qa5 8.Nc3 Nbd7**

has@often been met by 9.a3 , but White doesn't have to rush with b4 and also need not fear ...Bb4 (there's always at least Bd2 and a3):

**9.Bf4 Be7**

and now 10.Qb3 Qb6 is quite solid for Black, so White might decide it's a good time to bag the two bishops:

**10.Nh4 Bg6 11.Nxg6 hxg6 12.Re1**

A fine post for the rook, helping to ensure that Black won't be able to break with ....e5. While Black is quite solidly placed, he is also a bit passive, with White set to expand with a3, b4, Bf3 and Qb3, retaining control and looking to get in a timely b5 or d5 advance.

### (351) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #24 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6**

**4.Be2**

**4...Bf5**

**5.O-O**

**5...e6**

**6.d4**

Black doesn't have to make all the Scandinavian pawn moves, but in any case White should be going c4 and Nc3.

**6...Be7**

actually allows White to consider 7.Ne5!?, as well as just follow the plan:

**7.c4 Qd8 8.Nc3**

This is quite a pleasant set-up, with Qb3 and Bf4 both on their way, and it's usually possible too to pick up the bishop-pair with Nh4 if you wish: for example,

**8...O-O 9.Bf4 c6 10.Nh4 Bg6 11.Nxg6 hxg6 12.Bf3**

took control of the position in Neiksans-Vijups, Riga 2018. Note Black's lack of counterplay, in part due to White's fine bishops. The Latvian Grandmaster continued with Qe2 and Rad1 and later showcased one of White's main attacking ideas: g3 followed by h4 and h5.

### (352) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #25 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6**

**4.Be2**

**4...Bf5**

**5.O-O**

**5...Nc6**

doesn't make so much sense when Black's bishop isn't on g4, helping him to battle for control of d4:

**6.d4**

threatens c4 and d5 and, in any case, the knight may well prove misplaced on c6:

**6...e6 7.c3**

There's also nothing wrong with 7.c4 Qd7 8.Qb3 if you prefer, but with the text White keeps c4 options in reserve, such as in the event of ..Bd6, and may also go b4 should Black bravely castle long.

**7...Be7 8.Bf4 Qd7 9.Nbd2**

White enjoys a pleasant edge thanks to his grip on e5. Nc4, Re1 and a4 may all follow, keeping Black a little bottled up.

### (353) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #26 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6**

**4.Be2**

**4...c5**

hopes to set up a Maroczy Bind after ...Nc6 and ...e5, but this is ambitious to say the least. Here is a good time to delay our normal 5.O-O in favour of kicking the queen back followed by opening the centre:

**5.Nc3 Qd8 6.d4**

White enjoys easy and active development with Be3 or Bf4 on the way and the option still to castle on either side: for example,

**6...cxd4 7.Nxd4 a6**

Prudently preventing any ideas of Ndb5, albeit at the cost of another tempo.

**8.Bf4 Nbd7 9.Bg3**

This fine prophylactic move not only prepares to meet ...e5 with Nf5, but also leaves Black struggling to free the queenside with the restrictive Bf3 and Nb3 on their way.

### (354) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #27 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6**

**4.Be2**

**4...g6**

exploits the fact that White isn't set up to go Bf4 and Qd2, Fischer style, but White once again obtains a pleasant game by housing the king and then advancing both centre pawns:

**5.O-O Bg7 6.d4 O-O 7.c4**

All as per the plan. Such positions also arise in the Alekhine and both the 2...Nf6 and 2...Qxd5 3.Nc3 Qd6 lines of the Scandinavian. Black's position is solid, but can become quite cramped if White makes it hard for him to break effectively with ...e5 or ...c5. The bishop on c8 can also become something of a problem piece, in contrast to which it's not hard for White to go Nc3 and then possibly Qb3 and Bf4, with h3 often pretty useful too:

**7...Qd6 8.Nc3 Bg4 9.h3**

White refuses to let the bishop settle and is happy to allow Black a smidgen of central pressure in return for the bishop-pair and a fine prelate on f3:

**9...Bxf3 10.Bxf3**

If Black plays slowly White will be quick to go Qb3 and Re1, but neither should active development be feared: 10...Nc6 11.Nb5! Qd7 12.Bf4 This is why the knight leapt forwards. White threatens both c7 and d5 and after the 12...Ne8 of Stevic-Nisipeanu, European Championship, Budva 2009, 13.d5! Ne5 14.Bxe5!? Bxe5 15.Qe2 would have been an unstereotyped and forcing route to a pleasant advantage, with a rapid c5 and disruptive Bg4 high on the agenda, possibly even above Rad1 and Rfe1.

### (355) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #28 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6**

**4.Be2**

**4...g6**

**5.O-O Bg7 6.d4 O-O 7.c4**

**7...Qd6 8.Nc3 c6 9.h3**

is a useful move, preventing ...Bg4, facilitating Be3 without any fear of ...Ng4, and even intending g4 should Black become careless:

**9...Bf5 10.Qb3 Qc7 11.Be3**

activated White's queen with tempo before completing development in Ruiz Marana-Alonso Rosell, Don Benito 2012. White was all set to centralize his rooks with Rfe1 and Rad1, keeping Black restricted and ideally even teeing up a powerful d5 advance. Here Black also needs to be a little careful with his queen's knight: 11...Nbd7? 12.g4! either traps Black's bishop mid-board with Nd2 or snares a piece with the pawns: 12...Be6 13.d5

### (356) Scandinavian E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf - E2: 2...Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6 #29 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nf3 Nf6**

**4.Be2**

**4...g6**

**5.O-O Bg7 6.d4 O-O 7.c4**

**7...Qd8 8.Nc3**

has also been seen when Black should really develop slowly. A more active approach just seems to lead to a good version of a Benoni-type position for White:

**8...c5 9.d5**

Taking is also quite tempting, but the text seizes some useful space and simply intends to complete development with Bf4, Qd2, Rfe1 and Rad1:

**9...e6 10.Bf4 exd5 11.cxd5 a6 12.a4**

left Delroy looking pretty powerful, Black low on counterplay and White all set to dominate the board after Rfe1, Qb3 and Rad1 in Burovic-Dumpor, Konjic 2021.

### (357) Scandinavian E3: 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 - E3: 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 Nxd5/Bg4 # 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6**

This has traditionally been about half as popular as the queen recapture and, at least in the UK, is probably seen somewhat less than that these days.

**3.Nf3**

We stick with a knight-first possibility, which is likely to annoy fans of 3.d4 Bg4 , the Portuguese variation, as was so well covered in David Smerdon's fascinating 'Smerdon's Scandinavian'.

**3...Nxd5**

3...Bg4 is still possible, but somewhat less sharp and practically dangerous than with d4 played instead of Nf3. Now 4.Bb5+ Nbd7 5.h3 is probably quite promising, but you can also simply go 4.Be2 when Black hasn't anything better than regaining the pawn: 4...Qxd5 was Dave Smerdon's choice, as we saw in Line E2, while 4...Nxd5 is the main line of this section.

**4.d4**

Breaking our kingside first policy from Lines E1 and E2, but a wise call to avoid 4.Be2 Nf4 . White can go Be2 next and then O-O and c4 if allowed.

**4...Bg4**

This pin is one of Black's two main moves.

**5.Be2**

Immediately breaking the pin. Decent cases can also be made for 5.c4 and Carlsen's 5.h3 .

**5...e6**

Developing the kingside. 5...Nc6 is outwardly more active when 6.O-O followed by c4 is likely to transpose to our main line after 6...e6 .

**6.O-O**

Simple chess as White sticks with the kingside-first policy before expanding with c4.

**6...Nc6**

Black's sharpest if not necessarily best option.

**7.h3**

Asking the question, although there's also nothing wrong with the immediate 7.c4 if you prefer.

**7...Bh5 8.c4**

Asking a second question and by a large majority 2...Nf6 Scandinavian players tend to retreat to b6, keeping f6 free for the king's bishop.

**8...Nb6 9.Nc3**

Aggressive and strong development, as White refuses to be intimidated by the pressure on c4 and fear the exchange on f3.

**9...Be7**

Ducking the challenge for now and possibly hoping to pressure d4, as well as c4.

**10.b3**

Simple and strong play, maintaining c4 while dangling d4 before Black. Fans of IQP set-ups may prefer 10.d5!? exd5 11.cxd5 which also seems to be quite good.

**10...Bxf3**

10...O-O is a better try, if still rather nice for White 11.Be3 , here rather than Bb2 to keep d4 secure. White will simply follow up with Qd2 and Rfd1 when d5 may follow. Other useful ideas to keep a look-out for are Ne5, possibly in conjunction with g4, and Ne4-c5.

**11.Bxf3 Nxd4 12.Bxb7**

Naturally White is happy to recoup the pawn.

**12...Rb8**

We've followed Motylev-Shishkov, European Rapid Championship, Tallinn 2019, where White made a good case for 13.Be3!? and it was also possible to keep the bishop-pair.

**13.Be4 O-O 14.Be3**

This feels like a rather pleasant edge for White. Rac1, Qd3 and Rfd1 may follow and there's no need to fear Black's attempt to maintain the knight on d4:

**14...c5 15.Bf4 Bd6 16.Bxd6 Qxd6 17.Nb5**

This is why. Now an exchange of knights would leave White with a very useful outside majority and 17...Qf4 18.Nxd4 cxd4 18...Qxe4 19.Nb5 leaves Black somewhat worse, as shown by 19...Rfd8 20.Qc1 a6 21.Nc3 when Qa3 may follow and note too how Black's knight just isn't on a particularly good square. 19.Re1 does too with the c-pawn particularly mobile and White also enjoying the superior minor piece.

**6...Nc6**

**7.h3**

**7...Bh5 8.c4**

**8...Nb6 9.Nc3**

**9...Bxf3 10.Bxf3**

is music to White's ears, since the c-pawn is really taboo:

**10...Nxc4 11.d5**

This is why: White blasts open lines in the centre and to exploit his light-square control. Not only is Re1 high on the agenda, but even Qb3 can prove awkward for Black: for example,

**11...N6e5 12.Be2**

Retaining the bishop and threatening Qa4+. 12.dxe6 is also pretty good, unsurprisingly.

**12...Nb6 13.Bf4**

White's initiative is simply a very strong one, with Bb5+ followed by an exchange on e6 next up.

when White might trade on c6 then go Qg4 or even

followed by Re1+ and/or Bf4.

also leaves Black in big trouble followed by Nb5 or even just Bf4.

jus@ creates a slightly strange impression, as we noticed by transposition (...Qd8xd5-d8 instead of ... Nf6xd5-f6) back in Line E2, where we saw that

**10.Be3 O-O 11.Re1**

should be quite pleasant for White.

### (362) Scandinavian E3: 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 - E3: 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 Nxd5/Bg4 #

**5...e6**

**6.O-O**

**6...Nc6**

**7.h3**

**7...Bxf3 8.Bxf3 Be7**

off@rs White a few decent set-ups. Even 9.c4 Nb6 (revealing Black's standard aim: pressure against d4) 10.d5 exd5 11.cxd5 Ne5 12.Be4 should be a bit better for White, 9.c3 followed by Nd2 and Nc4 or Ne4 is control and a very pleasant edge, and White can also aim for an improved version of the c4 and d5 approach by first deploying his rook

**9.Re1**

Now if Black goes ...Bf6, White will switch to a c3 and Nd2-e4 approach, but otherwise he has a more ambitious set-up in mind:

**9...O-O 10.c4 Nb6 11.d5**

The point: White opens the position for his bishop-pair, not least the fine bishop on f3. He would love to exchange on e6 and is also happy with a strong version of an IQP on d5:11...exd5 12.cxd5 Nb4 13.Nc3 Now a3 is a threat and White may also complete development with Bf4, Qd2 and Rad1. Black can challenge for central control, but not come anywhere near to equality: 13...c6 14.dxc6 Nxc6 15.Bf4 Qxd1 16.Raxd1 leaves White dominating with his fine bishop-pair. On top of the threat of Bxc6, he might leap forwards with Nd5 or slowly improve the pieces, perhaps beginning with g3 and Kg2.

**3...Nxd5**

**4.d4**

**4...Bg4**

**5.Be2**

**5...e6**

**6.O-O**

**6...Be7**

has actually been Black's most common choice when White can ask the question of the bishop before expanding:

**7.h3 Bh5 8.c4**

As per usual, Black's knight has a choice and we saw that 8...Nf6 is fairly well met by 9.Qb3 back in Line E2. That leaves

**8...Nb6 9.Nc3**

and a likely transposition to our main line after 9...Nc6

### (364) Scandinavian E3: 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 - E3: 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 Nxd5/Bg4 #

**5...e6**

**6.O-O**

**6...Be7**

**7.h3 Bxf3 8.Bxf3 c6 9.c4 Nb6 10.Qd3**

is a pleasant two bishop edge where White will follow up with Rd1, Nc3, Bf4 and ideally a power-packed d5 advance.

**3...Nxd5**

**4.d4**

**4...Bg4**

**5.Be2**

**5...e6**

**6.O-O**

**6...Bd6**

allows Black an extra option with his knight, but again not one that should be feared:

**7.h3 Bh5 8.c4 Nf4 9.Bxf4 Bxf4 10.Qb3**

Black has the bishop-pair, but that's the end of the good news for him, since both Qxb7 and Qb5+ are threatened, with 10...Nd7 11.Qxb7 Rb8 12.Qxa7 Rxb2 13.Nc3 followed by the consolidating Qa3 just a clear extra pawn for White.

### (366) Scandinavian E3: 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 - E3: 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 Nxd5/Bg4 # 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6**

**3.Nf3**

**3...Nxd5**

**4.d4**

**4...g6**

has been fractionally more popular, with Alekhine or arguably even Grünfeld-like play in mind. However, White's centre is secure and our favourite development scheme not under threat:

**5.Be2 Bg7 6.O-O O-O 7.c4**

Only with the kingside development solved does White expand and now Black tends to retreat to b6, pressing on c4 a little, we saw briefly in Line E2 that 7...Nf6 8.Nc3 is quite pleasant for White, with 8...c5?! 9.d5 most certainly to be welcomed

**7...Nb6 8.Nc3**

Straightforward development, but 8.h3!? Nc6 9.d5 can also be considered if you want to cut out ...Bg4.

**8...Bg4 9.h3**

A brave, but important move and one which actually secures White's centre. Instead, 9.Be3 Nc6 now supplies decent counterplay in view of 10.d5 Bxf3 11.Bxf3 Ne5 , although White might consider 9.c5 Nd5 10.Qb3 . After the text, Black's only logical choice is to exchange

**9...Bxf3 10.Bxf3**

Eyeing the rook in the corner. 10...Nc6

10...c6 11.c5! followed by Qb3 and/or Bg5 leaves Black under pressure too.<level/>

11.c5! A much stronger advance than 11.d5 Nd4 , as clearly Black now cannot go to d5 and he actually faces quite a big choice, and with White still very much able to go d5 at some point 11...Nd7?! 12.Be3!.<level start="11.d5"/>

Black can hit back in the centre, but not come close to equalizing: 12...e5?! 13.Bxc6 bxc6 14.d5! was an unstereotyped, but strong advance in Lutz-Casagrande, Biel 1996. White has threats with his d-pawn and will recapture with his queen on d5, after which Qc4 and b4 will leave him with a handy and mobile queenside majority. 11...Nc4 is a better try, but White can still advance, whether with 12.Be2 N4a5 13.d5 or immediately 12.d5 Nd4 Now going forwards may be even stronger than the standard bishop retreat: 13.Be4! White threatens to skewer with Qa4 and while Black can hit back in the centre, he shouldn't be able to equalize with his knights set to be driven backwards: 13...c6 14.dxc6 Nxc6 14...bxc6? 15.Qa4 followed by Rd1 only helps White somewhat. 15.Qe2 This drives the second knight backwards, after which White will be able to retain control and a sizeable advantage after Be3, Rfd1 and Rac1. Somewhat stronger than 12.d5 Nd4 , as White only now threatens d5, and if ...Ne5; Be2, as well as Qa4 and Rfd1.

### (367) Scandinavian E3: 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 - E3: 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 Nxd5/Bg4 # 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6**

**4.d4**

**4...g6**

**5.Be2 Bg7 6.O-O O-O 7.c4**

**7...Nb6 8.Nc3**

**8...Nc6**

hopes that ...Bg4 will now carry more sting, but before that move can land, White can make a strong central advance:

**9.d5 Ne5 10.c5**

Forcing the pace. If you prefer a simpler life, both 10.Qb3 and 10.Nxe5 Bxe5 11.Bh6 are also promising.

**10...Nbd7**

10...Nxf3+ 11.Bxf3 Nd7 12.Be3 is likely to transpose, as with 12...Ne5 13.Be2 c6 14.f4

10...Bxc3 11.cxb6! Even stronger than 11.bxc3 Nxd5 12.Bh6. 11...Bf6 12.Bf4 White threatens both to obtain a huge passed pawn and to win two minor pieces for the rook with b4. Black has only one real try to avoid such a fate, but the resulting largely forced line is still somewhat in White's favour: 12...c5 13.Bc7! . Discombobulating Black and more importantly maintaining a presence on b6.13...Qd7 14.Rc1 axb6 15.Bxb6 c4 16.b4! cxb3 17.axb3 Taking stock, we find Black's knight still sidelined, White dominating the board and Rc5 or Bc5 next up.<skip/>

**4.d4**

**4...g6**

**5.Be2 Bg7 6.O-O O-O 7.c4**

**7...Nb6 8.Nc3**

**8...c5**

can be well met by 9.dxc5!? or

**9.d5**

seizing space. White will follow up with Bg5, Qd2, Rad1 and Rfe1 and Black just has an inferior version of a Grünfeld

**9...e6 10.Bg5 Bf6 11.Qd2**

when White may well gain an attack, as shown by

**11...Bxg5 12.Nxg5 exd5 13.cxd5 Nc6 14.Rad1 Nd4 15.Nge4**

when the d-pawn is taboo due to Black's rather vulnerable dark squares, c5 is en prise and both Qf4 and Qh6 also high on the agenda.

### (369) Scandinavian E3: 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 - E3: 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 Nxd5/Bg4 #

**4.d4**

**4...g6**

**5.Be2 Bg7 6.O-O O-O 7.c4**

**7...Nb6 8.Nc3**

**8...c6**

is solid, but also slow. Here a decent case can be made for 9.h3 and White might also just go

**9.Be3 Bg4 10.Qb3**

when Rad1 will follow and the d-pawn is once again poisoned:

**10...Bxf3 11.Bxf3 Bxd4 12.Rad1 e5 13.c5**

Black's game is collapsing not so much down the d-file as the b-file.

### (370) Scandinavian E3: 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 - E3: 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 Nxd5/Bg4 # 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6**

**3.Nf3**

**3...Nxd5**

**4.d4**

The rare alternatives to 4...Bg4 and 4...g6 don't make a huge deal of sense. The only really logical one is

**4...Bf5**

when White can just continue as per normal:

**5.Be2 e6 6.O-O Be7 7.c4**

A s@arp choice (if you don't want to be so bold, begin instead with 7.a3), but it transpires there's no reason no to fear Black's knight heading forwards

**7...Nb4 8.Nc3**

The key follow-up, as White refuses to waste time on Na3 or Ne1. He is now ready to go a3 and if ...Nc2?; Ra2, so Black must head forwards without delay:

**8...Nc2 9.g4**

This bold space-gainer is a new idea, White having previously only sacrificed the exchange for sufficient compensation with 9.Rb1 Nb4 10.Be3 . Black's knight would now be trapped if it grabbed, but, of course, he's surely going to retain the bishop and threat

**9...Bg6 10.Rb1**

Now White is all set to untangle with Bf4 and Rc1 or even a rapid d5. 10...Nb4 11.Be3! Bxb1 12.Qxb1 Taking stock we find Black an exchange to the good, but like the engines, we would be pretty happy here as White. His lead in development and attacking chances should most certainly not be underestimated. White is already set to blast open the centre with d5 and might also increase the pressure with a3 N4c6 and Qe4: for example, 12...Nd7

12...O-O 13.a3 N4c6? 14.d5 wins the knight in view of 14...Na5 15.b4 13.Rd1!?<level/>

The more forcing 13.a3 Nc6 14.d5 should also supply promising compensation. 13...O-O 14.g5 White refuses to rush and now the simple plan is Qe4, a3, Bd3 and after ...g6, h4-h5. Meanwhile Black is cramped and low on counterplay, which must ensure that White has at least sufficient if not more than enough compensation.

**3...Nxd5**

**4.d4**

**4...Bf5**

**5.Be2 e6 6.O-O Be7 7.c4**

**7...Nf6 8.Nc3 c6**

transposes to a variation of Line E1, where we noted that White was doing fairly well after

**9.Nh4 \***

**3...Nxd5**

**4.d4**

**4...Bf5**

**5.Be2 e6 6.O-O Be7 7.c4**

**7...Nb6**

is a slightly strange square for the knight, if Alekhine-like, and after

**8.Nc3 O-O**

White can either go 9.Bf4 or copy Friso Nijboer with

**9.Be3 Nc6 10.h3**

with an edge; Qd2, Rfd1 and Rac1 will follow and ideally then d5.

### (373) Scandinavian E3: 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 - E3: 2...Nf6 3.Nf3 Nxd5/Bg4 # 

**1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6**

**3.Nf3**

**3...Nxd5**

**4.d4**

**4...Bf5**

**5.Be2 e6 6.O-O Bd6**

is more active, but should not put White off a key central advance:

**7.c4 Nf4 8.Bxf4 Bxf4**

Here White might go 9.Qb3 followed by Nc3 and looking for a quick d5, or simply deprive Black of the bishop-pair:

**9.Bd3 Bxd3 10.Qxd3**

which threatens Qe4 and also leaves White set to seize the initiative with Nc3 followed by d5.
