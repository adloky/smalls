## London System

**1.d4 Nf6 2.Bf4**

The London system has become very popular nowadays. At first, this system was a favorite among the players who just liked to get a 'game' and take opponents out of book. But with more and more games played regularly, especially by the World Champion Magnus Carlsen himself, the London has become quite popular and theoretically dense. It mostly comprises strategic elements and plans but there are also some lines that have a very concrete nature. I am recommending an easy-to-follow setup against the London system but there are some lines in which you need to study the concrete variations carefully.

**2...d5 3.e3**

This is undoubtedly the most flexible move order for White. He has to play e2-e3 at some point so it is better to play it immediately and later decides when to develop the g1-knight to f3. 3.Nf3 c5 4.e3 transposes to the mainline.

**3...c5 4.Nf3**

4.Nd2 cxd4 5.exd4 Qb6 hitting both the b2- and d4-pawns. 6.Nb3 The only move to save both pawns at the same time.

**4...Nc6 5.c3**

This is the wrong move order for White. Black can try to seize the initiative with...

**5...Qb6 6.Qc2**

Is a passive way of defending the b2-pawn. We can exploit it by harassing the f4-bishop.

**6...Nh5**

Going after the London bishop! We already have slightly more space in the centre because of our pawns on d5 and c5. If we also manage to gain the bishop pair, Black will surely be the one to be preferred.

6...Bf5 this typical trick, distracting the white queen from the support of the b2-pawn, is not so effective now because White has his own distracting move, 7.dxc5 With the black pawn already on c4, this move is not available to White.

**7.Be5**

7.Bg5 h6 8.Bh4 g5 9.Bg3 Nxg3 10.hxg3 Bg7⩱ we have successfully managed to gain the bishop pair.

**7...f6 8.dxc5 Qxc5 9.Bd4 Qa5↑**

And I believe Black has a nice initiative here. Our threat is to trap White's bishop in the centre with ...e5 and White has to find a satisfactory way to defend against this.

## Trompovsky

**1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 d5 3.Bxf6**

White should exchange on f6 sooner or later in the spirit of the Trompowsky, creating an unbalance by giving up the bishop pair but ruining Black's pawn structure.

3.Nc3 transposes to the Veresov,

3.Nf3 transposes to the Torre Attack,

3.e3 c5 should transpose to the mainline after 4.Bxf6 gxf6 which are all examined in the main course.

**3...gxf6 4.e3 c5 5.dxc5**

This is how White recently played against the 3...gxf6 variation. After this exchange White's main idea is to sooner or later go for the c4 break and open up the centre. After that White would like to create something on the kingside and try to exploit Black's weak pawn structure on the kingside.

As Black, we have the bishop pair and our main aim should be to try and exchange as many pieces as possible, especially the queens, as most of the endgames are favourable for us.

**5...e6 6.Nf3 Bxc5**

Now White again has the option of breaking with c2-c4 immediately or delaying it.

**7.c4 dxc4 8.Nbd2**

This has to be played in order to avoid the exchanges of queens, otherwise, the endgame does not promise anything for White.

**8...c3**

We are going to lose the c4-pawn anyway so it is better to lose it by ruining White's pawn structure.

**9.bxc3 O-O 10.Be2 Nd7!**

Black should usually develop his knight to d7 so that from d7 square the knight can also participate in the defence of the kingside.

**11.O-O Be7**

A prophylactic move.

**12.Nd4 Nc5 13.Bf3 Bd7=**

Black is ready to play ...Rc8 with a completely fine position. We can slowly put pressure on the weak pawn on c3. 1/2-1/2 (55) Mchedlishvili,M 2610 -Harikrishna,P 2725 St Petersburg 2018

## Catalan Opening #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 d5 3.c4 e6 4.g3**

Welcome to the Catalan! The Catalan has established itself as a solid opening for White. It is usually associated with positions where White can press for a long time without risking anything. The majority of lines that arise from this opening are positional. There are a lot of options for Black where he gets a solid position and these are generally considered as the mainlines. But in this repertoire, I am suggesting a line that is relatively fresh and will carry some element of surprise.

**4...dxc4 5.Bg2 c6**

I recommend this slightly rare and fresh line against the Catalan. It contains a little element of surprise and in most variations, we get fighting positions. However, some critical variations may end in a draw. GM Anton Guijarro is a strong advocate of this variation as this is his main weapon against the Catalan recently.

With 5...c6 we aim to defend our dear pawn on c4 with b7-b5. There are some options for White but essentially only two ways that White can respond to 5...c6. Either he can try to win the pawn on c4 as soon as possible, or he can aim for long-term compensation by sacrificing the pawn.

**6.Ne5**

White goes on the quest to win the pawn quickly by attacking it immediately.

**6...Bb4+**

An important intermediate check before we do something to defend our c4-pawn.

6...b5?! is not good for Black due to, 7.Nxc6

(7.a4 is also a very good alternative as Black is now forced to play, 7...Nd5 which we do not want to play unless White has a knight on c3 as whenever White plays e4 we can exchange the knight on c3. Otherwise, after e4 our d5-knight will be kicked back and White will gain time.)

7...Qb6 8.Na5! a nice tactical resource in order to fulfill positional aims. 8...Nd5

8...Qxa5+? 9.Bd2

9.Bd2 and the a5 knight teamed up with the g2 bishop is very annoying for Black as it is not so easy to complete our queenside development.

**7.Bd2 Be7!**

This was the point of ...Bb4+. We have provoked White's bishop to d2 and now the d4-pawn is hanging so White has to delay his plans of recovering the c4-pawn.

**8.e3**

White defends the d4-pawn and is now ready to capture on c4.

**8...b5!**

This leads to an interesting exchange sacrifice which the engines don't like for Black initially but as we go deeper they appreciate its strength! We support our advanced c4-pawn as it is more dear to us than the exchange.

**9.a4**

This makes sure that White wins the c4-pawn, but after,

**9...b4**

our b4-pawn completely dominates the b1-knight. Now, all we need to do is to focus on achieving the ...c5 break.

**10.O-O O-O 11.Qc2**

11.Nxc4 Ba6 12.b3 Nd5 we are going to play ...c5 next with a completely fine position for Black.

**11...Bb7**

this seems to be the simplest way for Black to prepare for the ...c5 break.

**12.Rc1 Qc8 13.Qxc4 c5!**

Temporarily sacrificing the c-pawn. With 13...c5 we not only prevent White's threat of Bxb4 but in general it is essential to successfully break with ...c5 as quickly as possible.

**14.Bxb7 Qxb7 15.dxc5 a5!**

Black is going to play ...Rc8 next and the c5-pawn is a temporary guest on the board. It is important to note that the Black pawns on b4 and a5 effectively cut any support for White's pawn.

## Catalan Opening #2

**6.O-O**

This indicates that White is aiming for long-term compensation.

**6...b5 7.Ne5**

7.b3 cxb3 8.axb3 Bb7 9.Ne5 transposes.

**7...Bb7 8.a4**

White starts to create pressure on the queenside.

**8...a6**

8...Qc8 was my initial recommendation, but then I rejected it because of, 9.b3 cxb3 10.Nd2 White should recapture the b3 pawn with the knight as the knight from b3 keeps a firm control on the c5 square preventing the ...c5 break. 10...Nbd7 11.Nxb3 b4 12.Nxd7 Qxd7 13.a5 Ba6 14.Qc2 With a firm control on the c5 square and some pressure on the c6 pawn White is slightly better here.

**9.b3 cxb3 10.Bb2 Nbd7 11.Qxb3**

11.Nxc6 Qb6 12.axb5 axb5 13.Rxa8+ Bxa8 14.Qc1 Bd6 Black will O-O next with a slightly better position. 1/2-1/2 (28) Williamson,D 2310-Emrich,E 2308 ICCF email 2016

**11...Nxe5 12.dxe5 Nd5=**

Black would like to simply play ...Be7 followed by O-O with a completely fine position as our knight is well placed on d5. 1/2-1/2 (21) Caressa,M 2248 -Avotins,M 2446 ICCF email 2011

## Deviations to the Vienna

**1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 d5 3.c4 e6 4.e3**

I have tried this move in a couple of games. In general White wants to avoid a theoretical debate and focus on a more strategic game and typical pawn structures like the Isolated Queen's Pawn, Hanging Pawns etc.

**4...a6**

A generally useful move. One of the ideas is to capture on c4 and when White recaptures with the bishop we can play b7-b5.

**5.b3**

White supports the c4-pawn so that he can recapture back with the b-pawn on c4.

5.Nbd2 should most probably transpose to our mainline after, 5...c5 6.b3

6.cxd5 can be met by, 6...Nxd5 7.Bd3 Nc6 8.O-O cxd4 9.exd4 Be7= Black had a comfortable version of the IQP. One thing to note here is that the knight on d2 is oddly placed and it should have been on c3. 0-1 (57) Cori,J (2652)-Svane,R (2613) chess.com INT 2020

6.dxc5 avoiding ...cxd4 has also been played in a few games. 6...Bxc5 7.a3 White obviously wants to play b4 and then Bb2. 7...dxc4 We use the same idea to develop our light-squared bishop with a tempo. 8.Bxc4 b5 9.Be2 Bb7 10.b4 Bd6 this retreat breaks the symmetry. Notice White's kingside bishop is on e2 whilst ours is placed actively on d6. 11.Bb2 O-O 12.O-O Nbd7 with pawns facing each other on b4 and b5, it is usually recommended to develop our knight from d7 so that it can go to b6 later. 13.Rc1 Qe7=

We are ready to bring our rooks into the game on the d- and c-files. Black is doing well in this position. 1/2-1/2 (76) Westerberg,J (2489) -Grandelius,N (2643) Uppsala 2016

**5...c5 6.Bb2 cxd4**

With this exchange we make sure and White ends up with hanging pawns. We will sooner or later also exchange pawns on c4.

**7.exd4 Nc6 8.Bd3**

8.Nbd2 g6!? developing the bishop to g7 is the best way to play in this structure. There might soon be hanging pawns on the board once we capture with ...dxc4. When this happens, our bishop will be strongly placed on the a1-h8 diagonal. 9.Bd3 Bg7 10.O-O O-O leads to the mainline.

**8...g6!?**

Fianchettoing the bishop on g7 is the best way to play against the hanging pawns. With the bishop on g7 we can put pressure on the d4-pawn.

**9.O-O Bg7**

GM Bacrot went for the direct

**10.c5**

But this is not such a well-timed advance as Black could have immediately broken with

**10...b6 11.cxb6 Qxb6**

I think Black is slightly better in this position. One of the main problems for White is Black's pressure on his d4-pawn. Because of this pressure, he cannot develop his knight actively with Nc3.

Black is ready to O-O next and later one can think of exchanging the light-squared bishops with ...a5 followed by ...Ba6.

## Vienna 5.Qa4

**1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 d5 3.c4 e6 4.Nc3 dxc4 5.Qa4+**

Very rarely have I faced 5.Qa4+ in my entire career with the Vienna opening. This move is more of an attempt to transpose into the Slav Defence. But we will avoid going into the Slav territory.

**5...Nbd7**

We block the check with the knight and not with our c-pawn because we want to go for the direct c7-c5 break in the future. Our ideal plan now is to play a7-a6, b7-b5, Bc8-b7 and then break with c7-c5. Of course, White will try his best to hamper our plans.

5...c6 6.Qxc4 b5 is a major alternative that transposes into the variations of the Slav Defence.

**6.e4!?**

This is the only challenging continuation here for White and rightly the most popular move which can create problems in our previously mentioned plans. White establishes control in the centre and prepares to capture on c4 with the bishop.

**6...a6 7.Bxc4 Rb8 8.Qc2 b5 9.Bd3 Bb7**

9...c5?! would be premature due to, 10.Bf4 Rb6 11.d5!

**10.O-O**

allows Black to play,

**10...c5 11.Bf4 Rc8 12.d5**

White maintains the tension in the centre.

**12...c4**

A typical reaction to d4-d5.

**13.Be2 Bb4**

This simple developing move is the best for Black. We now want to O-O next with an unbalanced but completely fine position.

13...exd5?! handed White some initiative after the strong - 14.Rad1! and White gets a good initiative on the d-file. 1-0 (31) (Berkes,F) (2675) (-Romanov,E) (2577) (Teplice CZE 2019)

## Vienna 5.Bg5

**1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 d5 3.c4 e6 4.Nc3 dxc4 5.Bg5**

This move is not seen frequently in tournament practice. With 5.Bg5 White develops his bishop and pins the knight on f6. He can later decide whether to play e2-e3 or e2-e4 next.

**5...a6!**

I believe this is the strongest reply against 5. Bg5. Black uses the fact that White has delayed recapturing the c4-pawn and prioritized the development of his dark-squared bishop.

With 5...a6 we prepare to support the c4-pawn with b7-b5, when it will be difficult for White to win the pawn at all.

5...c5 and 5...Bb4 are other possible options for Black.

**6.a4**

White prevents Black from supporting the c4-pawn with b7-b5 but it creates new weaknesses in White's queenside, for example, the b4 square is now weak.

**6...Nc6!**

Black finds a unique way of protecting his pawn on c4 and making it tough for White to recover it. Our knight is heading towards a5.

**7.e3 Na5 8.Ne5**

8.Nd2 would transpose to 8.Ne5 after, 8...Bb4 9.Nxc4

**8...Bb4**

The drawback of a2-a4. The black bishop is very stable on the b4 square and Black can utilize the pin on the c3-knight in a number of ways.

**9.Nxc4 Qd5!**

A very strong move for Black, activating the queen on the central d5 square from where it not only attacks the bishop on g5 and the knight on c4 but also keeps an eye on the g2-pawn thus making it difficult for White's light-squared bishop to develop easily.

This was the main point behind Black's previous move. The queen on d5 is quite annoying for White. This is also the starting point of complications where White walks on a very thin rope. A small mistake and the consequences could be lethal for White.

**10.Bxf6 Nxc4!**

This is the most challenging move for White as it contains a few tactical pitfalls that our opponent needs to be aware of.

10...gxf6 is also possible but 10...Nxc4 is stronger.

**11.Bxg7 Rg8**

The bishop on g7 is now attacked and so is the pawn on b2.

**12.Bh6?!**

is met by,

**12...Nxb2 13.Qc2 Qc6! 14.Kd2**

And now another tactical strike!

**14...Nxa4! 15.Rxa4 Bxc3+**

Black is already a pawn up and White's king is quite vulnerable. We have a clearly better position here. 0-1 (41) Kovats,J-Fuller,W (2221) ICCF email 2010

## Vienna 5.e3 #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 d5 3.c4 e6 4.Nc3 dxc4 5.e3 a6 6.a4**

This is the obvious alternative to 6.Bxc4 and the second most popular alternative for White. He prevents b7-b5 and aims to recapture the c4-pawn on the next move. With a2-a4 White manages to prevent Black's queenside expansion but at the same time weakens the b4 square permanently, which Black is going to use for his own benefit in the middlegame as well as in the endgame.

**6...c5**

6...b6 is another fighting alternative for Black.

**7.Bxc4 Nc6**

Since White has played a4, the knight is perfectly placed on c6, from where it eyes the weak square on b4.

**8.O-O Be7 9.Qe2**

The most popular move in this position for White. The white queen is usually well placed on e2, supporting the advance e3-e4. He also frees the d1 square for the rook.

**9...cxd4 10.Rd1**

The point of White's previous move. White brings his rook on the open file and makes sure that he is able to recover his pawn.

10.exd4?! offers no compensation for White after, 10...Nxd4 11.Nxd4 Qxd4 12.Rd1 Qg4 White lacks a clear compensation for the pawn.

**10...e5!**

We make it tough for White to recover his pawn! He will need to exchange a few pieces before he gets his pawn back.

10...O-O?! is inaccurate due to 11.Nxd4! giving White a slight initiative.

**11.exd4 exd4 12.Nxd4!**

With this tactical stroke White recovers his pawn.

12.Ne5?! can be met by, 12...O-O 13.Bf4 Bd7 and White still needs to figure out a way to recover the pawn. 1-0 (32) Jianu,V (2506)-Popov,V (2589) Dresden 2007 )

**12...Nxd4 13.Qe5**

The most popular move for White, but this leads to a completely equal endgame.

**13...Qd6!**

An important move forcing the exchange of queens.

**14.Qxd4**

14.Qxd6 Bxd6 15.Rxd4 transposes after 15...Bc5

**14...Qxd4 15.Rxd4 Bc5**

Black activates his bishop before castling. Our main plan next is to castle and then offer the exchange of the light-squared bishops with Bc8-e6.

We should not be afraid of ruining our pawn structure with Bxe6 - fxe6 because it opens the f-file and White's f2 pawn can become a target. There are many games played from this position, but Black's ideas remain the same.

## Vienna 5.e3 #2

**1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 d5 3.c4 e6 4.Nc3 dxc4 5.e3 a6 6.Bxc4 b5 7.Bb3**

This is more challenging than the other two retreats 7.Bd3 and 7.Be2

**7...Bb7**

A direct 7...c5 gives White an additional option of 8.e4 which was tried by Grischuk against Kramnik in the FIDE Candidates tournament, Berlin 2018.

8.O-O Bb7 transposes to our mainline.

**8.O-O c5 9.e4!?**

This is an interesting try that has gained some momentum recently. White offers a pawn in order to open up the lines in the centre. If Black does not accept the pawn sacrifice then White achieves his main aim that is to play e3-e4, increase control in the centre and play against the bishop on b7.

**9...cxd4**

eliminating the d4-pawn before it decides to march forward and gain space in the centre with d4-d5.

9...Nxe4? grabbing a pawn like this without completing development is poisonous! 10.Nxe4 Bxe4 11.Re1 White got a very strong initiative in the game, 1-0 (23) Adhiban,B (2701) -Albornoz Cabrera,C (2566) Havana CUB 2019

**10.Nxd4**

10.Qxd4?! Qxd4 11.Nxd4 Nc6= is just an inferior version on the mainline.

**10...Nc6**

I prefer this direct approach over 10...Nbd7. Black develops his knight as well as immediately challenges the strong central knight on d4.

**11.Nxc6 Qxd1**

It is important to immediately exchange the queens before White avoids it on the next move.

11...Bxc6 allows White to avoid the exchange of queens with 12.Qe2 White has more space in this position so keeping more pieces on the board favors him.

The white rook will also join the game on d1 gaining tempo on the black queen on d8. This position is of course playable for Black, but I prefer to play this structure without the queens on the board.

**12.Rxd1 Bxc6 13.f3**

White sets up a wall against Black's light-squared bishop, making it difficult for us to create play for this bishop. Moreover, White is ready to develop his dark-squared bishop and bring his rook into the game with Rac1 while Black will need more time to bring all his pieces in the game as his king is still in the centre. But the absence of the queens on the board makes it easy for Black to handle these problems.

13.Bg5? was tried in a game but it just loses a pawn after 13...Nxe4 14.Nxe4 Bxe4 15.a4 Be7! and Black was a clear pawn up in 0-1 (56) Repka,C (2513)-Sarana,A (2577) Moscow 2018 )

**13...Bc5+**

Not only activating the bishop with a check but also preventing White from playing Bc1-e3, which is an ideal square for White's dark-squared bishop.

**14.Kf1**

It makes sense to keep the king closer to the centre.

**14...Ke7**

Black too does the same. Now our rooks are connected and ready to participate on the open files. Black would like to first bring his kingside rook to d8 or c8.

**15.e5!**

This is the most critical test for Black in this position. The knight on f6 is kicked away from its active position and White prepares to develop the bishop with a check by 15.Bg5 This direct-developing move does not carry any challenge. 15...h6 This is Black's usual response whenever White's bishop comes on g5. We want to kick it back as soon as possible.

16.Bh4 g5 17.Bf2 Bxf2 18.Kxf2 Rhc8 19.Rac1 Nd7= Black is fine in this position without any problems. 1/2-1/2 (44) Ponomariov, R (2739)-Anand, V (2788) Moscow 2009

**15...Nd7 16.Bg5+ Ke8**

A counter-intuitive move, but a strong novelty! Just two moves back we connected our rooks and were ready to bring them into play. But now we are voluntarily shutting them down. This might seems worrisome for us but in fact, it is not.

First of all, 16...f6 was not an option for us, and secondly, by playing 15.e5 White has gained space but also exposed the e5-pawn to an attack by the black pieces.

The e5-pawn is now threatened and Black is ready to push back White's active dark-squared bishop from the h4-d8 diagonal with h7-h6 and g7-g5. Once the bishop moves away we can again play our king back to e7. In the meantime, White should figure out a way and waste time defending his e5-pawn.

## Vienna 5.e4 #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 d5 3.c4 e6 4.Nc3 dxc4 5.e4 Bb4 6.Bxc4**

This an interesting dynamic line for White. He ignores the threat of Black's previous move ...Bb4 (pinning the c3-knight and attacking the e4-pawn) and continues developing his pieces. This line became popular when Rustam Kasimdzhanov played it at the highest level against Boris Gelfand in the World Championship Candidates Semi-Final in Elista 2007. After this game 6.Bxc4 started appearing regularly in the Grandmaster encounters and it quickly became established as one of the main fighting replies against the Vienna Opening. Check out the model game Halkias vs. Perunovic, Kostic Memorial 2008, where White won a brilliant attacking game showing the dynamic potential of this line.

The main strategy for White in this line is that by sacrificing the pawn on e4 he aims for quick development. White will use his quick development by rapidly posting his pieces on aggressive squares where they will start exerting pressure on Black's position or hinder Black from developing his pieces. A major source of problem for Black is his bishop on c8. If Black's light-squared bishop manages to see the light of the day without ruining his overall position, then Black is usually doing fine. An important role in this line is played by Black's knight on b8. It craves to go on the kingside with a typical manoeuvre Nc6-e7-g6 or f5.

To sum up the introduction of this line, White's play is easier than Black's. For the sacrifice of the e4-pawn, he gets free play for his pieces. Black should know how to tackle White's quick development and initial pressure.

**6...Nxe4**

Black must accept the challenge. Otherwise, he would simply surrender the centre for free.

**7.O-O Nf6**

I believe retreating the knight is one of the most comfortable ways to play against the 6.Bxc4 line.<level/>

7...Nxc3 8.bxc3 Bd6!? is another interesting way to play and less explored compared to 8...Be7. I once played this line against the strong young Indian GM S.L. Narayanan and escaped with a draw after defending against his onslaught.

8...Be7 was established as the mainline here for Black. It is still doing fine, but Black gets a very passive position which is not to my taste.

**8.Bg5 O-O 9.Ne5**

Looks aggressive but we can easily meet it by

**9...Be7**

Bringing the bishop to where it needs to be. We unpin the f6-knight and our next move would be ...Nfd7, ...Nbd7 or ...Nc6, challenging White's active knight on e5.

**10.Re1 Nc6!**

It is beneficial for Black to exchange the strong white knight on e5 even at the cost of weakening our queenside pawn structure. It is necessary to develop our knight from the c6-square as we not only challenge the e5-knight but also threaten the d4-pawn.

**11.Nxc6 bxc6**

Now one of Black's main idea's is to play ...a5, gaining space on the queenside but more importantly making the idea of ...Ba6 available to develop our bishop and also offer the exchange of the light-squared bishops. Another idea for Black is to play ...c5 break under the right circumstances which would be when Black can comfortably meet White's reply of d4-d5 when we break with ...c5.

There are several options for White, so let us look at them one by one.

**12.Na4**

White controls the c5-square making it nearly impossible for us to break with ...c5.

12.Rc1 Bringing the rook to the c-file is also a possibility for White. 12...h6 again, we make a useful move before playing ...a5. 13.Bh4 a5! a typical space grabbing move for Black. 14.Bd3 White transfers his bishop to the b1-h7 diagonal hoping to create threats on the kingside. 14...c5! with the option of d4-d5 out of the way, Black can execute this pawn break smoothly. 15.dxc5 Ba6 offering the exchange of the light-squared bishops is generally favourable for Black in these positions. 16.Bxa6 Qxd1 17.Rexd1 Rxa6 after some forcing moves we have landed in an endgame with equal material. Black has the option of playing ...Rc6 next placing more pressure on the c5-pawn. So, if White plays - 18.Ne4 Black can play 18...Rb8 19.b3 a4= with good play on the queenside.

**12...h6**

White is anyways not going to exchange on f6, so ...h6 is just a useful move for the future.

**13.Bh4 a5**

gaining some space on the queenside as well as making the option of ...Ba6 available.

**14.Rc1**

White starts exerting pressure on the c-file.

**14...Nd5 15.Bxe7 Nxe7**

This is the correct capture intending to transfer our knight to f5 from where we can start pressurizing the d4-pawn.

**16.Nc5 Nf5 17.Re4 Qf6**

A strong move with the idea to play ...Rd8. Black's strategy is clear - to put pressure on the d4-pawn. It is up to White to find a comfortable way to defend it. Objectively the position is about equal but practically I prefer Black due to the weakness of the d4-pawn.

## Vienna 5.e4 #2

**1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 d5 3.c4 e6 4.Nc3 dxc4 5.e4 Bb4 6.Bg5 c5 7.e5**

This leads to sharp play where tactics dominate.

**7...cxd4 8.Qa4+!**

With this important check White quickly prepares to castle long and pin the d4-pawn.

**8...Nc6 9.O-O-O**

It is time to take a stock of the position on the board. White, for the moment, is 2 pawns down but has the lead in development.

White is already threatening to grab both Black's d4 and c4-pawns, while our f6 knight is pinned as well. This sharp situation requires sharp play, so it is vital to remember the correct continuation for Black.

**9...Bd7!**

With one move Black breaks two pins! The knight on c6 is unpinned, so is the pawn on d4, thus reigniting the threat of ...dxc3.

**10.Ne4 Be7 11.exf6 gxf6 12.Bh4**

Another important position of this line. White has managed to win a piece using tactics, but Black, on the other hand, has gained 3 important pawns. His pawns on c4 and d4 are well advanced and limit white's pieces.

Another very important concession that White made in the process of winning the piece is that he committed his king on the queenside where it is vulnerable. One of Black's main strategies from this position is to create play against the white king. Now Black has 3 moves that he has tried in practice and according to me, the simplest to understand and play is,

**12...a6!**

This silent little pawn move is quite annoying for White as it forces him to capture on c4 with the queen. If White does not take the c4-pawn then we are ready to advance on the queenside with b7-b5 when the black pawn avalanche on the white king looks dangerous just by its mere sight!

**13.Qxc4 e5!**

Another simple move, supporting the very important pawn on d4. For the past few moves Black has been defending against the threats from White and has just lost his pawn on c4 but what has he gained in return? Well, now the defending part is over and it is time to go on the offensive!

Black's previous move 13...e5 has firmly supported the pawn on d4 and also opened Black's light-squared bishop to come to active squares like e6 or f5. The black a8 rook is ready to come to c8 where combined with ideas like ...Nb4, it can create serious threats on the queenside. Another important fact is that the white queen is badly misplaced on the c-file.

Another way to give the piece back is,

**14.Bxf6 Bxf6 15.Nd6+ Ke7 16.Nxb7**

16.Nxf7? is bad due to, 16...Qa5 17.Nxh8 Rxh8−+ White has managed to win one of Black's rooks, but now Black is threatening to play ...Rc8 when we have a very strong attack against the white king.

**16...Qb6**

Now White needs to exchange queens with,

**17.Qc5+ Qxc5+ 18.Nxc5 Bc8**

The material is equal, but Black's central pawns and bishop pair guarantee him at least a slight edge.

## Vienna 5.e4 #3

**1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 d5 3.c4 e6 4.Nc3 dxc4 5.e4 Bb4 6.Bg5 c5 7.Bxc4**

This is White's most popular move. He captures the c4-pawn and prepares to O-O.

**7...cxd4**

We should take immediate action in the center before White is able to O-O and settle down. So, the next few moves are concrete in nature.

**8.Nxd4 Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 Qa5**

Threatening both the g5-bishop and the c3-pawn.

**10.Nb5**

This is the third most popular move in this position. White supports the c3-pawn and at the same time has ideas to exploit the control over the d6 and c7 squares, thanks to his active knight on b5. White is ready to sacrifice his e4-pawn for the initiative.

10.Nb5 requires concrete play from Black. The correct way to play against this has already been established long back. It is just important to remember the exact response from our side. This line gained its followers when the Ex-World Champion Anatoly Karpov played it in his match against Jan Timman in 1993.

**10...Nxe4**

10...O-O would be a mistake due to, 11.Bxf6 gxf6 12.Qg4+ Kh8 13.Qh4 Nd7 14.Rd1+− the white rook on d1 is all set to transfer to the kingside via d3, creating a very strong attack.

**11.Qd4**

This move looks quite scary and it seems that White has too many threats that we can handle. But in fact, we have a calm move at our disposal and some tactics working for us that helps us escape from the mess.

**11...O-O!**

A cool move, not worrying about the knight on e4.

11...Nxg5?? is of course a losing mistake due to, 12.Qxg7 Rf8 13.Qxg5+− with a black king on e8, we are doomed.

**12.Qxe4 a6**

This was the point behind our previous move. White's knight is tied down to the c3-pawn which prevents it from moving away from b5.

**13.Bd3**

Was the choice of the world champion Magnus Carlsen.

**13...f5**

When White is the one who should fight for equality.

**14.Qe2 axb5 15.O-O Nc6 16.Bd2 e5N**

Gaining space in the centre and preparing to develop the bishop actively with ...Be6.

**17.Rfb1 Qc7 18.Rxb5 Be6**

Black's position is perfectly comfortable. He has a strong centre and better pawn structure.

## Vienna 5.e4 #4

**10.Bxf6!?**

This is the second most popular move for White. He exchanges on f6 first and intends to 0-0 immediately next.

**10...Qxc3+**

Of course, we should not give him that chance. With the 10...Qxc3 intermezzo, we not only win a pawn but also deny White his castling rights.

**11.Kf1 gxf6**

It would be wrong to capture White's light-squared bishop due to, 11...Qxc4+? 12.Kg1 and now Black cannot escape with the 'logical' 12...O-O because of 13.Qg4 g6 14.e5+− when Black's dark squares are chronically weakened.

**12.Rc1**

12.Bb5+ should be met by, 12...Ke7

not, 12...Bd7?? due to, 13.Rc1+−<level start="12...Bd7"/>

13.Rc1 Qa5 transposes.

**12...Qa5!**

This is the only move in the position. It is important to control the c7 square preventing the white knight from arriving there in the future.

12...Qb4 looks logical but does not work due to, 13.Nb5! the white knight creates havoc. 13...Na6 14.a3 another strong move pushing the black queen to an inferior square. 14...Qc5

(14...Qa5 15.Qh5! Ke7 16.e5+−)

(14...Qe7 15.Nd6+ Kf8 16.Bxa6+−)

15.Nd6+ Ke7 16.Nxf7+−

**13.h4!?**

A typical move for White in this position. The main idea behind playing h2-h4 is to activate the rook via the 3rd rank with Rh1-h3. White can also use his h-pawn to push it further down the board if needed.

**13...Ke7!**

An important move for Black. The king is safe for now on e7. Black's main idea is to bring the h8-rook into the game. The bishop on c8 is not hanging anymore and Black has ideas to bring his rook into play with ...Rd8.

**14.Rh3 Nc6!**

14...Rd8?? is the most popular move here but it is a huge mistake! How can such a logical move be a huge mistake? Isn't it the main idea behind Black's previous move ...Ke7?

Well, yes, it was one of the main ideas for Black. However, it does not work in this exact position due to concrete reasons. White has a very strong move - 15.Re3!! White's threat is obvious. He wants to play Nf5+ next opening up the e-file, when Black's king will face the music. This threat of Nf5+ is very hard to meet and it is safe to say that White gets a winning attack here! 1-0 (41) Gagare,S (2491)-Kuzubov,Y (2638) Dubai 2016

**15.Nf5+?**

does not work now due to the simple,

**15...exf5 16.exf5 Ne5**

blocking the e-file.

**17.Re3 Bxf5**

Now Black's rooks are connected and ready to participate in the struggle.

White can continue with the logical, 18.f4 Pinning the e5-knight. 18...Rhd8 19.Qh5 Bg6 20.Qf3 and now it is time to bring the last piece in the game with, 20...Rac8 21.fxe5 fxe5 22.Rce1 f6−+ Black is two pawns up and has a winning advantage.

## Vienna 5.e4 #5

**10.Bb5+ Bd7**

This is Black's second most popular move. 10...Nbd7 is the most popular move here for Black and has been played in many top-level games. It is a good alternative to 10...Bd7.

After, 11.Bxf6 Qxc3+ 12.Kf1 gxf6 13.h4 the play is quite complex. Black has won a pawn but is behind in development on the queenside. White tries his best to get compensation for his sacrificed pawn. Until now, Black has performed satisfactorily in this line.

**11.Bxf6**

White needs to exchange on f6 as the bishop on g5 is always under the radar of the black queen on a5 and Black has ideas like ...Nxe4 in air.

**11...gxf6 12.Qb3**

Was the main move for White many years back and that is why we can find the most number of games played in this position with 12.Qb3. I believe this move is comparatively easier to face than the mainline 12.Bxd7+

**12...Bxb5 13.Nxb5 O-O 14.O-O Nc6 15.c4!**

A nice move. White prepares to swing his queen over to the kingside.

**15...Rad8**

We prepare for opportunities on the d-file.

**16.Qg3+ Kh8 17.Qh4 Kg7 18.f4**

Intending to include the rook in the attack. 18.Qg3+ leads to a repetition after 18...Kh8=

**18...Qd2**

We place our queen actively in our opponent's territory where it will also counter White's aggressive intentions.

18...Rd3 is possible, but 19.e5> might give White some attacking chances. 1-0 (35) Mamedyarov,S (2660)-Bluvshtein,M (2502) Mallorca 2004

## Deviations to avoid the Benko #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.Nf3 cxd4 4.Nxd4 e6**

There are a lot of options for Black, but I have chosen 4...e6 as Black usually gets a solid position in the arising lines. The idea of 4...e6 is obvious: we want to play ...Bb4+ on the next move.

**5.Nc3 Bb4**

Now White has 3 major moves in this position and all are different ways to support the knight on c3.

**6.Qb3**

White attacks the b4-bishop and supports the knight on c3 at the same time, but the queen itself is oddly placed on b3. Moreover, it withdraws the support of the knight on d4 which Black can use to gain tempo.

**6...Bc5**

The bishop is decently placed on c5 for now. Black now intends to develop his with ...b6, ...Bb7. The knight on b8 can be developed to either a6 or c6 according to the situation.

**7.Nf3 b6 8.Bf4 Bb7 9.e3 O-O 10.Rd1**

Playing against the ...d5 break.

**10...Nc6 11.Be2 Nh5N**

A strong idea forcing White to exchange the dark-squared bishop.

**12.Bg5**

is usually a typical response, but here, it is surprisingly bad due to

**12...f6!**

and we start kicking White's dark-squared bishop on every move!

**13.Bh4 g5! 14.Bg3 f5**

And Black gains a strong initiative on the kingside. The pawns on f5 and g5 look dangerous while the bishop on b7 is scary as well.

## Deviations to avoid the Benko #2

**5.g3 Bb4+ 6.Nc3**

With this move we enter the Romanishin variation of the Nimzo-Indian. I don't find the Romanishin variation very challenging to play against. With decent knowledge of the lines that we are going to study in the main course, you can confidently play against this variation.

**6...O-O 7.Bg2 d5**

This is the mainline against the Romanishin variation with over 1000 games played in it. Black immediately breaks in the centre and also hopes to put pressure on the pinned knight on c3 with subsequent moves. White now needs to address to our question that we posed to the c4-pawn.

**8.Qb3**

With this White forces Black to exchange his dark-squared bishop, but this loses some time which Black uses to develop his pieces quickly and put pressure on White.

**8...Bxc3+ 9.bxc3**

With this move White weakens his pawn structure but makes sure that Black does not get control over the centre, which Black is able to achieve in the variation with 9.Qxc3

**9...Nc6 10.cxd5 Na5 11.Qc2 Nxd5 12.O-O**

12.Qd3 was Kasparov's choice against Karpov in their World Championship match, but it went out of fashion as Black gets a fine position with, 12...Qc7 and now 13.Nb5 can be met by, 13...Qc6= when Black is doing fine.

**12...Bd7**

Preparing to bring the rook to c8.

**13.e4**

It is essential for White to kick the knight from the d5 square, otherwise the pressure on the c3-pawn will be too strong to handle for White.

**13...Nb6 14.e5**

White has gained space and hopes to create some pressure on the kingside where there are no Black pieces at the present. But, we have sufficient resources to defend against White's evil kingside intentions and at the same time put pressure on the weak c3-pawn.

**14...Rc8 15.Qe4**

Transferring the queen to the kingside.

**15...Qc7N**

The queen is useful on c7 putting pressure on both the c3 and the e5 pawns.

15...Rxc3? does not work due to, 16.Bd2 Rc5 17.Bb4 winning the exchange for White.

**16.Bg5!?**

a tricky move with the threat of Bg5-f6!

**16...Bc6**

This forces the exchange of the strong white knight on d4.

**17.Nxc6 Nxc6 18.Rfe1 Rfe8**

I believe the position is more or less balanced. White has the bishop pair but a weak pawn on c3 which will always be a cause of trouble for him.

Black can also meet White's attacking intentions by bringing his b6 knight into the defense with Nb6-d7 or Nb6-d5.

## Benko Gambit Declined 4.Nf3

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5 4.Nf3**

White develops his knight and waits for Black to capture on c4. Once Black captures on c4 then White will play Nc3 followed by e4.

**4...Bb7**

We in turn develop our bishop and put pressure on the d5-pawn which adds more value to the e7-e6 break. At the same time 4...Bb7 is a waiting move as well, not allowing White to develop his other knight to c3 immediately as it will be kicked with b5-b4.

4...bxc4 allows White to develop freely with, 5.Nc3 followed by e4 and then Bc4.

**5.a4**

White forces Black to make a decision on the queenside so that it would be clear for him to develop the knight on c3 or on d2.

5.Nc3?! does not make sense as we simply kick the knight with, 5...b4 6.Na4 d6 followed by ...g6-Bg7 and O-O when we get a better version of the mainline as here the white knight is stranded on a4.

On 5.e3 we simply continue with, 5...g6 followed by ...Bg7 and O-O. White has to make a decision on the queenside at some point. Otherwise, it will be difficult for him to develop normally.

**5...Qa5+!?**

This is a nice intermediate move before playing b5-b4. We would like to lure the white bishop to d2 first before going for b5-b4.

The point behind this is that White will have to waste one more move with his dark-squared bishop in order to free the d2 square for his b1 knight. Another point is that White will not be able to fianchetto his dark-squared bishop with b2-b3 and Bc1-Bb2. Thus, our dark-squared bishop will be unopposed on the a1-h8 diagonal.

**6.Bd2 b4**

Now we can see that the bishop is misplaced on d2 and its place belongs on the b2-square.

Our main plan now is quite simple. We want to play ...d6-Nbd7-g6-Bg7-O-O and then play e7-e5. Once we do this then we get a better version of the King's Indian as the queenside is closed here and White lacks his traditional counterplay on the queenside.

**7.Bg5**

White vacates the d2-square for his knight.

**7...d6 8.Bxf6?!**

Parting with the dark-squared bishop is obviously bad for White.

**8...exf6**

Black's plan is simple. We want to play ...Nd7 followed by O-O-O. Then we can also fianchetto our dark-squared bishop and start playing on the kingside.

**9.Nbd2**

9.e4 g6 10.Bd3 Bg7 11.O-O Nd7 12.Ne1 O-O-O 0-1 (23) Loeffler,S (2405) -Krivoshey,S (2449) Germany 2002

9.h4 can be simply met by, 9...Nd7 10.e4 O-O-O Black's king is very safe on the queenside and we can focus on playing on the kingside now. 0-1 (43) Llopis de Aysa,M (2023) -Kasparov,S (2470) Berlin 2016

**9...g6**

Intending to fianchetto our bishop.

**10.Nb3 Qc7 11.Nc1**

An interesting manoeuvre by White, but it does make any difference in the overall position. We continue with our plan of queenside castling.

11.a5 can also be a possibility. But it does not hinder our plans in any way. 11...Bg7 preparing to ...O-O and then later play ...f5. 12.Nc1 White transfers his knight to a better square on d3. 12...O-O 13.e3 f5 threatening to capture the b2-Pawn. 14.Nd3 Nd7 and now if White decides to advance his a-pawn further with 15.a6 then it just helps Black after 15...Bc8−+ First of all, White has helped us to relocate our bishop to a better square as it was not doing anything on b7. Secondly, the a6-pawn itself becomes a target for Black's pieces.

For example, Black now aims to play ...Rb8 followed by ...Rb6. The a6-pawn will be lost soon, giving Black a winning advantage.

**11...Nd7 12.e3 Bg7 13.Nd3 f5**

Black has set-up an ideal pawn structure on the kingside. Also, we can feel the power of our dark-squared bishop as it is unopposed on the long diagonal.

**14.Nd2 Nf6 15.Be2 a5 16.Qc2 O-O-O**

With the black king tucked in safely on the queenside we have a clear edge on the kingside.

## Benko Gambit Declined 4.Qc2

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5 4.Qc2**

White develops his queen not to support the c4-pawn but to prepare the pawn advance e2-e4.

**4...bxc4 5.e4**

5.Qxc4? is of course not White's idea as the queen is misplaced on c4. 5...e6 6.e4 exd5 7.exd5 Na6! a strong move, the knight aims to go to b4 or c7 and put pressure on the d5-pawn. We can clearly see the drawback of having the queen on c4, the pawn on d5 lacks sufficient support. 8.a3

(8.Nc3 Nb4 9.Qb3 Qa5! 10.Bd2 Ba6 and Black gets a strong initiative.)

8...Nc7 9.Nc3 Bb7 White simply loses the d5-pawn. It makes no difference if White pins the f6-knight with 10.Bg5 as Black can still grab the pawn with 10...Ncxd5 11.Nxd5 Bxd5 12.Bxf6 the forcing moves continue. 12...Bxc4 13.Bxd8 Bxf1 14.Kxf1 Kxd8−+ and Black ends up a clear pawn ahead in the endgame.

**5...e6**

We hit in the centre immediately as we have done in some other variations of the Benko.

5...d6 6.Bxc4 g6 is a popular way of playing in this variation.

**6.Nc3 exd5 7.e5**

White kicks the f6-knight so that he could recapture the d5-pawn with his knight.

7.Nxd5?! will lead to an inferior version of the mainline. The difference is that after, 7...Nxd5 8.exd5 Be7 9.Bxc4 O-O 10.Nf3 d6 11.O-O Nd7 Black has the f6 square easily available for our bishop which we need to work for in the mainline.

7.exd5 d6 8.Bxc4 Be7 9.Nf3

9.Nge2 O-O 10.O-O transposes to the mainline.

9...O-O 10.O-O transposes to the mainline.

**7...Bb7!**

This simple developing move is surprisingly the best for Black. We sacrifice the f6-knight in favour of the d5-pawn!

7...Ng4 is inferior due to, 8.Nxd5 Nxe5 9.Qe4

(9.Nf3 0-1 (27) Wichmann,C (2361)-Pap,M (2501) Bad Woerishofen 2012)

9...d6 and now the simple developing move, 10.Nf3! is sufficient to guarantee at least a slight edge. 10...Nbc6 11.Bxc4 White dominates the central squares and Black's king is stuck in the centre. 11...Be7 12.Nxe5 Nxe5

(12...dxe5? 13.Nxe7+− loses for Black.)

13.Bb5+⩲ this forces Black's king to move. Even though Black will still be a pawn up, it matters little as White's d5-knight is very powerful plus Black's king will be a source of trouble.

**8.exf6 Qxf6 9.Nf3 Be7N**

A simple developing move preparing to O-O next. We should wait for White to play Be2 so that we get to advance ...d4 followed by ...d3 attacking the bishop on e2 as well as White's queen.

9...Na6 0-1 (26) Grehling, M (2190)-Gierth, K (2187) GER email 2010

9...d4? is a wrong timed pawn advance. White has a simple refutation - 10.Nb5+− followed by bxc4 when White wins an important pawn.

**10.Be2 d4!**

This is the correct time to advance the pawn as the White bishop has arrived on e2.

**11.Nb5**

White creates counter-threats on the queenside.

**11...d3 12.Qxc4 dxe2 13.Nc7+ Kd8**

From the d8-square the king covers the white knight's retreat square.

**14.Nxa8 Qg6**

Threatening to capture the g2-pawn. The position is quite dynamic with both the kings still in the centre and an unbalanced material correlation.

I have analyzed this position further in the main course and have found that Black is doing well against all of White's replies here.

## Benko Gambit Accepted Sidelines #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5 4.cxb5 a6 5.f3**

With this move White intends to build a solid centre with the f3-e4-d5 pawn chain. White is ready to sacrifice the pawn on b5 as he knows that after he plays e2-e4, Black will have to waste moves to defend the b5-pawn. All in all, I don't think that this is a challenging variation and Black has various ways to deal with this confidently.

**5...e6!?**

This is the second most popular move and it leads to interesting complications. With 5...e6 we hit the centre immediately and do not allow White to consolidate in the centre.

I have tried, 5...axb5 6.e4 Qa5+ which gave me good results and is one of the main replies to the 5.f3 variation. This variation is already covered in some books and courses so I decided to recommend a fresh line where we explore uncharted territory.

5...g6 6.e4 d6 or 6...Bg7 is another decent option for Black.

**6.e4 exd5 7.e5**

This is White's only challenging try. White pushes our active f6-knight back before developing his own pieces.

**7...Qe7 8.Qe2 Ng8 9.Nc3**

9.Nh3 c4 10.Nc3 Bb7 transposes to the mainline.

**9...Bb7**

This is an important position where White has tried a few different moves.

**10.Nh3**

This is by far White's best move. 10.Nh3 not only develops the knight but also plans to develop his dark-squared bishop with tempo by Bg5.

**10...c4!**

An important pawn advance for Black. This cuts the support of the b5-pawn and gains space for Black on the queenside. It also frees the c5 and b4 square for the black queen.

**11.Be3**

is another possibility preparing to O-O-O. The drawback is that the e5-pawn hangs which Black can capture at an appropriate moment.

**11...axb5 12.O-O-O**

12.Nf4 is met by, 12...Qxe5 13.Nxb5 Na6 14.Bd4 Qxe2+ 15.Bxe2 Bc6 16.Nc3 Nb4! threatening ...Nc3 which forces the white king to stay in the centre. 17.Kd2 Ne7 With the idea to play ...Ng6 or ...Nf5 next.

Black is a pawn up, however, White has some compensation as he blocks the black pawns in the centre. Nevertheless, I believe his compensation is not sufficient here and Black has a slight edge.

**12...Na6**

A typical developing square for the b8-knight.

**13.Nf4 Qxe5**

Black is surprisingly two pawns up at this point, but our king is still in the centre and our kingside is undeveloped. White has some compensation and he will try to create some initiative. But Black has all the resources to defend comfortably against White's threats.

**14.Bb6**

14.Nfxd5 b4! this forces the exchange of queens. 15.Bf2 Qxe2 16.Nxe2 Bxd5 17.Rxd5 Be7 With the idea to play ...Nf6.

**14...Qxe2 15.Bxe2 h5!**

A nice way of bringing the h8-rook into play.

**16.Nfxd5 Rh6**

White still needs to prove compensation for his pawn loss. I believe Black is slightly better here.

## Benko Gambit Accepted Sidelines #2

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5 4.cxb5 a6 5.Nc3!?**

This is an interesting line known as the Zaitsev Line. White's main idea behind this line is to plant his knight on the b5 square, into enemy territory.

**5...axb5 6.e4**

Only this way, by sacrificing his e4-pawn can White hope to establish his knight on the b5 square. White does not care much about losing the e4-pawn as if Black captures it then he can create threats down the e-file.

**6...b4 7.Nb5 d6**

Now Black is ready to snatch the e4-pawn. If White defends it directly or indirectly then we can simply play ...g6 followed by ...Bg7 and O-O. In general, whenever we take the pawn on e4, White gets good long term compensation. So, I feel it is easier to just play ...g6, ...Bg7 followed by ...O-O and then continue playing strategically.

It would be great if we could win the e4-pawn immediately with, 7...Nxe4?? but it is not possible due to, 8.Qe2! and we surely don't want to get mated in the opening after, 8...Nf6?

(8...f5 9.f3+−)

9.Nd6#

**8.Nf3**

White ignores the threat to the e4-pawn hoping to create pressure on the e-file in the near future.

**8...g6**

8...Nxe4 is completely possible but I don't like the position after, 9.Bc4 g6 10.Qe2 f5

(10...Nf6? leads us into the same tactical trap that we see in the 8.Bc4 variation. 11.Bf4! Ra6 12.Nxd6+)<level start="8.Bc4"/>

11.Ng5 Bg7 12.O-O O-O 13.Re1 Initially the engines prefer this position for Black. But analysing for a while I concluded that it is not so easy to play here for Black because of the pressure on the e-file. 1-0 (39) Demidov,M (2534) -Salman,P (2197) Moscow 2017

**9.Bc4?!**

The bishop is poorly placed on c4 in this position as it can be hit by the black knight after ...Nbd7 and ...Nb6.

**9...Bg7 10.O-O O-O 11.Re1 Nbd7 12.a4**

This is a typical pawn advance for White but here the a4-pawn becomes a target after,

**12...Nb6! 13.Bf1 Bd7**

Now Black threatens to play ...Ra5 followed by taking the a4-pawn when the knight on b5 falls and we will be a clear pawn up.

Another idea is to play ...Ne8 when we can aim to exchange the b5 knight with ...Nc7 or by playing ...f5 weakening the d5-pawn.

## Benko Gambit Accepted #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5 4.cxb5 a6 5.e3**

This is another way to maintain the pawn lead. White prefers to keep the pawn on b5 and waits for Black to capture on b5 so that he could develop his bishop in one move straight to b5.

White does not want to help Black in developing his queenside pieces by capturing on a6 with 5.bxa6, which is the mainline. The drawback is White will be one move late in setting up his ideal pawn structure in the centre (e4-d5) with Nb1-c3 followed by e3-e4 which he manages to do quickly in the mainline 5.bxa6. White's main follow-up is to play Nb1-c3, Ng1-f3, a2-a4, Ra1-a3.

With this White would like to degrade Black's counterplay on the queenside. Therefore, instead of focusing on the queenside, we will focus on the centre.

**5...g6**

Black goes for the traditional Benko set-up. Now as mentioned earlier, if you compare this to the mainline 5.bxa6 which we will examine here, White will be a move late in getting his pawn to e4.

We would like to use this precious time and hit in the centre with Bc8-b7 followed by e7-e6 at the right moment before White settles down comfortably.

**6.Nc3 Bg7**

Now White has various options here, but in most of the cases he plays Ng1-f3 sooner or later, which will transpose into the mainline.

We will analyse those options where White will be developing his knight anywhere but the f3 square in the main course.

**7.Nf3**

7.e4 O-O 8.a4 Bb7 9.Nf3 Transposes to the mainline after 7.Nf3

**7...O-O 8.a4**

This is generally a useful move for white on the queenside.

**8...Bb7 9.Ra3**

This is a typical square for the white rook in this structure. The idea of putting the rook on a3 is that now the a4-pawn is not pinned anymore and the rook also moves to a safer square away from a1-h8 diagonal which is always a cause of concern for White in the Benko. The knight on c3 gets added protection and on ...axb5 White always has the option of axb5.

**9...e6 10.dxe6**

Seeing that it is not easy to maintain the centre control, White goes for the exchange with 10.dxe6.

**10...fxe6**

A logical recapture, Black now plans to play d7-d5, seizing control in the centre.

**11.Qd6!**

A challenging reply. White not only prevent Black's ...d5 advance but attacks the pawn on c5 at the same time.

**11...Nd5!?**

This is a very rare move and only one game has been played to date with this move. By playing 11...Nd5 we open the a1-h8 diagonal for our dark-squared bishop and also the f-file for our rook which will help us create counter-chances. Black's immediate threat is to play ...Nb4 when meeting the threat of ...Nc2 will be very uncomfortable for White.

11...axb5 is a fine alternative as well. 1/2-1/2 (22) Tillotson, C-Sieh,L IECC email 1996)

**12.Nxd5 Bxd5 13.Qxc5?!**

is again dubious because it wastes valuable time.

**13...axb5 14.Bxb5 Nc6 15.Qc2**

The 'logical' 15.O-O? is crushed by 15...Rxf3!−+ When White's kingside will collapse.

**15...Rxf3!**

A strong exchange sacrifice making sure that White can never O-O.

**16.gxf3 Bxf3**

And Black has very strong compensation for the exchange. White's king is in the centre and will face problems. Black's bishops are strong too and we can try to create threats on the c-file.

A sample variation could be 17.Rg1 Nb4 18.Qd2 Qc7 with the double threat of ...Nc2+ and ...Qxh2. 19.Rg3! Nc2+ 20.Kf1 Nxa3 21.bxa3 Bd5= The material is more or less balanced as the doubled a-pawns do not count for much.

## Benko Gambit Accepted #2

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5 4.cxb5 a6 5.b6**

White gives the pawn back immediately and aims for a positional struggle ahead.

**5...e6**

I believe this is a very straightforward way to achieve complete equality. We immediately start grappling in the centre before White gets a chance to increase the hold with Nb1-c3 and e2-e4.

The pawn on b6 is going nowhere and will be won sooner or later. 5...d6 followed by ...Nbd7 and then recapturing the b6-pawn with our knight is another formidable alternative for Black. 5...e6 is more concrete and direct in nature.

**6.Nc3 Nxd5**

6...exd5 leads to the same thing as 6...Nxd5

**7.Nxd5 exd5 8.Qxd5 Nc6**

There have been a couple of exchanges on d5 and it might seem that White has gained a nice control on this square. But in fact, the queen is a very unstable piece on d5 as it can be easily chased away. So White still needs a few moves to complete his development and establish proper control on d5. Black would like to play Bf8-e7 followed by 0-0 and then taking the pawn on b6.

**9.Nf3**

White not only develops his knight but also threatens Nf3-e5 at the same time, exploiting the Pin on the c6 knight.

**9...Rb8**

Side-stepping White's idea of Nf3-e5. Black anyways wanted to play Ra8-b8 and grab the pawn on b6 with his rook. With the rook active on the b-file we create pressure on the b-file.

Our intended, 9...Be7?! is, of course, inferior here due to, 10.Ne5! The benefit of playing 9.Nf3 immediately. 10...O-O 11.Nxc6 dxc6 12.Qxd8 Bxd8<level start="9.Nf3"/>

(12...Rxd8? 13.Bf4+− 1-0 (39) Karpov, A (2725) -Christiansen, L (2620) Wijk aan Zee 1993)

13.e4 and because of Black's weak queenside pawns White has better chances. 1-0 (48)Grabarczyk,M (2480) -Ehrenfeucht,W (2290) Warsaw 1997

**10.Ne5 Qf6!**

Defending the f7-pawn as well as attacking White's e5-knight.

**11.Nxc6 dxc6 12.Qe4+ Be7 13.g3**

White prepares to fianchetto his bishop and then O-O safely.

**13...O-O 14.Bg2 Rxb6 15.O-O Be6**

Both sides have completed their development. Black has a weak pawn structure on the queenside but it is comfortably compensated by the pressure his pieces creates on b2- and a2-pawns.

**16.Bf4 Rb4!**

An important intermediate move creating favourable circumstances to take on b2.

**17.Qxc6**

17.Be5 leads to a draw after 17...Qg5 18.Bf4 Qf6=

**17...Rxb2 18.Qxa6 c4**

Was the correct move here for Black. The e2-pawn hangs and Black aims to push the c-forward when it will become a real headache for White. Black keeps the initiative.

## Benko Gambit Accepted #3

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5 4.cxb5 a6 5.bxa6 g6 6.Nc3 Bg7 7.e4 O-O**

This is a critical point where White has three main lines.

**8.Nf3**

is the most popular among these 3 but also the easiest one to meet.

**8...Qa5 9.a7??**

now might be too late because of,

**9...Nxe4!**

The threats on the c3 knight are too much for White to handle.

**10.axb8=Q**

10.Bd2 is lame. Black simply plays, 10...Nxd2 11.Qxd2 Rxa7 We regain our pawn and also maintain our trademark counterplay on the queenside.

We have managed to exchange White's dark-squared bishop, which means that our bishop on g7 is now unopposed on the long a1-h8 diagonal. (28) Michenka,J (2329)-Gallego Alcaraz,A (2504) Pardubice 2018

**10...Rxb8**

Now White has tried different ways to avoid losing the material back, but nothing really works for him.

**11.Qd3 Nxc3 12.Bd2 Rxb2 13.Rc1**

White is ready to recover the knight on c3 on the next move, but Black has a strong resource,

**13...Qa3N**

This is the strongest move for Black in this position, securing a winning advantage.

**14.Rxc3 Bxc3 15.Bxc3 Rxa2**

White's king is badly stuck in the centre and has no hopes of getting away from Black's active pieces. Black has crushing threats like ...Qc1+ and ...Ba6 giving us a winning advantage.

## Benko Gambit Accepted #4

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5 4.cxb5 a6 5.bxa6 g6 6.Nc3 Bg7 7.e4 O-O 8.a7**

White sacrifices the pawn one square forward in order to lure the black rook to the a7 square where it can prove to be vulnerable.

**8...Rxa7 9.Nf3 e6!**

This is the correct way of playing here. We would like to capture ...exd5 after White recaptures with the pawn we may use the open e-file for creating counterplay. The placement of the rook on a7 supports this idea as we can double on the e-file with ...Re7 and ...Re8. With the rook on a7, we can also think of doubling and putting pressure down the a-file.

With the rook on a7, our main idea of, 9...Qa5 does not work due to, 10.Bd2 and now if, 10...Ba6?? then White has 11.Nb5!+− attacking the queen on a5 as well as the rook on a7. This is White's main point of giving up his a-pawn on a7 so that Black's rook on a7 can be used for such tactics.

**10.Be2 exd5 11.exd5 d6 12.O-O**

White has completed his kingside development and is a pawn up. But Black will exert pressure on the queenside in a typical Benko style on the a- and b-files supported by a strong bishop on g7 which exerts pressure on the long diagonal a1-h8.

Another important point to note here is that in the absence of e-pawns from the board, the white pawn on d5 can also become a target for the black pieces. Usually, a white pawn stands on e4 giving protection to the d5-pawn, but here Black has ideas like ...Bb7, ...Qa8, ...Nb4 in order to pressurize the d5-pawn.

**12...Na6**

We start with developing our knight. This knight can further go to c7 or b4 according to the situation.

**13.Nb5 Rd7**

Protecting the d6-pawn in advance which can be threatened by moves like Bc1-f4.

**14.Bc4**

White in turn protects his d5-pawn in advance, before Black starts piling up pressure on it.

**14...Bb7 15.Qb3**

Freeing the d1-square for the f1 rook to join in the defence of the d5-pawn.

**15...Qa8 16.Rd1 Nc7!**

It is important to exchange White's active knight on b5 so that the b-file would be open which can be used to create counterplay.

The aggressive, 16...Nb4?! is bad due to, 17.Bf4 Rfd8 18.Nc3! and White is ready to kick the knight back from b4 with a2-a3. Bluebaum,M (2620) -Papp,G (2591) Austria 2018

**17.Nxc7 Rxc7 18.Bf4 Rd8**

This is an important position to assess. White still maintains his one pawn lead and has also completed his queenside development. He seems to be slightly better here but things are not so easy especially in practical play.

The a- and b-files as well as the a1-h8 long diagonal are an evergreen source of counterplay for Black. The d5-pawn is a target as well which White needs to take care of all the time. Black can consider activating his light-squared bishop on the kingside via c8 or offer an exchange with ...Ba6.

The f6-knight usually falls back on e8 protecting the d6-pawn and opening up the diagonal a1-h8 for our dark-squared bishop.

## Benko Gambit Accepted #5

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5 4.cxb5 a6 5.bxa6 g6 6.Nc3 Bg7 7.e4 O-O 8.e5**

I believe this is the most challenging move and a nightmare for most of the Benko players, including me. White straight away starts an onslaught against the black king. This variation requires very concrete handling, so I would urge the readers to remember the variations as well as understand them well.

**8...Ne8 9.h4!**

This is the main point behind White's previous move. He has kicked our knight from f6 so that he can use the absence of the knight by immediately creating pressure on the kingside with h2-h4-h5.

**9...Bxe5!**

I believe this is Black's best try to fight in this position. It is essential to eliminate the e5-pawn immediately so that we can arrange our pieces appropriately in order to face White's onslaught. Once we address and slow down White's kingside attack then we can focus on creating our own counterplay.

**10.Bh6**

This is the accurate way to put pressure. White's best setup is to put the bishop on h6 and the queen on d2. If White delays going for this, then Black will prevent it from happening immediately and to make it happen later on will be time-consuming for White. Timing and tactics are the two most crucial factors in this variation!

**10...Ng7**

The best way to block the bishop on h6. The knight can also serve some defensive purposes from g7.

**11.Nf3 Bf6 12.h5 d6**

We have reached a critical juncture where White has to decide how to continue with the attack. I have analyzed two possibilities for White in the main course.

**13.Qd2 Qa5!**

The a5 square is the best for the black queen in this position in terms of creating counterplay. From a5 it puts pressure on the c3-knight and also the a2-pawn if White moves his rook from a1.

**14.Ng5 Nxa6**

With the rook on a1 I would recommend recapturing on a6 with the knight. The main idea behind this is that in case White decides to castle long then we have ...Nb4 which will create an irresistible attack on the white king. With a white rook on a1 it is generally not recommended to take on a6 with the bishop.

14...Bxa6? 15.hxg6 fxg6 16.Bxg7+−

**15.Bd3 Bf5**

challenging the bishop directly.

15...Nb4 16.Bb1 Bf5 17.Nxh7 Kxh7

(17...Bxb1 18.Nxf6+ exf6 19.Rxb1± It might look dangerous for White to have the king on e1, but objectively White is doing great here. He is a pawn up and has threats on the kingside.)

18.hxg6+ fxg6 19.Bxf5 Nxf5 20.Bxf8+ Kg8 21.Bh6 c4 22.O-O +− and Black lacks compensation here.

**16.Nxh7 Bxc3!!**

This is a very important and critical move to remember in this position. This exchange on c3 is essential because we want our f8-rook to support our f5-bishop. We will see the point soon, 16...Kxh7? loses by force to, 17.hxg6+ fxg6 18.Bxf5 gxf5 19.Bxg7+ Kxg7 20.Qh6+ Kf7 21.Qh5+! leads to mate on the next move!

**17.bxc3 Kxh7 18.hxg6+ fxg6**

Now we can see that our f8-rook is protecting the bishop on f5.

**19.Bxf5 Rxf5**

And the black rook makes sure that we don't get mated on the kingside. Black is fine here.
