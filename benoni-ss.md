## 3. g3 #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 e6 3.g3**

White delays c4 for now and first wants to fianchetto the bishop to g2 and castle.

**3...c5**

The typical break in the spirit of the Benoni. Of course, Black has other good alternatives like 3...d5 transposing to the Catalan, or 3...b5 which is another way to exploit the fact that White has delayed playing c4.

**4.Bg2 cxd4**

Of course, we want to take this pawn.

**5.Nxd4**

Sooner or later White has to take the pawn back.

**5...d5**

We get a foothold in the centre.

**6.O-O e5**

We use this opportunity to drive the knight away, while creating new possibilities for our light-squared bishop.

**7.Nb5**

This is a bit provocative, but White cannot expect the knight to remain on b5.

**7...a6!**

Driving the knight away.

**8.N5c3 Be6**

This is more ambitious than 8...d4 9.Ne4 Be7 with equality, where White can attack the d4-pawn.

**9.Bg5 e4**

Defending the d5-pawn and preventing White from playing e4.

**10.Bxf6 gxf6**

The doubled pawns are not so bad as they reinforce our centre.

**11.e3 f5**

Now e4 is safely guarded.

**12.Ne2 Nc6**

We have easy development because of our strong centre and space advantage.

**13.c3 h5**

Trying to open the position on the kingside. Even if we lose this pawn, we get enough compensation in the form of a potential attack on White?s king.

**14.h4**

Forced. White would be losing if our pawn is allowed to march forward to h4.

**14...Ne5**

The knight feels good on e5. It keeps open possibilities to jump to each side of the board.

**15.Nf4 Bd6∞**

We're going to castle long and put a rook on g8 with a good position in the centre and on the kingside. Of course, it's a big mistake for White to take the h5-pawn, as this would only open up the position and give us a winning attack.

## 3. g3 #2

**7.Nb3**

A natural retreat.

**7...Be6**

The bishop belongs here in order to defend the centre.

**8.Nc3**

The most common move in this position.

**8...Be7 9.Bg5**

Indirectly attacking the d5-pawn.

**9...Nbd7**

This is an important nuance. The d5-pawn is now defended.

**10.e3**

Preparing to play f4.

**10...h6**

Clearing up the the situation with the pin on the f6-knight.

**11.Bxf6 Nxf6 12.f4 e4!?**

It makes sense to shut in White's g2-bishop.

**13.f5 Bc8**

The only square for the bishop to keep the d5-pawn protected.

**14.Qd4 b5!**

An important move. This pawn sacrifice makes way for the bishop to come to b7 in order to defend the centre, and also prevents an annoying check on a4.

**15.Nxb5 O-O 16.Nc3 Bb7**

This was played in 1/2-1/2 (72) Kravtsiv,M (2677)-Moroni,L (2506) Heraklion 2017. The activity of Black?s pieces more than compensates for the missing pawn.

## Colle System #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 e6 3.e3**

The Colle System. White is building up the position slowly, and is going for a setup with Bd3, b3 and Bb2. This system is popular in blitz and rapid even among top players. Although it's not so ambitious, White develops all the pieces to good squares and gets a playable position.

**3...d5**

As much as I prefer to avoid symmetry, this seems more natural to me than 3...c5.

**4.Bd3 c5**

We can fight for the centre straight away. A good alternative is 4...Bd6, but that is too symmetrical for me!

**5.b3**

Preventing ...c4 and getting ready to fianchetto the bishop.

**5...b6**

We need to solve the problem of our light-squared bishop. 5...Nc6 followed by ...b6 and ...Bb7 should lead to the same thing.

**6.Bb2 Bb7 7.O-O Nc6**

This is the setup I recommend: ...Nc6, ...Be7 and ...O-O. Afterwards we can act depending on what White does.

**8.Nbd2 Be7**

I prefer the bishop on e7, although 8...Bd6 is also good.

**9.Ne5**

White players are usually fond of this knight jump.

**9...O-O**

We bring our king to safety.

**10.a3**

Preventing ...Nb4.

**10...Qc7**

A useful move. It connects the rooks, we can meet 11.Nxc6 with 11...Qxc6, and also in case of 11.c4 we are now ready to play 11...Rad8.

**11.f4**

Preparing a quick Rf3.

**11...a5**

We follow up with our standard plan.

**12.Qf3?**

This is an instructive blunder.

**12...c4!**

It?s hard to believe, but all the tactics work out for Black!

**13.Be2 c3!**

Luring the bishop to c3.

**14.Bxc3 Nxe5 15.fxe5 Ne4!**

One last important detail. Black wins a piece.

## Colle System #2

**13.bxc4 dxc4 14.Nexc4 b5!**

It's over. The white knight is trapped, as e5 is a mined square.

## 4. Nc3 #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 e6 3.c4 c5 4.Nc3**

White avoids playing 4.d5, which would lead to the Benoni, and fights for the centre by developing the knight. We have now entered a line of the English Opening.

**4...cxd4**

We usually get rid of the d4-pawn if possible.

**5.Nxd4 d5**

We are following a central strategy. Black has other choices here like 5...Bb4 or 5...Nc6. However, I think 5...d5 is sound and simple.

**6.Bf4**

White develops the bishop and only then plays e3. Thus White is fighting for a small advantage.

**6...Nbd7**

With the threat of ...e5. In order to counter this threat White has to lose more time. 6...Nc6 is possible and looks more natural, but in that case ...e5 is not really a threat as White can always answer Nxc6.

**7.Qa4**

By pinning the knight White avoids ...e5.

**7...Bc5**

Again developing a piece with tempo.

**8.Nb3**

Immediately going for the c5-bishop.

**8...O-O**

This is safe. Instead, 8...d4!? would involve a pawn sacrifice.

**9.Nxc5 Nxc5 10.Qa3**

There are no better squares for the queen.

**10...b6**

Defending the knight and preparing ...Bb7.

**11.Rd1 Bb7**

The bishop belongs on the long diagonal. We already have a sizable advantage in development!

**12.e3 Qe7**

Getting the queen out of the pin on the d-file.

**13.Bg3**

Preventing ...e5, as now this advance doesn't come with tempo anymore which means the d5-pawn would be left hanging.

**13...Rfd8**

Very logical play.

**14.Be2 dxc4**

Initiating a series of exchanges.

**15.O-O Nd5!**

The exchange of a pair of knights clears the e4-square for our remaining knight.

**16.Bxc4 Nxc3 17.Qxc3 Ne4**

All going as planned!

**18.Qc2**

Until here we?ve been following the game 1/2-1/2 (30) Nisipeanu,L (2672)-Fridman,D (2633) Baden-Baden 2014.

**18...h5!?**

This move could have given Black an initiative on the kingside.

## 4. Nc3 #2

**8.cxd5**

It is tempting to defend the knight this way.

**8...O-O!?**

8...Nxd5 9.Nxd5 exd5 10.e3 O-O would lead to a similar type of position, but with 8...O-O!? we give our opponent an extra chance to go wrong.

**9.dxe6?**

This is definitely wrong.

**9...Nb6−+**

Black gains a piece.

## 4. Nc3 #3

**9.Nb3**

A logical retreat.

**9...Nxd5**

Aiming to exchange a pair of knights. Both 9...exd5 and 9...Nb6 are good as well.

**10.Nxd5 exd5 11.e3 Nb6**

Attacking the queen and preparing to develop the c8-bishop.

**12.Qa5 Be7∞**

With good play for Black because of our active pieces. While White still has to evacuate the king from the centre we can continue with ...Nc4 or ...Bf6.

## 4. e3 #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 e6 3.c4 c5 4.e3**

White avoids the Benoni, and just wants to get a normal game by developing the pieces.

**4...d5**

We reach a symmetrical position. I was considering also to suggest 4...cxd4 5.exd4 and then 5...d5, entering the Panov Attack. However, the resulting positions seem a bit passive to me. Instead, the text move is very natural. We are just fighting for the centre.

**5.Nc3**

White is not yet defining the pawn structure.

**5...a6**

This is a useful move. Our plan is to take ...dxc4 and follow up with ...b5. We also avoid an unpleasant check on b5. 5...dxc4 6.Bxc4 a6 is interesting as well, when the game enters a Queen's Gambit Accepted where White played has played a quick Nc3 which should favour Black.

**6.cxd5 exd5**

We?ve managed to avoid the check on b5 at the expense of a tempo.

**7.Be2 cxd4!?**

By going for the exchange right now we get an improved version in case White replies exd4. That being said, in most of the games that reached this position Black played 7...Nc6 first.

**8.Nxd4**

White decides to play against the isolani.

**8...Nc6**

This looks good now. I prefer this to 8...Bd6 because in that case White could play 9.b3 and fianchetto the bishop to b2. After 8...Nc6 this would run into ...Bb4, ...Ne4 and ...Qa5.

**9.O-O Bd6**

This is generally the best square for the bishop in this variation.

**10.Nxc6**

This exchange is too early, as we can go for a quick ...Qe7 followed by ...Qe5.

**10...bxc6 11.b3 h5!**

A fine point: We're threatening ...Bxh2+. That's why it's important that we haven't castled yet.

**12.h3 Qe7 13.Qd3 O-O!**

Not an easy move to make. When you?ve got such an attack going it's difficult to switch to normal chess!

**14.Bb2 Re8⩱**

Black is already better.

## 4. e3 #2

**5.cxd5 exd5**

In return for the isolated pawn we get good control in the centre.

**6.Bb5+**

This is White?s most testing move.

**6...Nc6**

I've analysed this position for a long time, and looked for the best alternatives for Black. Every reply has its pros and cons, but developing the knight to c6 looks like the most natural move to me.

**7.O-O**

This is best, and also the most flexible.

**7...cxd4**

I prefer to clarify the pawn structure early on. 7...Bd6 is an alternative, however.

**8.Nxd4**

This is the more ambitious continuation. White gives us an isolated pawn.

**8...Bd7**

We address the pin. 8...Qc7 deserves attention as well.

**9.b3**

White keeps the option open of developing the knight to d2.

**9...Bd6**

The bishop is best placed on d6.

**10.Bb2 O-O 11.Be2 Re8**

The rook belongs on e8. 11...Qe7 is another idea.

**12.Nd2 a6**

This is a position I have played with both colours. The result was the same in both games: White won. However, in both games Black was also doing more than fine!

**13.Rc1 Nxd4**

A good exchange because we can harass the rook on c1 afterwards.

**14.Bxd4 Ba3**

The point. We want to force White?s rook away from the c-file.

**15.Ra1 Rc8**

It?s nice to establish control over this file.

**16.Bd3 Qe7⩱**

With ...Ne4 to follow. Black is more active, although I managed to lose in 1-0 (34) Nisipeanu,L (2674)-Parligras,M (2645) Bucharest rapid 2018.

## 4. g3 #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 e6 3.c4 c5 4.g3**

White avoids the Benoni and goes for an English Opening setup. The plan is to develop with Bg2, putting pressure on the long diagonal.

**4...cxd4**

We have to act fast before White has time to comfortably establish the ideal setup.

**5.Nxd4 d5**

I like this natural move. We simply fight for the centre. Of course 6.cxd5 is not good because we can take back with the queen 6...Qxd5.

However, Black also has other options on move five. For example, I've played many games with 5...Qc7, going for the c4-pawn. In that case White usually continues 6.Nc3 a6 7.Bg2 Qxc4 8.O-O with a long-lasting initiative in return for the pawn.

**6.Bg2 e5**

This is a good moment to push the pawns in the centre. This allows us to gain space and we'll be able to develop our pieces to good squares.

**7.Nc2**

This looks like a strange place to put the knight.

**7...d4**

We keep the centre intact.

**8.O-O Nc6 9.b4**

White ignores the centre for now and goes for counterplay on the queenside.

**9...Be7⩱**

We ignore White's threats. If 10.b5 we can answer 10...Na5. The nice centre gives Black a good position.

## 4. g3 #2

**7.Nf3 d4 8.O-O**

This is White's main move. 8.e3 Nc6 would just transpose after 9.O-O.

A trick to be aware of is that 8.Nxe5?? is not possible because of 8...Qa5+ winning the knight.

**8...Nc6 9.e3**

This is the best. White tries to break up Black's centre.

**9...Be7 10.exd4 exd4 11.Bf4 Be6!?**

Developing the bishop to a nice position, with the idea to meet 12.Ne5 with 12...Rc8.

11...O-O is the most played move, and Black is fine there as well.

**12.Ne5**

This has to be the most critical.

**12...Rc8**

This is the idea behind 11? Be6 ? the rook can come to c8, defending the knight on c6.

**13.Nxc6**

This exchange favours us.

**13...bxc6 14.Be5**

White was counting on this move.

**14...c5**

It would be a pity if we didn?t make this move, even if we now have to sacrifice an exchange.

**15.Bb7 Bxc4**

A simple calculation shows that 16.Qa4+ is parried by 16...Qd7, while 16.Bxc8 is met with 16...Bxf1.

**16.Re1 O-O**

Bringing the king to safety.

**17.Bxc8**

Sooner or later White has to take the exchange.

**17...Qxc8 18.Bxf6**

This is a more cautious way to play than 18.Bxd4.

**18...Bxf6 19.Nd2 Be6**

In order to bring the rook to the d-file and push the c- and d-pawns.

**20.Ne4 Rd8**

With nice compensation for the exchange. We can push the central pawns, and also the white king is insecure.

20...Be7 is also possible, but after 21.Rc1 Qa8 it's not so straightforward.

## Trompowsky

**1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5**

The Trompowsky Attack. White intends to exchange the bishop for the knight and then take advantage of the superior pawn structure, or just to develop normally and claim that the pin on the f6-knight is annoying for Black.

**2...e6**

Of course, there are many good replies at this juncture. I chose 2...e6 because I have experience with it, and also because it fits our repertoire's move order which can transpose from the 2.Nf3 e6 3.Bg5 lines.

The idea behind 2...e6 is to not allow White to double our pawns, while we are preparing ...h6. 2...c5, 2...d5 or 2...Ne4 are all options which can be recommended as well.

**3.e4**

White takes the centre, and is ready to part with his dark-squared bishop.

**3...h6**

We force White to give up the bishop. Exchanging pieces is good for us because we lack some space.

**4.Bxf6 Qxf6 5.Nc3**

Usually, after this White?s plan is to continue with Qd2, O-O-O and then push on the kingside.

**5...d6**

This keeps the fight complicated. It is also a flexible move, which can help us with the move orders. 5...Bb4 is a worthy alternative.

**6.Nf3**

This indicates that White is no longer going for the aggressive f4 plan.

**6...g6!?**

This move order allows us a more aggressive setup. The bishop belongs on g7. 6...Nd7 is played more often here.

**7.Qd2 Bg7 8.O-O-O Qe7**

In order to prevent White from playing e5 with tempo at some point.

**9.h4 a6**

We can already start our counterplay on the queenside.

**10.e5 Nd7**

We shouldn't forget about development!

**11.Qe3 b5**

Now is the right time to start pushing.

**12.Bd3 Bb7**

Black is already better.

**13.Kb1 dxe5**

In order to open up the diagonal of our dark-squared bishop.

**14.Nxe5 c5!**

Very strong. White cannot support his e5-knight.

**15.Nxb5**

A desperate attempt.

**15...O-O!**

Naturally Black doesn't take the knight. Now White's position is falling apart. Black soon won in 0-1 (20) Lafuente,P (2555) -Lupulescu,C (2638) Sarajevo 2011.

## Benoni: 6. e4, 7. Nf3 #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5**

Black immediately fights for the centre, but allows White to push d5.

**3.d5 e6**

Black is challenging White's centre.

**4.Nc3 exd5**

We're exchanging on d5 straight away. Otherwise White can play e4 and then retake on d5 with the e-pawn, resulting in a symmetrical position where Black is slightly worse because of his lack of space.

**5.cxd5 d6**

We prevent White's d5-d6 and prepare to fianchetto our dark-squared bishop with ...g6. This is the starting position of the Benoni.

**6.e4 g6 7.Nf3 a6**

I recommend this move as White cannot parry both ...b5 and ...Bg4. Thus we manage to solve some of Black?s strategical problems in the position.

**8.a4**

Many players would go for this instantly, as they wouldn't like to allow ...b5. However, I think White has more interesting choices, but for that he must delve deep into the position.

**8...Bg4**

Black should go for this move if the move order allows it.

**9.Qb3**

This is a risky move as it allows us to double White?s pawns on the kingside. White realizes that his move order has allowed us to exchange the light-squared bishop, and goes for this last moment resource.

**9...Bxf3 10.Qxb7 Nbd7**

This is the point. Instead, 10...Bxg2 wins back the pawn, but helps White to develop his pieces.

**11.gxf3 Bg7 12.Qc6 O-O**

There is no time for us to defend the d6-pawn.

**13.Qxd6 Nh5!**

With the idea ...Be5 in order to take control over the dark squares.

**14.Bh3? f5−+**

This wins for Black as we have the hidden threat ...Rf6.

## Benoni: 6. e4, 7. Nf3 #2

**14.f4**

A logical move as it parries ...Be5, and if 14...f5? there is 15.e5.

**14...Re8**

Black activates his rook and he also has the idea to take on c3 and then on e4. Both 14...Qa5!? and 14...Ra7 are good alternatives.

**15.Bg2**

White defends the e4-pawn.

**15...Ra7**

This defends the knight on d7 so that we can jump ...Qh4 and also threatens to catch the white queen with 16...Bf8 17.Qc6 Nb8.<addx start="16...Bf8"/>

**16.a5 Qh4**

With the idea of ...Rc8 and ...Bf8 in order to trap the queen in the middle of the board. Quite a unique situation!

## Benoni: 6. e4, 7. Nf3 #3

**9.Be2 Bxf3**

I prefer to exchange the bishop right away, so as to avoid Nd2-c4. However, it is also possible to play 9...Bg7, as this would transpose to the variation 8.Be2 Bg7 9.a4! Bg4 which is covered in the main course.

**10.Bxf3 Nbd7**

This move order is aimed against any e5 break.

The move 10...Bg7 was played in the game Fedoseev - Livaic, which is analyzed in the model games chapter in the main course.

**11.O-O Bg7**

By exchanging our light-squared bishop we have managed to develop our pieces, establish control over the e5 square and prevent White from pushing e5. On the other hand, White now has the bishop pair and his e4-pawn is safely defended. White may consider Be2 in the future to prevent us from playing the ...b5 break.

**12.Bf4 Qe7**

The queen is slightly better positioned here than on c7, as we may have ideas to play ...Ne8-c7 later on.

**13.a5 O-O**

There is no reason to delay this move.

**14.Qd2**

White keeps ideas to play Be2 immediately, without first playing Rfe1.

**14...Rfb8**

Of course, the natural moves 14...Rfe8 and 14...Rab8 are also good. The point of 14...Rfb8 this is that after 15...b5 16.axb6 the a6-pawn is well defended. Additionally, after White plays Bg5 we sometimes have the extra option of playing ...Qf8. We have to be careful about White's e5, especially since the a8-rook is on the same diagonal as the f3-bishop.<addx start="15...b5"/>

**15.Rfe1**

Now we need to be careful about the e5-advance.

**15...Ne5**

The best way to prevent e4-e5 is to put a knight on the e5-square.

**16.Be2 b5 17.axb6 Rxb6∞**

Black has a pleasant position. He has various plans: he can play ...Rb4 and ...a5, or ...Rab8 to attack the b2-pawn.

## Benoni: 6. e4, 7. h3 #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.e4 g6 7.h3 Bg7 8.Nf3 O-O 9.Bd3**

This is one of the best setups for White against the Benoni. White doesn't allow us to play ...Bg4 and exchange our light-squared bishop. Given time White can castle, play Re1, Bf4, a4 and achieve a very harmonious position.

**9...b5**

Objectively this is the best move. The temporary pawn sacrifice is justified because White has wasted time by playing h3.

9...Re8 is a line suggested by John Doknjas in The Modern Benoni, which I considered and analyzed as well. However, objectively this is not so strong. I might add it as an alternative line in a future update.

**10.Nxb5**

This is the more ambitious move; although the exchange of Black?s b-pawn for White?s e-pawn favours Black, White will try to make the best of his piece activity.

**10...Re8!**

Only like this. Now we're threatening both ...Nxe4 and ...Nxd5. The immediate 10...Nxe4 is considerably worse for Black after 11.Bxe4 Re8 12.Ng5.

**11.O-O**

This is the main move. White gives up the e4-pawn but will try to make use of their piece activity to get an advantage.

**11...Nxe4**

We take back the pawn.

**12.Re1 a6**

As usual, we force the knight away from its active square. Retreating the knight with 12...Nf6 would be more passive.

**13.Na3**

The knight is heading to c4.

**13...Nf6**

Unfortunately it isn?t possible to keep the knight in the centre.

**14.Rxe8+ Nxe8**

This is the right capture, as we need to have the d6-pawn defended.

**15.Nc4 Bb7**

We're already eyeing the d5-pawn.

**16.Bf4 Bxd5**

This move can also be delayed. However, it's a good move which leads to equality.

**17.Be2**

White needs to take back the pawn.

**17...Bc6**

Here our bishop is not exposed.

**18.Nxd6 Nxd6 19.Bxd6 Nd7=**

With an equal position. Black has nothing to worry due to their actively placed pieces.

## Benoni: 6. e4, 7. h3 #2

**15.Bg5**

White is developing with tempo.

**15...Qc7**

This is the most common move in this position, though Black has also tried 15...Bf6.

**16.Qa4 Nf6**

This is more flexible than 16...Nd7. Now in case of 17.Re1 we can reply 17...Bb7.

**17.Nb5 Qd7**

I prefer this move to 17...Qb6 as we keep our queen closer to the kingside, thus avoiding a possible attack on the king.

**18.Bxf6 Bxf6 19.Re1**

The threat is Qf4.

**19...Kg7**

We?ve prevented White's threat and we're ready to continue ?Bb7.

**20.Qa3 Qd8**

A fine nuance. The point of this move is to have ...Nd7 available when the white knight goes back.

**21.Nc3 Nd7**

It's more important to develop the knight first.

**22.Ne4 Be7∞**

Followed by ...Nf6 with a fine position for Black. White has no direct threats and we can bring our pieces into play. It is also possible to give up the bishop and play 22...Rb8 23.Nxf6 Nxf6 24.Qc3 Kg8 with an equal position.

## Benoni: 6. e4, 7. f4 #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.e4 g6 7.f4**

This is the most aggressive approach against the Benoni. It is also quite justified. White is rolling forward his central pawns, trying to create threats as soon as possible. He will play in the centre and on the kingside.

This line is quite dangerous for Black. That's why many players avoid it by playing the Benoni only after White has committed the knight to f3, e.g. 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 c5. That way White cannot play the 7. f4 line. However, if White continues 3.Nc3 with 3...c5 Black doesn?t avoid the f4 line, while after 3...Bb4 he enters the Nimzo-Indian, and 3...d5 is the Queen's Gambit Declined.

I don't think many white players are well prepared in the f4 line since Black can avoid it in several ways. So, if we're up for a challenge and want to play for a win, we should allow White to choose whatever setup he wants in our favourite opening!

**7...Bg7**

We're one step from castling, but not quite there!

**8.e5**

This is called the Mikenas Attack, after the Lithuanian International Master Vladas Mikenas. It's an aggressive line, but Black has good resources.

**8...Nfd7**

I prefer this although 8...dxe5 is possible as well.

**9.Nb5**

This is actually the point of White's early e5. Black will be deprived of the right to castle. 9.Ne4 dxe5 leads to the same position after 10.Nd6+.

**9...dxe5 10.Nd6+ Ke7**

It's better to get rid of the knight immediately.

**11.Nxc8+ Qxc8 12.Nf3 Rd8**

Black?s aim is to attack the d5-pawn quickly after ...Nb6. 12...Re8 is played more often and is also a good move.

**13.fxe5 Nxe5 14.Bg5+**

A tempting check.

**14...Kf8!**

A very strong exchange sacrifice.

**15.Bxd8 Qxd8⩱**

This position was first seen in 0-1 (50) Grandelius,N (2570)-Hedman,E (2381) Falun 2012, which I've analyzed in the model games section in the main course. Black's position is fun to play! White?s king is stuck in the centre, especially if Black plays ...Nxf3+ followed by ...Bd4. White's rooks can?t be activated and we can quickly bring our forces towards the white king with ...Nd7, ...Qb6/...a5(+) and ...Re8.

## Benoni: 6. e4, 7. f4 #2

**8.Bb5+!**

An important check. White is hindering our normal development. This is called the Taimanov Variation or Taimanov Attack. It was analyzed by Mark Taimanov in 1956 and played in 1957 against Trifunovic (according to my database). The line became very popular in the early 1980s when Kasparov played it with White.

**8...Nfd7**

This is the only good reply. Both 8...Bd7 9.e5 and 8...Nbd7 9.e5 give White an advantage after some forcing lines. However, after 8...Nfd7 our knight is slightly misplaced on d7, and in some lines we may have to bring it back to f6. Another important point is that for the moment we cannot play ...Bg4.

With the knight on d7 we do get some additional options: we can develop the other knight to a6 and from there to b4 or c7, or we can even play ...Nb6.

**9.Be2**

This is a tricky move. Apparently the bishop is less active than on d3, as from e2 it doesn't defend the e4-pawn. However, with our knight on d7 the e4-pawn is not really under attack, and there is a more subtle nuance: after 9...O-O 10.Nf3 there is no 10...Nf6 as White can push 11.e5 since his d5-pawn is defended.

**9...Qh4+**

This loses a tempo but slightly weakens White's kingside. After we move the knight from d7 we'll be able to exchange our light-squared bishop. 9...O-O is seen more often.

**10.g3 Qd8**

I prefer the queen here, as although it seems a bit more active on e7 she is often exposed after an eventual sequence of e5, ...dxe5 d6.

**11.Nf3 O-O 12.O-O Na6!?**

Since 12...Nf6 doesn't work in view of 13.e5, Black needs to develop the knight to c7 via a6.

12...Re8 is a useful move, but afterwards Black still needs to go ...Na6. That's why I prefer to play ...Na6 directly and try to bring the knight to c7 faster.

**13.Kg2**

This can be a useful move for White, removing the king from the g1-a7 diagonal, but also from the motif ...Ne5-Nxf3+ in case White plays f5.

**13...Nc7**

We bring the knight towards the centre.

**14.Re1 Rb8**

Preparing ...b5.

**15.a4 a6**

Now it's time to start counterplay on the queenside. This is possible because White's play has been slow.

**16.a5 b5 17.axb6 Nxb6∞**

Black has many ideas: ...Re8, ...Nb5 or even ...Bg4. ...Bd7-b5 is also sometimes possible, but it's a bit slow here.

## Benoni: 6. e4, 7. f4 #3

**9.Bd3**

White retreats the bishop to an active square and prevents the expansion with ...a6 and ...b5.

**9...O-O**

I prefer this to the other main move 9...Qh4+.

**10.Nf3 Nf6!?**

This move is possible because after 11.e5 the d5-pawn is hanging, as the bishop on d3 prevents White's queen from controlling the d5-square. Yes, Black loses a tempo, but now we want to get rid of our light-squared bishop with ...Bg4.

I have deeply analyzed this position, and I also considered the interesting possibility 10...Qa5 11.Bd2 Re8. However, 10...Nf6 is more natural and gives us a typical Benoni position.

**11.O-O Bg4**

We exchange the light-squared bishop according to plan.

**12.h3 Bxf3 13.Qxf3 Nbd7**

Thus Black manages to complete his development. 13...a6 is also possible, but probably it will just transpose back to 13...Nbd7.

**14.Bd2 a6 15.a4 c4!**

This works because the white king is still on g1!

**16.Bxc4 Qb6+ 17.Rf2 Qxb2**

Black?s queen will not get trapped and is rather active.

**18.Rb1 Qa3**

The only move.

**19.Rxb7 Rfc8∞**

With active play down the c-file, while the c4-bishop and c3-knight are loosely positioned.

## Benoni: 6. e4, 7. f4 #4

**9.Nf3**

White continues with normal development. He will go for a quick kingside attack. White's next moves are likely to be O-O, Bd3, f5 and Qe1-g3.

**9...a6**

Of course, we need to take the opportunity to expand on the queenside.

**10.Bd3**

The most natural square for the bishop.

**10...b5 11.O-O O-O 12.f5**

This is too rushed a decision.

**12...Ne5!**

By exchanging the f3-knight we get good control over the e5-square.

**13.Nxe5 Bxe5 14.Bf4 Bxf4!?**

The white rook on f4 is not well placed.

**15.Rxf4 Nd7 16.Qd2 Ne5**

It feels great to have such a strong knight! 16...f6 is also possible if you don't want to allow a white pawn there.

**17.f6**

White?s last chance to play this!

**17...Kh8 18.Raf1 g5!**

We can play around the f6-pawn. Black is slightly better.

## Benoni: 6. Nf3, 7. Nd2 #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.Nf3 g6 7.Nd2**

This is quite a strong plan. White avoids the exchange of the light-squared bishop with ...Bg4 and prepares e4. The knight will defend the e4-pawn, and at the right moment wants to jump to the ideal square c4.

**7...Bg7 8.e4 O-O 9.Be2 Na6**

I recommend this move to bring the knight to c7, rook to e8 and then ...b6 and ...Ba6. The knight on c7 will help prepare ...b5, but it's not so good against White?s advance e5. However, White loses some time with his knight maneuver so we can afford this.

We can also start with 9...Re8 and I think this should lead to the same thing.

**10.O-O Nc7**

10...Re8 should lead to the same thing, as ...Nc7 is next. Only if White goes 11.a4 we get the extra option to jump ...Nb4, although I'm not sure that this is good for us.

**11.a4**

A useful and flexible move. White could make other moves, but a4 will be needed anyway. Moreover it prevents Black?s direct ideas to prepare ...b5 by means of ...a6 and ...Rb8 because White can follow up with Nc4.

**11...Re8**

After thoroughly analyzing the position I think this is best. Black activates the rook and puts pressure on the e4-pawn. In order to play Nc4 White will have to play f3, thus clarifying his structure. 11...b6 looks interesting but then White has 12.h3

(or even 12.Re1 directly)

12...Re8 13.Re1 with a slight edge.

**12.f3**

This is the main move and it makes sense to securely defend the e4-pawn. White prepares to continue with Nc4 and Bf4.

**12...b6**

There is no time for ...a6, ...Rb8 and ...b5, as we need to stop the Nc4 plan. Thus the point is to play ...Ba6 after Nc4 and exchange our bishop for the knight on c4. If White delays Nc4, we can first play the useful move ...Rb8.

**13.Nc4 Ba6**

The only move. We need to keep an eye on the c4-knight.

**14.Bg5 Qd7!?**

We avoid the pin and prepare to push ...b5 after ...Bxc4 and ...a6. There is no need to play ...h6 yet, so as not to weaken our king?s position.

**15.Qd2 Bxc4**

This is forced as White was threatening b3.

**16.Bxc4 a6**

Preparing ...b5.

**17.Rfe1**

Making space for the bishop to come to f1.

**17...b5**

If possible we always go for this advance.

**18.Bf1 bxa4**

We'll make use of the b-file.

**19.Nxa4 Rab8 20.Qa5**

This was played in an older correspondence game. White?s idea is to continue Nb6 and Nc4.

**20...Qd8∞**

This prevents 21.Nb6, which can now be answered by 21...Ncxd5 or even 21...Ng4 if we are looking for a perpetual. We've got a playable position. We can go ...h6 next to get rid of the pin on the f6-knight.

## Benoni: 6. Nf3, 7. Nd2 #2

**17.Qd3**

White is not making it easy for us to get in ...b5.

**17...Nh5**

A provocative move with the idea to prepare ...f5. 17...h6 is playable as well.

**18.g4**

Both a weakening and an ambitious move.

**18...h6!**

It's good to include this before retreating the knight, because currently White doesn't have the option to retreat the bishop to f4.

**19.Bxh6**

White tries to win a pawn.

**19...Bxh6 20.gxh5 b5!**

Just the right moment to start counterplay.

**21.axb5 axb5 22.Nxb5 Rxa1**

We can include this exchange, although it is also possible to go 22...Bf4 immediately.

**23.Rxa1 Bf4∞**

The white king does not feel so safe any more.

**24.Ra7?**

While it looks like this wins a piece, this move actually loses on the spot. But Black is fine in any case.

**24...Qh3−+**

Followed by a decisive attack. The c7-knight is not important.

## Benoni: 6. Nf3, 7. Nd2 #3

**7...Bg7 8.Nc4**

It makes sense to bring the knight here and put pressure on the d6-pawn. However, White has delayed his development, and the e4-square is not so well defended.

**8...O-O 9.Bf4 Nbd7!?**

There is nothing wrong with defending the pawn with 9...Ne8, as seen for example in the game Moiseenko - Lupulescu, which is analyzed in the model game section in the main course. However, I think that is not necessary. I prefer to sacrifice a pawn and fight for the initiative.

**10.Bxd6?!**

This is tempting because it takes a pawn and attacks the rook. However, our rook will be well placed on e8, and after a future ...Nb6 the d5-pawn will be exposed.

**10...Re8 11.e3 Nb6**

This is the point.

**12.Bg3 Nbxd5**

We take back the pawn.

**13.Nd6?**

This move is way too optimistic.

**13...Nxc3 14.bxc3**

This was played in 0-1 (25) Kopylov,M (2408)-Parligras,M (2591) Chess.com INT 2020.

**14...Be6!**

Would have been very strong.

**15.Nxe8 Qxe8−+**

White is not in time to defend. For example 16.Be2 Ne4 17.O-O Nxc3 18.Qc2 b5! and the black pawns are rolling forward. Black is winning. The white bishop has no other squares (as after 16.Bd3 Rd8 the pin on the d-file is very problematic for him) so he has to give up material in order to complete his development.

## Fianchetto Variation #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.Nf3 g6 7.g3**

The Fianchetto Variation is a solid line for White. White intends to slowly build up his position. It is an important line since it can also be reached via the move order 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 c5 4.d5 exd5 5.cxd5 d6. Thus Black players who don?t want to play the Catalan when White plays 3. g3 often go for this specific variation in the Benoni.

**7...Bg7 8.Bg2 O-O 9.O-O**

White's plan is to bring the bishop to f4 before or after playing Nd2. h3 is a useful move as it takes away the g4-square for Black. White will play a4 as a response to a6. Usually White doesn't go for e2-e4 quickly, instead preparing it with moves like Re1.

**9...Re8**

This is the starting position of the Fianchetto Variation. The rook is well placed on e8, and White already has to take into account the move ...Ne4, since it is often quite useful for Black to exchange a pair of knights. Also, after White's Nd2-c4 we need to be ready to play Nd7-e5 or Nd7-b6 in order to challenge White's knight. Therefore Black's b8-knight has to go to d7. It is too slow to instead develop it with ...Na6-c7.

It is always a question when to include the moves ...a6 and a4. For the time being, I prefer to be flexible and not include them yet. On the one hand, having White?s pawn on a4 is good for us if we swap the knights on e4 since we can then have a stable square on b4 for our rook. However, in other lines, having the pawn on a4 gives White the additional option of playing a5 with a grip on the queenside.

**10.Bf4**

A popular move. White finishes his development and keeps an eye on the d6-pawn.

**10...h6!?**

An interesting and double-edged continuation. We want to expand on the kingside by dislodging the bishop from f4. This may be a risky plan since we weaken the kingside, but I think it's a good line if you want to play for a win.

**11.Qc1 g5**

Of course, we continue with our plan.

**12.Bd2**

This move has been played the most in this position.

**12...Bf5**

We develop the bishop to this nice square. The kingside doesn't feel so weakened because we have 3 minor pieces defending the king.

**13.h4 g4 14.Ne1**

White can bring the knight into play with Nc2-e3 or Nd3-f4.

**14...Kh7**

In this position this is preferable to 14...h5, as we don't weaken the position too much.

**15.Nc2 Bg6**

This is slightly more precise, as the direct 15...Nbd7 may allow 16.Bf4.

**16.Ne3 Nbd7 17.h5!?**

White exchanges their h-pawn for our g-pawn.

**17...Nxh5 18.Nxg4 f5**

A tempting move. We're going for an attack on White?s king.

**19.Nh2 Ne5**

The knight is well placed on e5.

**20.Bf4**

This move was tried in 0-1 (34) Anand,N (2394)-Kotronias,V (2505) Divcibare 2018.

**20...Nxf4**

In the aforementioned game Black started with 20...b5, but it was better to take the bishop first.

**21.gxf4 Ng4⩱**

White's king is not safe.

## Fianchetto Variation #2

**13.h4 g4 14.Nh2 h5**

I prefer this over 14...Kh7, since after the latter move White can break with 15.f3.

**15.Bg5 Nbd7 16.Qf4**

This double attack is rather dubious. Over the board you realize you cannot go for this with the knight still on h2.

**16...Bg6 17.Qxd6?! Re5!**

Very strong. The queen is trapped and Black intends ...Qc8 and ...Ne8 to capture her majesty.

**18.f4**

This was played in 0-1 (41) Lei,T (2467)-L'Ami,E (2605) Wijk aan Zee 2017.

**18...Rf5!**

This is even stronger than the game continuation 18...Rxg5. The idea of 18...Rf5 is to trap the white queen with ...Bf8. However, the exchange sacrifice on g5 is also quite good.

**19.e4 Bf8**

Winning the queen.

**20.Qxd7 Qxd7 21.exf5 Qxf5∓**

With a large advantage for Black.

## Benoni: 6. Nf3, 7. Bf4 #1

**1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.Nf3 g6 7.Bf4 a6**

7...Bg7 is covered in the course as well as a sharper alternative.

**8.e4**

White allows ...b5 but goes for quick play in the centre. With the bishop on f4, White usually chooses a set-up with h3 and e3 (after he has prevented ...b5 with a4 - as in the next chapter), but we need to be prepared for the rare 8. e4 too.

**8...b5**

Of course, we take the opportunity to expand on the queenside, also avoiding an unpleasant check with Qa4+.

**9.Qe2**

White is preparing the e5 break with all his forces.

**9...Be7**

By simply developing the bishop to e7 we prevent the e5 push. Next we can castle, play ...Re8 and ...Bf8. 9...Ra7!? also deserves attention, but 9...Bg7? falls into White's hands after 10.Bxd6! Qxd6 11.e5 Qe7 12.d6.

**10.Qc2**

White's best strategy is to return to normal play. He can then claim that the bishop on e7 is misplaced. That is only partly true, because we just lose one tempo to put it back to f8 after ...O-O and ...Re8. Besides, we have already managed to play ...b5, which is a move that White usually wants to prevent.

**10...O-O 11.a4**

White is well advised to try to undermine Black's pawns on the queenside.

**11...b4**

This comes with tempo and keeps the pawn structure intact.

**12.Nb1**

Here White intends to reroute the knight to c4, which is the ideal square for the knight.

**12...b3!**

We need to act quickly, making use of White's lack of development.

**13.Qd3 Re8**

With the threat of ...Nxe4.

**14.Nc3 Nh5**

A double purpose move: we chase away White's dark-squared bishop from the h2-b8 diagonal, while at the same time making space for our bishop to move onto the long a1-h8 diagonal.

**15.Be3 Bf6**

Continuing with our plan.

**16.Be2 Nd7**

Of course 16...Bg4 is also an option, but the exchange of our light-squared bishop is not so important here as we have enough space on the queenside.

**17.O-O Rb8∞**

The b3-pawn is more of a strength than a weakness while the b4-square is available for our rook.

## Benoni: 6. Nf3, 7. Bf4 #2

**8.a4**

White prevents ...b5 and later on a5 can be played, in order to make use of the b6-square.

**8...Bg7 9.e3?!**

This is a mistake, one that can easily be made by a careless player.

**9...Bg4!**

I cannot stress enough the importance of this move! Once the opportunity arises we should exchange our light-squared bishop on f3.

**10.Be2 Bxf3**

We can swap the bishop right away. However, 10...O-O is also good.

**11.Bxf3 Qe7!?**

In order to be able to play ...Nbd7 faster. However, again 11...O-O is just as strong.

**12.Qb3**

White tries to put some pressure on the b7-pawn.

**12...O-O 13.O-O Nbd7!?**

I?m giving this line just to show that we can sacrifice the b7-pawn if necessary.

**14.Qxb7 Rfb8 15.Qc6 Ne8**

Almost trapping the queen.

**16.a5**

Until now we've been following the game 1-0 (33) Gajewski,G (2634)-Rupprecht,A (2401) Germany 2013.

**16...Ra7**

This move allows us to move the b8-rook.

**17.Rab1 Ne5 18.Bxe5 Bxe5**

The pawn minus is not really felt. We have nice pressure on the b-file.

## Benoni: 6. Nf3, 7. Bf4 #3

**8...Bg7 9.h3**

Both preventing ...Bg4 and creating a refuge for the bishop on h2.

**9...O-O 10.e3**

This is the point. On e4 the pawn would have been a target. By playing e3, White can first finish their development and only then prepare the advance of the e-pawn.

**10...Ne8**

In this position Black has tried many different plans. With 10...Ne8 we defend the d6-pawn and prepare ...Nd7. Also in some lines, because the d6-pawn is protected, we can forego having to play ...Qe7.

If Black plays 10...b6 immediately then White can reply 11.Nd2 Ne8 12.Nc4 with pressure on d6.

**11.Be2 b6!?**

Black prevents a5 and prepares ...Nd7-e5. After the knights are exchanged on e5 the c5-pawn will be defended by the b6-pawn, which favours us.

11...Nd7 is possible as well, but White can then reply 12.a5, thus transposing to the lines after 11. a5.

**12.O-O**

The rare continuation 12.e4 features in the main course in the model game Nyback - Papaioannou.

**12...Nd7 13.Nd2**

White plans to bring the knight to c4. However this loses some tempi and meanwhile we can expand on the kingside.

**13...Ne5 14.Nc4 Nxc4**

Usually in this line we try to exchange the knights.

**15.Bxc4 f5 16.Qd2 g5**

Expanding on the kingside.

**17.Bh2 Ra7∞**

It's nice to bring the rook into play from afar! Black has good play on the kingside. We could even push the h-pawn later on.
