### (438) 21. 3rd Move Alternatives - 3...d6 #1

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 d6**

This is the real Steinitz defense, but it does not really make much sense as we can grab the centre immediately.

**4.d4**

We take the opportunity to push in the centre immediately. Without the inclusion of ...a6 Ba4 Black doesn't have the option of ...b5 here, meaning that e5 is very hard to defend.

**4...Bd7 5.Bxc6**

Looks slightly surprising, but is in fact quite smart. We give the bishop pair, but gain a lot of time in return.

**5...Bxc6 6.Nc3**

Again the problem for Black is that the e5-pawn can't be defended in a good way.

**6...exd4**

6...Nf6 7.Qe2 exd4 8.Nxd4 transposes into the same line.

**7.Nxd4 Nf6 8.Qe2**

Defending e4, but also preparing O-O-O.

**8...Be7 9.Be3**

Fol@owed by O-O-O gives us a huge attack for free. The reason our attack is so strong is that we have firm control over the centre, making it very hard for Black to transfer their pieces between the kingside and queenside. Note, the pawn is tactically protected as 9...Nxe4?? loses material to 10.Nxc6 Nxc3 11.Nxd8 Nxe2 12.Nxb7 Rb8 13.Na5 Rxb2 14.Kxe2 and 9...Bxe4 is also markedly worse for Black after 10.Nxe4 Nxe4 11.Qb5+ Kf8 12.Qxb7 .

### (439) 21. 3rd Move Alternatives - 3...d6 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 d6**

**4.d4**

**4...exd4 5.Nxd4 Bd7**

This kind of play was fairly popular some 100 years ago, but to the modern eye Black has just given up the centre without getting anything at all in return.

**6.O-O**

Calmly developing.

**6...Nf6 7.Nc3 Nxd4 8.Bxd7+ Qxd7 9.Qxd4**

Does not change much. Theoretically the trade of two sets of pieces makes our space advantage less valuable, but it is still there and Black has no way of ever breaking free. Just developing our pieces and grabbing more space should increase our advantage in the long run.

### (440) 21. 3rd Move Alternatives - 3...d6 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 d6**

**4.d4**

**4...exd4 5.Nxd4 Bd7**

**6.O-O**

**6...Nf6 7.Nc3 Be7 8.Nxc6**

A simple solution. Keeping the tension is also possible and definitely better for White, but I like to clarify our structural advantage immediately.

**8...bxc6 9.Bd3 O-O 10.f4**

Black has both a passive position and structural problems. Meanwhile, our kingside attack will flow very naturally with moves like Qf3, Be3 and Rae1, perhaps one day followed by the e5-break.

### (441) 21. 3rd Move Alternatives - 3...d6 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 d6**

**4.d4**

**4...exd4 5.Nxd4 Bd7**

**6.O-O**

**6...Nf6 7.Nc3 Be7 8.Nxc6**

**8...Bxc6 9.Bxc6+ bxc6 10.f4**

Grabbing more space.

**10...O-O 11.Qf3**

The position is very pleasant for us. Next, we develop our bishop to e3 or b2, bring the a1-rook into the game and then start active play on the kingside. Meanwhile Black is unable to generate any meaningful counterplay due to the lack of space.

### (34) Quickstarter Guide - Jaenisch Gambit #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

The Jaenisch Gambit. Black attacks the centre immediately and the long-term strategic idea is to trade a non-central pawn for a central one, like a Sicilian. Unlike ...c5 in the Sicilian, the move ...f5 in the Jaenisch Gambit does weaken both the a2-g8 diagonal and the 7th rank, so it is a very risky decision. It was for a long time not seen at the highest level, but some ~10 years ago Radjabov started to play it almost regularly in the top events, and it made a comeback. However, the burst of popularity seems to have gone again, as White has found some very convincing ways not only to get an edge, but also take all fun out of Black's position.

**4.d3**

Solidifying our e4-pawn.

**4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O Bc5**

Traditionally this was the mainline, but it does look pretty depressing for Black.

**7.Bxc6**

Picking up a pawn.

**7...bxc6 8.Nxe5 O-O**

For the pawn, Black has a nice bishop pair, but our position is too solid to be seriously worried about that.

**9.Nc3 d6 10.Na4**

Is the key move, forcing the trade of one of the bishops.

**10...Qe8 11.Nd3**

The c5-bishop is still trapped. Without the bishop pair Black won't have enough compensation for the pawn, although we still need to be a bit careful.

### (35) Quickstarter Guide - Jaenisch Gambit #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**4.d3**

**4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O d6 7.Bc4**

Very important. We make sure Black will never be able to castle short.

**7...Bg4 8.h3**

Useful, to have the option of breaking the pin with g4 later on, if necessary.

**8...Bh5 9.Nc3 Nd4**

9...Be7 is Sethuraman's suggestion in his Chessable course. 10.a3!? is the recommendation covered in the course. We prepare Qd3 without being hit by ...Nb4. Additionally, a3 supports a later b4 advance, which we will use to attack if Black castles long. Against 9...Qd7 , intending to castle long, 10.Nd5! O-O-O 11.Qd3 is the best setup. We have excellent central control, and can start actions on the queenside. The most natural and straightforward idea now is to push a4-a5-a6, creating very unpleasant pressure against Black's king.

**10.g4**

Looks scary at first sight but Black does not have enough development to really attack.

### (412) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...Nf6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**4.d3**

Undoubtedly the mainline nowadays. 4.Nc3 used to be most popular and is also interesting, but 4.d3 makes sure that we are always able to recapture with a pawn on e4, never giving up central control.

**4...Nf6 5.exf5**

is possible now that Black no longer has ...e4.

**5...d6**

Here many moves are very good for White, for example

**6.O-O Bxf5 7.d4**

opening up the centre long before Black's king can escape.

### (413) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O Bc5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**4.d3**

**4...fxe4**

Played by everyone.

**5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O**

Now Black has an important choice. The move Bc5 is generally the more solid choice, when Black often ends up giving up a pawn for positional compensation. Much sharper is d6, in which Black intends to castle long and go all out against our king.

**6...Bc5 7.Bxc6**

Immediately going for the pawn.

**7...bxc6 8.Nxe5 Nxe4 9.Qh5+**

wins immediately.

### (414) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O Bc5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**4.d3**

**4...fxe4**

**5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O**

**6...Bc5 7.Bxc6**

**7...bxc6 8.Nxe5 O-O**

Black has a fairly strong bishop pair and an open f-file as compensation for the missing pawn. A big advantage for us is that we lack clear weaknesses and targets for attack, which makes it very hard for Black to get some tangible for the activity.

**9.Nc3**

Protecting e4, but also getting ready to kick back the annoying c5-bishop with Na4 at an appropriate moment.

**9...Ba6 10.Nd3 Bb6**

Is another way for Black to play, but this gives us a chance to trade one of the bishops immediately.

**11.Be3**

Not necessary, but I like it. We get ugly doubled e-pawns, but all pressure against f2 disappears and with it all Black's activity.

**11...Bxe3 12.fxe3 Qe7 13.Rf4**

The rook is very well placed on f4, as Black can't ever kick it away, making the e4-pawn well protected. Next, we can play Qf3 and bring the a1-rook to f1, starting active play on our own.

### (415) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O Bc5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**4.d3**

**4...fxe4**

**5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O**

**6...Bc5 7.Bxc6**

**7...bxc6 8.Nxe5 O-O**

**9.Nc3**

**9...d6 10.Na4**

A key move! We make sure to trade off the annoying c5-bishop, at the same time keeping our extra pawn.

**10...Bb6 11.Nxc6**

leaves us with a fairly solid extra pawn.

**11...Qe8 12.Nxb6 axb6 13.Nd4 Qxe4 14.f3**

A good move, preempting any ideas of Black on the long diagonal. Next, we can either play a4 to fight for the light squares on the queenside, or simply develop with b3, Bb2, or Bd2. Black has some drawing chances for the pawn, but not more than that.

### (416) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O Bc5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**4.d3**

**4...fxe4**

**5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O**

**6...Bc5 7.Bxc6**

**7...bxc6 8.Nxe5 O-O**

**9.Nc3**

**9...d6 10.Na4**

**10...Qe8**

The most testing move, and the recommendation of Sethuraman in his Chessable course on the Jaenisch!

**11.Nd3 Nxe4**

was tried once by Radjabov against Caruana, but very uninspiring.

**12.Naxc5 Nxc5 13.Nxc5 dxc5 14.Be3**

Material equality is restored, but Black is very likely to lose one of the c-pawns. The other c-pawn on c6 restricts the c8-bishop and Black has no compensation for it.

### (417) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O Bc5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**7...bxc6 8.Nxe5 O-O**

**9.Nc3**

**9...d6 10.Na4**

**10...Qe8**

**11.Nd3 Bg4**

Gaining a tempo, although we win it back later with f3.11...Bd4 immediately is similar, although a very slightly worse version for Black after 12.c3 .

**12.Qe1 Bd4**

Provoking us to put another pawn on the same colour as our bishop.

**13.c3**

And we oblige. The most important thing is to trade off one of the bishops.

**13...Bb6 14.Nxb6 axb6 15.f3**

Kicking the bishop away, and placing our pawn on the correct colour.

**15...Be6 16.a3**

Simply saving our a2-pawn. Although Black has sacrificed a pawn, the position isn't very forcing in nature. Rather, Black is trying to demontrade positional compensation due to our weak light squares. But we don't have any clear targets for attack, and our king is very safe with so many pawns in front of it, that I struggle to believe Black can have full compensation.

**16...Bc4**

Immediately attacking our light squares.

**17.Qd1**

Next, if allowed, we want to play Re1 to step out of the c4-f1 pin. Thereafter developing with Be3, possibly followed by improving the knight to f4 or f2. But very important is to not hurry and be observant of Black's counterplay. Once we have full control, there will be ways to start our own play later on.

**17...Qg6**

Does not make too much sense, as we will get a tempo with Nf4.

**18.Re1 \***

**17...Qf7 18.Re1 Nd7**

this is the other idea Black have: trading on d3, followed by ...c5-c4 and establishing a knight on d3.

**19.Be3 c5 20.Nc1**

is an interesting antidote, intending to kick the annoying bishop away with b3 next.

**15...Be6 16.a3**

**16...Bc4**

**17.Qd1**

**17...Qf7 18.Re1 Bb3**

Sethuraman's move, trying to disturb our coordination.

**19.Qe2 Nh5 20.Be3 c5**

Black has some compensation here, as our queenside pawns are all fixed on dark squares and it's hard for us to advance on the kingside. That being said, Black struggles to create play of their own, and we can slowly improve our position.

**21.Nf2**

is one way of playing I like quite a lot. The knight is going to g4, if needed supported by a pawn on h3, after which Black will always have to take the e5-break into account. The most natural way to stop it is by Rae8, but that allows us to push a4-a5, getting rid of our a-pawn and activating our rook. All in all, we have to act with quite some patience, but there is no doubt that in the long run we are having all the chances.

### (420) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O d6 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**4.d3**

**4...fxe4**

**5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O**

**6...d6**

Black simply defends the e5-pawn, but in doing so the f8-bishop gets locked in.

**7.Bc4**

A key move. For the time being Ng5 is a threat, but the more important point is that Black will no longer be able to castle short.

**7...Bg4 8.h3**

A good inclusion, as the possibility of a later g4 is useful. Generally, we should always be hesitant about moving the pawns in front of our own king when our opponent is intending to castle on the opposite side, but in this case Black is simply too slow at creating counterplay.

**8...Bh5 9.Nc3 Nd4**

was used once by Aronian to beat Caruana, but it's highly dubious.

**10.g4**

Shows why we needed to include h3.

**10...Nxf3+ 11.Qxf3 Bg6 12.g5**

Deviating from Caruana's play. Black is simply too far behind in development to survive. Next up with can either move the queen and push f4, or march with the h-pawn to h5. Another useful idea to keep in mind is Be6-g4, especially if Black puts their knight on h5.

### (421) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O d6 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**4.d3**

**4...fxe4**

**5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O**

**6...d6**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Bg4 8.h3**

**8...Bh5 9.Nc3 Qd7**

The main move, but very ropey objectively speaking. Black is intending to castle long, but the problem is that the king is very vulnerable also on the queenside, as we can push our a- and b-pawns quickly.

**10.Nd5**

Making use of some small tactics to get our pieces where we want them.

**10...Nxe4**

does not work out well for Black.

**11.Nxe5**

The simplest, immediately regaining the pawn and winning the bishop pair in the process.

**11...Bxd1 12.Nxd7 Kxd7 13.Rxd1**

We have a significant edge with the bishop pair in an open position.

### (422) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O d6 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Bg4 8.h3**

**8...Bh5 9.Nc3 Qd7**

**10.Nd5**

**10...O-O-O 11.Qd3**

This is our setup. We move out of the pin and are now ready to push our queenside pawns. As we have such nice central control it's very difficult for Black to generate counterplay, while our own attack quickly becomes very strong.

**11...Kb8 12.a4**

Starting the attack. 12.b4 is similar and also very promising.

**12...Ne7**

Tried in a high level correspondence game.

**13.Ng5**

Getting ready for the e6-square in case Black trades on d5.

**13...Bg6 14.Qe2**

In the game White played more forcingly with 14.Nxf6 gxf6 15.Nf7 , but I believe this is a bit simpler. Next, we simply continue with our pawn march on the queenside, and Black lacks counterplay.

### (423) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O d6 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**10.Nd5**

**10...O-O-O 11.Qd3**

**11...Kb8 12.a4**

**12...Bg6**

Looks natural, but does not really solve any problems.

**13.Re1 Nxd5 14.Qxd5**

14.Bxd5 Nb4 should be avoided.

**14...Be7 15.Ra3**

is a very useful idea to remember. The rook goes to b3, after which the b7-pawn is quite hard to defend. 15.a5 a6 16.Qd3 is less forcing, and a good alternative.

**15...Nb4**

Is the only move to try to disturb our harmony, but the tactics works out in our favour.

**16.Qd2 Rhf8**

Was tried in Schakel-Reinhart, correspondence 2020, but looks very dodgy.

**17.Qxb4**

Picking up the gauntlet. Slower moves like 17.Rb3 are also promising.

**17...d5**

Black's idea.

**18.Qc3**

Deviating from the correspondence game, where the queen went to a5.

**18...dxc4 19.Nxe5 Qe6 20.Nxg6 hxg6 21.Ra1**

leaves us a pawn up for very little compensation. Our queen is simply better placed on c3 than a5. Next, we can even transfer it to g3, covering our kingside.

### (424) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O d6 #

**18...Bxa3 19.Bb5**

is a nice zwischenzug.

**19...c6 20.Nxe5 Qd6 21.bxa3 cxb5 22.Nxg6**

The tactics have ended and we are emerging with two pawns and a strong initiative after capturing b5 on the next move. If you still prefer to avoid all of these tactics, then for instance 15.a5 would be a simple alternative.

### (425) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.Dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O d6 #

**5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O**

**6...d6**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Bg4 8.h3**

**8...Bh5 9.Nc3 Be7**

Sethuraman's suggestion, as the lines with 9...Qd7 are looking too scary for Black. By blocking the e-file Black takes the sting out of our Nd5-idea, as it can now be met safely by Nxe4.

**10.a3**

An interesting move. We prepare Qd3 without being disturbed by any ...Nb4, and long-term a3 is of course useful as we are intending on pushing our queenside pawns. It looks a bit slow, but if Black is going for the O-O-O option then ...Be7 is also not a move that helps too much, especially as it takes a the e7-square for the knight. 10.g4 is the sharper option, which seems strong but also very, very messy.

**10...Qd7 11.Qd3 O-O-O 12.b4**

Is still very nice for us. One problem for Black is that the c6-knight has no good squares after b5 next.

**12...Rhf8 13.b5 Na5 14.Ba2**

Is great for us. The a5-knight can be attacked with a4 Ba3-b4, but mainly it's very difficult for Black to get fast counterplay.

**6...d6**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Bg4 8.h3**

**8...Bh5 9.Nc3 Be7**

**10.a3**

**10...Nd4**

The critical move, forcing us to play g4.

**11.g4 Nxf3+ 12.Qxf3**

This is a slightly better version of 9...Nd4 for Black, as Be7 is more useful than a3. But I still believe it to be very promising, for the same reasons as above.

**12...Bg6 13.g5**

Even 13.Qe2!? intending f3 looks promising.

**13...Nh5 14.Qg4**

Covers the g5-pawn and prepares to meet Qd7 with Be6. Black's kin will be stuck in the centre forever.

**14...Rf8 15.Ne2**

stops ...Nf4, leaving Black without counterplay.

**10...Nd4**

**11.g4 Nxf3+ 12.Qxf3**

**12...Bg6 13.g5**

**13...Nd7 14.Qg3 c6**

Getting the b6-square for the queen in case we push f4 immediately.

**15.b4**

15.f4 exf4 16.Bxf4 Qb6+ 17.Kh2 is also not a real concern for us, but as we need b4 for later anyway it makes sense to play it immediately.

**15...Qc7 16.f4 exf4 17.Bxf4**

We are doing fantastically. The pawn on g5 prevents Bf6 and can't be attacked. As soon as Black castles long we push b5, with a huge attack. I doubt Black will survive this for long.

### (432) 21. 3rd Move Alternatives - 3...Bc5 4.c3 Nge7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Bc5**

This is a rare guest in top level practice, but still seen from time to time as a surprise weapon. Black is intending ... Nd4 to trade a set of knights.

**4.c3 Nge7**

has@been played by a few world-class players, but generally only in blitz. It's similar to 3...a6 4.Ba4 Bc5 5.c3 Nge7 , but it's beneficial for Black to include a6 Ba4, as it gives the c5-bishop a nice square on a7.

**5.O-O**

Again we delay d4 not to give Black a check on b4.

**5...Bb6 6.d4 exd4 7.cxd4 d5**

This has actually been played quite a bit, but it's a fairly bad version of similar lines.

**8.exd5 Nxd5 9.Re1+ Be6 10.Bg5 Qd6 11.Nbd2**

is the typical way to proceed in such positions. The knight comes to e4 or c4, kicking the queen away after which we take on c6, settling Black with a bad doubled pawn. For instance

**11...O-O 12.Nc4 Qb4 13.a4 a6 14.Bxc6 bxc6 15.Rc1**

is close to winning for White already. The pawn on c6 is weak and the b6-bishop very passive.

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nge7**

Thi@ is known as the Cozio Defence, and is the most important deviation from the mainlines. It has also been recommended by both Erwin L'Ami and Simon Williams in their respective Chessable courses. 4.c3 d5 is the point, which is quite OK for Black. 4.O-O would not get into our mainlines, as after for example 4...g6 5.c3 a6 6.Ba4 Bg7 7.d4 exd4 8.cxd4 b5 9.Bc2 d5 we have already committed to castling, which is something we want to delay.

**4.Nc3**

A good reply. We want to push d4 next.

**4...g6**

Logical, and the recommendation of Simon Williams in his Chessable course.

**5.d4 exd4 6.Nxd4**

According to L'Ami, this leads to a pleasant edge for White. I can only agree! 6.Nd5 is sharper, but exactly the sort of thing Black hopes for when trying to be provocative with 3...Nge7.

**6...Bg7 7.Be3 O-O 8.Nxc6**

This is the line given by L'Ami. By taking on c6 already here we make it harder for Black to push ...d5.

**8...bxc6 9.Ba4**

This structure is very nice for us. Next, we can either play Qd2 and castle long, or Bd4, trading off Black's only good piece.

**9...d5**

Looks like it gives counterplay, but is very strongly met by

**10.Bc5**

Creating all sorts of unpleasant pins.

### (37) Quickstarter Guide - Cozio Defence #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nge7**

**4.Nc3**

**4...Ng6**

L'Ami's recommendation.

**5.d4**

It's possible to play more ambitiously with 5.h4 , but again I prefer to meet provocations with solid, central play.

**5...exd4 6.Nxd4 Nxd4**

L'Ami's suggestion and definitely the most solid move.

**7.Qxd4 c6 8.Be2**

8.Bc4 b5!? gets too messy for my taste.

**8...Qb6**

Trying to either trade queens to ease up on the pressure, or kick it away from d4 and develop the f8-bishop.

**9.Qd3**

Keeping the queens. We have a slight space advantage and a small, but very safe edge. Next up, we just castle and develop naturally. The push a4-a5 to force the Black queen back is often a good idea as well.

### (375) 19. Cozio & Delayed Cozio Defe - 3...Nge7 4.Nc3 g6 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

In this chapter we will have a look at systems in which Black plays ...g6 and Nge7. There are many different move orders for Black to reach that setup, so we have to be a bit careful not to get tricked into something we don't want. Most of Black's different move orders are aimed at limiting White's options, but luckily we are anyway trying to play the same setup whenever possible.

**3...Nge7**

Thi@ is known as the Cozio Defence, and is the most important deviation from the mainlines. It has also been recommended by both Erwin L'Ami and Simon Williams in their respective Chessable courses. 4.c3 d5 is the point, which is quite OK for Black. 4.O-O would not get into our mainlines, as after for example 4...g6 5.c3 a6 6.Ba4 Bg7 7.d4 exd4 8.cxd4 b5 9.Bc2 d5 we have already committed to castling, which is something we want to delay.

**4.Nc3**

Therefore we have to treat the line independently, and then 4. Nc3 is the best move. The point is to play d4 next, but first force Black to make a decision.

**4...g6**

**5.d4 exd4 6.Nxd4**

**6...Bg7 7.Be3 O-O 8.Nxc6**

Is the line given by L'Ami. By taking on c6 already here we make it harder for Black to push ...d5.

**8...Nxc6 9.Qd2**

Intending O-O-O and h4-h5. With such nice control of the centre we do not have to fear any counterattack by Black.

### (376) 19. Cozio & Delayed Cozio Defe - 3...Nge7 4.Nc3 g6 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Nge7**

**4.Nc3**

**4...g6**

**5.d4 exd4 6.Nxd4**

**6...Bg7 7.Be3 O-O 8.Nxc6**

**8...bxc6 9.Ba4 d6**

is too passive.

**10.Qd2**

followed by O-O-O gives us a dangerous attack. 10.Bd4 trading Black's only good piece is a more positional but also very strong move.

### (377) 19. Cozio & Delayed Cozio Defe - 3...Nge7 4.Nc3 g6 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Nge7**

**4.Nc3**

**4...g6**

**5.d4 exd4 6.Nxd4**

**6...Bg7 7.Be3 O-O 8.Nxc6**

**8...bxc6 9.Ba4 d5 10.Bc5**

is the tactical point. Due to the pin Black can't really do anything in the centre and is rather left with only weaknesses.

### (378) 19. Cozio & Delayed Cozio Defe - 3...Nge7 4.Nc3 d6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Nge7**

**4.Nc3**

**4...d6**

simply allows

**5.d4**

after which we have a nice edge.

**5...a6 6.Be2 exd4 7.Nxd4 Nxd4 8.Qxd4 Nc6 9.Qd3**

was Pruijssers-Trent, 2015. The fact that the game ended in a draw had more to do with Trent's great practical playing strength rather than the current position. We have a very solid space advantage and can choose to castle on either side.

### (379) 19. Cozio & Delayed Cozio Defe - 3...Nge7 4.Nc3 Ng6 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Nge7**

**4.Nc3**

**4...Ng6**

L'Ami's suggestion.

**5.d4**

**5...exd4 6.Nxd4 Bc5**

does trade an extra set of pieces, but leaves Black very passive.

**7.Be3 Bxd4 8.Bxd4 Qg5**

was actually tried in Nepomniachtchi-Carlsen, 2020, but isn't great.

**9.g3 Nxd4 10.Qxd4 Ne5 11.Be2 Nc6 12.Qc4**

Gave Nepomniachtchi a very nice edge in the game. Again, Black has no compensation for the lack of space.

### (380) 19. Cozio & Delayed Cozio Defe - 3...Nge7 4.Nc3 Ng6 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Nge7**

**4.Nc3**

**4...Ng6**

**5.d4**

**5...exd4 6.Nxd4 Nxd4**

**7.Qxd4 c6 8.Be2**

**8...Qb6**

**9.Qd3**

We should keep the queens on the board, as we have a space advantage.

**9...Be7 10.O-O O-O 11.a4**

We have a small space advantage, but the Black position is solid. a4 is a good way of increasing the pressure, as we will be able to push back Black's annoying queen from b6, after which we can continue with calm development. L'Ami believes it's playable for Black, and I believe White is slightly better. The two things don't necessarily contradict each other, but I'd just like to add that it's very playable for White as well!

**11...d6 12.a5**

I don't think we need to know any more theory here, but let's anyway have a look at some lines.

**12...Qc7 13.f4**

Increasing our space advantage.

**13...f5 14.Qc4+ Kh8 15.Nd5**

picks up the bishop pair. In the semi-open position that arises it will definitely be of some value to us.

### (381) 19. Cozio & Delayed Cozio Defe - 3...Nge7 4.Nc3 Ng6 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Nge7**

**4.Nc3**

**4...Ng6**

**5.d4**

**5...exd4 6.Nxd4 Nxd4**

**7.Qxd4 c6 8.Be2**

**8...Qb6**

**9.Qd3**

**9...Be7 10.O-O O-O 11.a4**

**11...d6 12.a5**

**12...Qc7 13.f4**

**13...Bd7 14.Be3 Rfe8 15.Qc4**

A nice way of disturbing Black's coordination a bit.

**15...Rac8**

This does not work.

**16.Bxa7**

There is no way to trap the bishop, so this is just a healthy extra pawn.

### (382) 19. Cozio & Delayed Cozio Defe - 3...Nge7 4.Nc3 Ng6 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Nge7**

**4.Nc3**

**4...Ng6**

**5.d4**

**5...exd4 6.Nxd4 Nxd4**

**7.Qxd4 c6 8.Be2**

**8...Qb6**

**9.Qd3**

**9...Be7 10.O-O O-O 11.a4**

**11...d6 12.a5**

**12...Qc7 13.f4**

**13...Bd7 14.Be3 Rfe8 15.Qc4**

**15...Qc8**

The best move, but looks a bit clumsy.

**16.Rad1 b5**

Gaining at least some sort of counterplay.

**17.axb6 axb6 18.Bxb6 Rb8 19.Be3 Rxb2**

Black wins back the pawn, but we still have an initiative.

**20.Na4**

Intending Nb6xd7, netting the bishop pair. With the queenside pawns having been traded off the bishop pair is not worth as much as before, but it is still a nice advantage to have.
