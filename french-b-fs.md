## About this Publication

The French Defence is a highly reliable response to 1 e4 which is popular at all levels. With the first two moves, Black creates a solid foundation in the centre and seeks to put pressure on White's position in the early middlegame. In this book, International Master Cyrus Lakdawala explains the basic ideas in the French and examines the important variations. The key ideas are emphasized with notes, tips and warnings and the reader's understanding is tested with frequent exercises. This book tells you everything you need to know in order to take your first steps with the French Defence.

First Steps is a new opening series and is ideal for improving players who want simple and straightforward explanations.

First Steps books are based around carefully selected instructive games which demonstrate exactly what both sides are trying to achieve. There is enough theory to enable the improving player to get to grips with the opening without feeling overwhelmed. If you want to take up a new opening, First Steps is the ideal place to start.

## Introduction

### What makes a French player?

**1.e4 e6**

The French is an opening so vast in scale, that it almost defies classification. If you enter closed games with the rapt contentment of a positional player, and if you feel agoraphobic in 1...e5 or 1...c5 situations, then you may qualify as a natural French player.

Fashionable openings go in and out of favour like ageing rock stars, who were huge 40 years ago, but now have trouble selling tickets at the local swap meet. The French isn't like this, and from my perspective, is as much fun to play at age 55 as it was to play at age 8. Now a lack of space is an issue baked into the opening. So if you love open games, the French from Black's side is probably the wrong fit for your needs. When we misplay a French we know it, since it becomes hard for our pieces to breathe, and the feeling is similar to being buried while still alive in a coffin, in Uma Thurman fashion in Kill Bill (I forgot if it's volume one or two!).

The entry of beginning level club players can feel like Gulliver, who gets tied down in Lilliputian theoretical details. My job in this book is to try and demystify an otherwise intimidating opening and make clear the various positions we may face. Even if you don't reach the exact position we cover in the book, you won't be adrift, since you will be familiar with simulacrum positions, which always come with a known antecedent, where at least you move in the right direction.

In most of the positions, the players' views tend to be irreconcilable, like space versus counterattack potential, or bishop-pair and dark squares versus superior structure. Our choices tend to exude a quality of absolutism, with no space for a fuzzy grey middle ground.

### Books versus Databases

When we face a booked-up opponent and get slaughtered, not even surviving the opening stage, we leave the game feeling like the village idiot. The skill levels required to play the French range enormously. Some lines are just much harder to handle than others.

In this era of databases and books published every week, the days of winging it in the opening are over. We must grasp our lines just to survive at the club level, but should we study from books or from databases? My advice: you don't really need a soulless database until your rating passes the 2000 Expert level.

Many of my students who are below that level prefer to study from databases which offer no explanations, rather than study from books. This is a mistake, and a bit like claiming that photography renders realistic art redundant, since the photo is so much more realistic. Maybe I'm a creature of the past, but even as an IM, I still find books infinitely more helpful than the dry savannah of databases, which offer data, but no direction. Beware, though, the difference between reading a chess book and applying the knowledge over the board is akin to reading a book on Mount Kilimanjaro and actually scaling it.

**1.--**<fen value="rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"><fend/>

The Roman statesman and scholar Pliny the Younger once advised the cure for the common cold is to kiss a mouse on both the snout and lips. Moral: that which constitutes scholarship alters with time. In our modern database era, to survive at the ruthlessly Darwinian club levels, we must survive the gauntlet of the opening stage. In this book we aren't overly concerned with the concrete and the specific.

It isn't an easy task to travel the road of innocent entry into the chess world, to the road to sophistication to the upper levels of A-Class, Expert and Master. When we first walk through the intimidating doors of our chess club, we may feel like a third grade kid, asked by a philosophy professor: "What is the origin of intelligence?" Our answer would be: "How the hell should I know? I'm just a kid in the third grade!".

The minds of many club players I know are dumpsters for partially remembered opening lines. Our goal in this book is to simply introduce key ideas and positions of the French Defence to the beginning and intermediate club player, just so you get a feel for the lines, as Black or White. We concentrate on the universal, rather than fret too much over the local, as we do for instance, in the Move by Move series. The plan here is to begin with the fuzzy generalities, avoiding a stale recycling clutter of memorized lines, and then only later get down to the unpleasant work of the study of the details to move up in the chess world. Eventually, we must further research individual lines to move upward. It was the poet Alexander Pope who warned us: "A little learning is a dangerous thing: Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian Spring."

### A Snapshot of Our Lines

Below are a few of the critical positions we may reach:

**1.--**<fen value="rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"/></fend>

The Winawer is a vast strategic web without centre, beginning or end. Soon we will probably play ...Bxc3+, where White accepts a slightly dishevelled queenside structure in return for the bishop-pair and the potential for dark-square control.

In the position, the opening feels like a bit of a contrivance, since White plays

**6...-- 7.Qg4**<fen value="rnbqk2r/pp2nppp/4p3/2ppP3/P2P4/2P5/2P2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6"/>

, bringing out the queen before the minor pieces. The gendarmes arrive in force, attacking the g7-pawn, and where we enter a predatory society of kill or be killed. We have a choice: we can castle into the teeth of White's attack or respond with

**7...Qc7**

When I was a kid, and a bully picked a fight, my strategy was to taunt my opponent and get him as angry as possible (I would imitate him in gross caricature), because I realized that an angry fighter tends to swing wildly and without accuracy. In this position Black does just that by castling.

If such provocation isn't your cup of Darjeeling, then Black can also play 7...Qc7, entering the wild Poisoned Pawn Gambit, where we give up a pawn for a development lead and open lines, and in the ensuing confusion it feels as if random, non-related events tumble and crash into each other in the middle. Be warned though, the early moves of the Poisoned Pawn Gambit are a stiffly ritualized forcing line, in many cases with little room for deviation via personal preference or whim, for either side. This line is probably the most theory dense one of the entire book, so don't enter it with the excuse: "My dog ate my homework!".<fend/>

In the position, is Black's introverted plan one of a realist or a defeatist? It's a scary feeling when we suspect our sinister opponent of manipulating us in a certain direction, yet we are unable to comprehend the purpose. Black lures White into an ambiguous world, where nothing is out in the open, and nothing is as it appears.<fen value="rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4"/>

Black's last move 4.-- Qd7 almost looks like a typo. The cunning idea is to meet

**4.-- Qd7 5.Qg4**

, with either 5...f5, protecting g7 laterally, or play the retro-developing 5...Bf8, a move which may have White questioning our sanity. The point is White's development lead can be shockingly ineffective, since Black's position remains target free. So it can sometimes feel like White fights an invisible enemy.

You may ask: "What about Black's bad light-squared bishop?". The answer: we conveniently unload it for White's powerful counterpart with the manoeuvre ...b6 and ...Ba6. White's pieces may soon remind us of those stern Easter Island statues, who just sit there and glower at Black's position, without the ability to inflict actual harm.<fend/>

In the next position we enter the Classical French, where unlike the Winawer, we are not quick to hand White dark-square control with ...Bb4 and ...Bxc3+.

**1.--**<fen value="rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"/><fend/>

In the Winawer, we pit our generalship with our opponent's in closed positions, with White's structure damaged, while we as Black are missing our important dark-squared bishop.

In the McCutcheon Variation, after 4 Bg5 Bb4, we inflict damage on White's structure and pick up White's all-important dark-squared bishop.

**1.--**<fen value="rnbqk2r/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3pP3/3Pn1Q1/2P5/P1PB1PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 1"/><fend/>

The cost? White's queen attack on g7 forces a concession of either ...g6, weakening our kingside dark squares, or ...Kf8, which forces us to renounce castling. Students tend to ask me impossible-to-answer questions like: "Which line is better: the Winawer or the Classical? This is like asking if Beethoven was a better musician than John Lennon. The answer, of course, is that the position you favour is the 'better' line.

Welcome to the Tarrasch, the safest and most solid of White's choices against the French. With<fen value="rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2"/>

**2...-- 3.Nd2**

, White denies Black any version of the ...Bb4 pins, as seen in Winawer or McCutcheon lines. Also, White gives him or herself options to build an imposing pawn centre with ideas like e5, f4 and c3.

Since White passively developed the knight to d2, this emboldens Black into an immediate central strike with

**3...c5**

When White plays exd5, Black can either recapture with the queen, made more attractive by the fact that White no longer has a Nc3 tempo-gaining option, or Black can play

**4.exd5 exd5**

taking on a future isolani on d5, which some view as a strategic burden to shoulder, while to others it represents freedom.

Why do we as Black deliberately take on a pawn weakness? The answer is freedom, which is our considerable compensation, and an unusual luxury in the French. Now this isn't simply a case of White foisting a pawn weakness upon us, since with the isolani comes a degree of central control, coupled with enhanced freedom and piece activity, the magic spell which compensates strategic deficiencies. Taking on an isolani is certainly a risk of sorts, but not that much, since we aren't signing over our mortgage with this minor structural concession.<fend/>

In the position, a sharp gambit situation arises, where the realization of one goal (initiative and attack) requires the sacrifice of another (a pawn sacrifice). Here, even Nostradamus would be hard pressed to tell us what happens next.

**1.--**<fen value="r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3q4/3B4/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 1"/><fend/>

Suspense is fun if we are reading a mystery or gothic horror novel, and not as much fun when we are sweating it out over the board with our clocks ticking away mercilessly. This line defies regulation. Black's extra pawn is no freebie, since White gets a dangerous development lead for it.

In the diagram below we see the Advance French, where we can't accurately describe Black's position as commodious lodgings. There is no way to invade another country diplomatically. Black is dispossessed of land early on, when White's e-pawn crosses the neutral zone into Black's territory.

**1.--**<fen value="rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"/><fend/>

The invading e5-pawn is yoked tightly, so Black tends to go after the weak link, d5, with a quick ...c5 break, and only later on decide if ...f6 is necessary or not.

Unsound attacks, by their nature, are contingent upon the opponent blundering, which is a reasonable supposition, since we are flawed humans, not computers. The position is the dubious (yet dangerous!) Milner-Barry Gambit, an offshoot of the Advance line.

**1.--**<fen value="r3kbnr/pp1b1ppp/1qn1p3/3pP3/3P4/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 1"/><fend/>

Now why is an unsound line dangerous? The answer is we may show up to the board unprepared and bungle the defence. When we refuse to keep up with current theory we risk being the small mom and pop store, being pushed aside by a giant corporation who just moved across the street as our competition. Education doesn't equal infallibility over the board, since even professional players go blank (I don't understand why I remember with photographic detail every character in the millions of novels I have read in my life, yet routinely go comatose in opening variations I have played for 40 years!). Our daunting job is to learn the gambit's antidote and never forget it.

Everywhere we turn, we are confronted by dreary uniformity of the two identical structures. The Exchange French can be like reading a book on the tax code as a source of poetic inspiration. If the variation were a painting, then the artist's rendering is exclusively in shades of grey. I have at some points in my career temporarily shelved the French, mainly due to my deep and abiding hatred of the Exchange line.

**1.--**<fen value="rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"/><fend/>

It's a variation generally used by lower-rated players to 'threaten' us with a draw, which to outraged French players is akin to a kind of moral blackmail. My goal in this book is to offer Black options to re-energize Black's dynamic potential, from this boring starting position.

The position doesn't have to be the cake without frosting. By castling long, that which distinguishes the two sides is suddenly given greater weight than what they originally had in common.

Many thanks to editors John Emms and Richard Palliser, and also to Nancy for proof reading, and for not deleting most of my jokes in the book.

May our French wall eternally hold firm against all barbarian aggressors.

## 1: The Main Line Winawer

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3**

This is the main line Winawer, a sanctuary of closely guarded secrets, and one of the most difficult lines to grasp in all of chess. It's impossible to declare a concrete assessment in a situation so strategically indeterminate. Both sides adhere to the nothing-ventured-nothing-gained philosophy, and the position weirdly feels like both sides pass the point of no return. The following imbalances have taken place:

1. Black traded the precious dark-squared bishop, which is a bit like a Seinfeld episode without George Costanza. On top of this, Black's remaining bishop is hemmed in by a surplus of pawns on its own colour, leading to an inability to protect the dark squares. Now the reason we swapped away such a precious piece away is told in number two on the list.

2. White's queenside pawn structure took on serious damage, with c3 and also White's a-pawn as potential chronic pawn weakness, if an ending were to occur. So often in life we are prepared to sacrifice our present happiness (Black's weakened dark squares and the imminent threat of attack), to our future happiness (Black's potential for a favourable ending), like a student who studies long, gruelling hours and voluntarily goes into debt, so that one day she graduates and lands a good job.

3. White's e5-pawn gives his or her side a central/kingside territorial advantage which means two things: a) Keeping our king safe operates as our baseline goal in many versions of the French. In this case Black's king may come under fire if he castles short, since White's e5-pawn is a natural launching pad for an attack.

b) White's centre may be chipped away with a future ...f6.

### Landa,K. - Naiditsch,A. 1: French Team Championship, 2013

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4**

Black immediately pressures the sole defender of e4.

**4.e5**

White is induced into relieving central tension. In doing so, he secures central and kingside space.

**4...c5**

NOTE: In this line be quick to challenge White's d4 point.

Later in the chapter we look at 4...Ne7

4...b6

and 4...Qd7 .

**5.Bd2**

White's idea is to play Nb5, swap off Black's good bishop and then invade d6 with his knight.

Otherwise: 5.Qg4 is another sideline, where White dispenses with a3 and immediately goes after g7: 5...Ne7 6.Qxg7?!

(6.dxc5 can be met with 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 Ng6 with a sharp game)

6...Rg8 7.Qxh7 (M.Carlsen-V.Ivanchuk, Monaco (rapid) 2011) 7...cxd4 8.a3 Qa5 is in Black's favour.

5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 gets us into the meat of the Winawer lines, which we look at next.

**5...Ne7 6.Nb5**

After 6.dxc5 Nbc6 7.Qg4 O-O 8.Nf3 f5 9.Qg3 Ng6 I already prefer Black, who can pile up on e5, R.Polzin-J.Timman, German League 1997.

**6...Bxd2+ 7.Qxd2**

NOTE: White managed to swap away our good bishop, without damage to his structure, at the high cost of losing time.

**7...O-O 8.dxc5**

Following 8.f4 a6 9.Nd6 cxd4 10.Nf3 Nbc6 11.Bd3 f6 Black gets a decent game by consistently undermining e5, E.Perelshteyn-E.Berg, Southampton 2003.

**8...Nd7**

TIP: Always be on the lookout for such a move, which double attacks both c5 and e5.

**9.Nf3**

White stands slightly worse now.

9.Qc3 is probably a better move for White: 9...f6 10.exf6 Nxf6 11.Bd3 Bd7 with a development lead for Black.

**9...Nxc5 10.Bd3 Qb6**

Targeting both b5 and b2 behind the knight.

**11.Rb1 Nxd3+**

Eliminating White's best attacking piece.

**12.Qxd3 Bd7 13.Nc3**

13.Nbd4 allows Black to pick off a pawn with 13...Qa5+ 14.c3 Qxa2 .

**13...Rac8 14.O-O Rc4**

Seemingly without effort, Black already stands better, with pressure down the open c-file.

**15.Ne2?!**

White's knight crosses the street the way I do when I see someone passing out religious leaflets.

15.Rfd1 should be played to minimize White's advantage.

**15...Ng6 16.Ned4?**

Preconceived assumption has a way of blinding true perception. White's knights proceed as unhurriedly as grazing cows in the pasture, completely unaware of the farmer sharpening his axe for a coming slaughter. White, thinking he scored a minor victory with this knight post on d4, inadvertently allows his opponent a combination.

**16...Nf4! 17.Qe3**

EXERCISE (combination alert): This deceptive position reminds us of the movie line clichй: "It's quiet; too quiet." How did Black force the win of material here?

ANSWER: Attraction/knight fork.

**17...Rxd4!**

If we are unable to acquire our object of desire through negotiation, then the next step is to seize it through force of arms.

**18.g3?**

Now White loses an entire piece.

18.Nxd4 is met with 18...Qxd4! 19.Qxd4 Ne2+ 20.Kh1 Nxd4 when Black's two pieces are worth far more than White's extra rook. It looks as if Black is the beneficiary of lucky geometry, when in reality he laid out the groundwork for his 'luck' through previous strategic decisions.

**18...Re4**

To the white queen's utter amazement, a word issues forth from the rook's lips, one which she has never heard before: "No!". Black's winning idea in this version is of similar configuration to the answer given above, with only minor details altered.

**19.Qxb6 Ne2+**

Zwischenzug. Black will be up a piece when he recaptures White's queen next move.

DID YOU KNOW? The German word zwischenzug translates to: 'in-between move'.

SUMMARY: In my opinion White's plan 5 Bd2 and 6 Nb5 is slow, since Black undermines White's pawn centre with ...cxd4 and then later ...f6.

**0-1**

### Aeria,R. - Lakdawala,C. 2: San Diego (rapid), 2005

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4**

DID YOU KNOW? The Winawer French is named after Szymon Winawer, who was the top German player in the 1880's, until he was surpassed by Siegbert Tarrasch - for whom another line of the French was named.

**4.e5 c5 5.a3**

At long last, we reach the main lines of the Winawer.

**5...Bxc3+**

The players come to conceptual blows early on. Black hands over the bishop pair and risks future weakness on the dark squares to inflict upon White structural damage.

5...Ba5!? is probably unable to equalize after 6.b4! cxd4

(6...cxb4?! 7.Nb5! bxa3+ 8.c3 gives White a strong attack for the pawn)

7.Nb5 Bc7 8.f4 Ne7 9.Nf3 Bd7 10.Nxc7+ Qxc7 11.Bd3 . This is a theoretical position where I prefer White's chances, due to his extra central space, bishop pair, dark-square control and attacking chances.

**6.bxc3 Ne7 7.a4**

When we deliberately play the second best line, we are guilty of nepotism, where we pick our mediocre, dim-witted nephew for the job, over a better qualified applicant. This is Fischer's favourite move, which today is considered rather harmless for Black. Only 7 Qg4! pushes us theoretically. With 7 a4, White prepares Ba3, when the bishop goes unchallenged along the a3-f8 diagonal. 7 a4, along with 7 Nf3, doesn't require a ravenous study-appetite and is relatively simple to counter for Black.

In the next few games we look at 7.Nf3

and then White's most challenging option, 7.Qg4!

followed by 7.h4 .

**7...Nbc6 8.Nf3 Qa5**

TIP: We play our queen to a5 even though it may later come under fire when White plays his bishop to d2. The reason: we lure White's bishop off the superior a3-f8 diagonal to a less influential square.

**9.Bd2**

9.Qd2 is met with 9...b6 intending ...Ba6.

**9...Bd7 10.Bd3**

White is willing to lose a tempo to provoke ...c4, which takes the pressure off his centre and also devalues Black's remaining bishop by the placement of so many pawns on the same colour.

NOTE: Don't be concerned about White playing c4, with tempo, since White's c4 undermines the stability of his own centre. For example, 10.c4 Qc7 11.cxd5 exd5 (this move frees Black's game) 12.c3 O-O 13.Be2 Bg4 . Black equalized, and he may later be able to utilize the c4-square with ...Na5.

**10...c4 11.Be2 f6**

TIP: Normally we are taught to chip away at our opponent's pawn chain from its lowest link. Yet in many lines of the French Defence Black directly challenges White's e5 point at its head. With this move we issue a challenge in territory in which our opponent normally holds sway.

**12.exf6**

WARNING: I think handing over central dominance like this is similar to the aspiring actor who ends up as a waiter in a restaurant at Universal Studios - not exactly what he bargained for in the beginning.

This allows Black to open the g-file and eventually gain greater central influence when he plays ...e5.

White may be better off maintaining the e5 point with 12.O-O fxe5 13.Nxe5 Nxe5 14.dxe5 O-O . The game looks dynamically balanced.

**12...gxf6 13.O-O O-O-O**

A logical decision now that the g-file is open.

**14.Re1 Rhg8 15.Bf1 Qc7 16.g3**

Preparing Bg2 or Bh3.

**16...e5 17.Bg2**

17.dxe5!? fxe5 opens the game for White's bishops, but also allows Black free reign in the centre. This how I would have played it as White.

**17...Bg4 18.Qb1 e4 19.Nh4 Ng6!**

I want to straighten out my pawns.

**20.Nxg6 hxg6 21.Re3 Be6 22.Qf1**

This move is out of consonance with the position's ebb and flow. I don't know what to make of this ambiguous gesture, since it misplaces his queen.

He should go for the immediate 22.f3 f5 .

**22...g5 23.f3 f5 24.fxe4!?**

I wouldn't have taken, and instead would have played 24.Re2 .

**24...dxe4 25.g4?**

WARNING: Don't violate the principle: avoid unnecessary pawn pushes around your king. This effort to undermine Black's centre underestimates the danger to White's king.

He should play 25.Re2 .

**25...Rh8**

Target: h2.

**26.Rh3?**

This move courts strategic disaster and White heads inexorably toward one of life's Battle of Waterloo knocks, from Napoleon's perspective.

He had to try 26.h3 when White's position was dying, but not yet dead. The regaining of a minor victory, even when busted, still provides some measure of solace: 26...f4! 27.Rxe4 Bd5 28.Rae1

(28.Re2 is met by 28...f3! 29.Bxf3 Qg3+ 30.Bg2 Rxh3 with a winning attack)

28...Rdf8 29.Bf3 Bxe4 30.Rxe4 Qh7 with an inferior but still playable game for White.

**26...Rxh3 27.Bxh3 f4**

Black seems to be the sole beneficiary of the players' last barter. Now White's army gets treacly (American translation: molassesy!), bogged down due to Black's passed pawns.

**28.Qe2 Bd5 29.Bf1 Qe7 30.Bc1 Qe6 31.h3 Ne7 32.Rb1 a6**

Preventing Rb5.

**33.a5 e3 34.Bg2 Bxg2 35.Qxg2 Nd5**

When we fight on in a hopeless cause, we attempt to solve an unanswerable riddle. Just like my game against Barquin in the next chapter, Black's knight is overwhelmingly superior to White's remaining bishop.

**36.Qf3 Rd7 37.Bb2**

The taciturn bishop hasn't had a lot to say this game.

**37...Nf6 38.Ba3 Qd5**

There is a fine line between a strong negotiating position and outright blackmail. White can't afford to swap, but neither can he afford to keep queens on the board.

**39.Qxd5 Nxd5 40.Bb4**

The bishop multitasks, both able to pray and hate simultaneously. White can't be everywhere at once, since he is unable to cover c3 and prevent ...f3.

**40...f3**

Black's passed pawns feel as ubiquitous as ants emerging from their ant hill.

**41.Kh2 Rf7**

SUMMARY: Today, it's known that 7 a4 or 7 Nf3 (which we look at next game) is too mild to produce a white edge. Only 7 Qg4!, which we look at later in the chapter, puts pressure on Black's Winawer.

**0-1**

### Bologan,V. - Vitiugov,N. 3: Russian Team Championship, 2010

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Ne7 7.Nf3**

This line, like 7 a4, which we just looked at, is also innocuous and fails to pose Black insurmountable challenges.

**7...b6**

The idea is to debadify (it would be best if you don't google this 'word') Black's bad bishop via ...Ba6.

7...Nbc6 8.a4 transposes to our last game.

**8.Bb5+!**

TIP: In such cases Bb5+ loses time, yet it's a worthwhile investment, since it induces Black's bishop off the a6-f1 track.

**8...Bd7 9.Bd3 Ba4**

A good move, denying White a4.

**10.h4**

NOTE: The unforced push of the h-pawn is a common strategy against the French. White's idea is to seize valuable kingside space with h5 and then possibly lift the h1-rook into the game via h3. It also clears the way for Qg4, when Black is tied down to defence of g7.

**10...h6 11.h5 c4**

Gaining a tempo at the cost of weakening his dark squares further.

**12.Be2 Kd7!**

TIP: In Blocked positions, we can actually walk our king to the queenside, where it sits safer, due to Black's territorial edge.

A great player may come up with an astounding idea, and then the rest of us have to be content to copy it. I believe it was Mikhail Botvinnik, a three-time world champion, who first came up with this manoeuvre. The move looks almost like a mouse slip, but in this instance it is deliberate. Black's ideas:

1. The kingside grows dangerous for Black's king, so it strolls its way to queenside safety.

2. By lifting the king, Black makes room for another shocking manoeuvre, ...Qg8! and ...Qh7!.

**13.Bf4 Qg8! 14.Nd2 Qh7!**

Peek a boo. The queen pokes her head over the fence, increasing Black's influence on the light squares and threatening c2. We have reached another important French tabiya position.

**15.Ra2**

An indignity, but c2 required coverage.

**15...Na6**

Worrying White about future ...Nc7 and ...Nb5 ideas.

**16.g4**

White goes for a pawn storm plan rather than rely on piece play with a future Rh3.

**16...Nc7 17.Rh3 Raf8 18.Re3 Kc8 19.Bg3 Nc6 20.Nf3 Rhg8**

Black prepares for an eventual ...f6 or ...g6 break.

**21.Kd2**

Imitation is the sincerest form... White plays the same idea, transferring his king to the relative safety of the queenside.

**21...Kb7 22.Qh1**

And now the queen imitates Black's!

**22...Nb5**

Pressuring a3 and c3.

**23.Ne1 Nc7**

Black can also try 23...g5 , intending a future ...f6.

**24.Ng2 Re8 25.f4 f6**

At last, a clash of pawns.

**26.exf6!?**

Just like last game, I would have avoided this swap, which I believe helps Black.

**26...gxf6 27.Nh4 f5! 28.Ng6 fxg4 29.Bxg4 Qf7 30.Qh3 Ka6 31.Ra1 Ne7! 32.Nxe7?!**

After 32.Rxe6! Nxe6 33.Bxe6 Qh7 34.Bxg8 Rxg8 35.f5 Bd7 36.Rf1 Nxf5! 37.Rxf5 Rxg6 38.hxg6 Qxg6 39.Rf6 Qg5+ 40.Bf4 Qxf6 41.Qxd7 Qxf4+ 42.Kd1 I don't believe Black can convert his extra pawn, since White will deliver perpetual check.

**32...Rxe7 33.Rae1 Qf8 34.f5**

34.Bxe6?? loses to 34...Nxe6 35.Rxe6 Rxe6 36.Rxe6 Bd7 .

**34...Reg7! 35.Bd1 exf5**

White has been outplayed. He is down a pawn and his a3-pawn is also under fire.

**36.Rf1 Qxa3 37.Bxc7!**

Removing a defender of d5.

**37...Rxc7 38.Qxf5 Rg2+ 39.Re2 Rg5 40.Qf8!**

You may wonder why White is so annoyingly reasonable, offering to swap queens when two pawns down. On the surface it feels as if White's position, overtaxed by deprivation, is on the verge of collapse. Yet here he cunningly offers to enter an ending two pawns down, having seen that Black's alleged win is by no means as easy as it appears. So White's last move is the surgeon who commiserates with his once wheel-chair-bound patient after the surgery, telling him he will be able to walk again, but he may feel a touch of mild muscle ache from time to time as a result of the surgery. In essence, White's concession is no concession at all.

**40...Qxf8**

We can disagree as to what is Black's best plan, yet there is no dispute as to who holds the advantage. I have a feeling that this ending only promises Black false hope. It's hard to turn down an ending with two extra pawns, yet the win is by no means easy, since Black is tied down to defence of d5 and his h-pawn.

Perhaps Black should revise his initial thesis and evade the swap, as one would a bothersome fly, with 40...Qb2! intending ...Rg3.

**41.Rxf8 Rxh5 42.Rg2 Rh4 43.Bf3 Bc6**

The bishop agrees to his own internment.

**44.Rf6 Kb5**

In times past, people travelled in groups to ensure mutual protection. The king reinforces his bishop, while clearing the way for ...a5. Black is two pawns up, yet remains tied down.

**45.Rgg6 Rh2+ 46.Kc1 h5**

After an interminable delay, the pawn feels motion and all is secure for now. Yet it remains insufficiently protected. Now White gathers himself for fresh simultaneous assaults on Black's two weak pawns.

**47.Rh6 h4 48.Kb2 Bb7 49.Rf4 h3**

The weak h-pawn is adrift, clutching to flotsam on the open sea.

**50.Bg4 Rg7 51.Bxh3**

Defending such technical positions is about as much fun as tracing the genealogy of a royal family of a minor European duchy. This is a test of endurance for White, and so far he passed, with an A+ grade. The h-pawn's existence proves to be a solitary one. Black watches his advantage wither before his eyes. The weak h-pawn fell, and now White gets excellent chances to hold the game, since all the remaining pawns are fixed on the same side of the board.

**51...Re2 52.Rd6 Re1!**

Black threatens mate if he can double rooks on White's first rank.

**53.Rf1!**

Oh, no you don't! White avoids 53.Be6?? Rgg1 and his king is suddenly caught in a mating net.

**53...Rxf1 54.Bxf1**

Now White holds the game with ease, since Black is tied down to defence of d5. The remainder is a game of non-committal shuffling from both sides.

**54...Bc6 55.Be2 Rd7 56.Re6 Bb7 57.Bh5 Rd8 58.Be8+ Ka5 59.Re7 a6 60.Rxb7 Rxe8 61.Rd7**

The rook publicly declares something we suspected all along: the game is drawn.

SUMMARY: White should meet Black's plan of 7...b6 with 8 Bb5+, derailing Black's intent of ...Ba6. Also, remember the bizarro manoeuvre ...Kd7! followed by ...Qg8! and ...Qh7!.

**1/2-1/2**

### Anand,V. - Ivanchuk,V. 4: Nice (rapid), 2009

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Ne7 7.Qg4!**

This is the chess version of clearing one's throat to get the opponent's attention. Heavily theoretical lines are simultaneously our best friends/hateful overlords. Just to give you an idea of the complexity level of this line, Swedish GM Emanuel Berg wrote a 300+ page book on this position alone. The hippy-generated free love 1960's morphed into the free market, profit-is-the-bottom-line Reganesque 1980's. Chess openings experience such swings in philosophy as well. The older 7 a4 and 7 Nf3 have been virtually replaced with the dynamic and chaotic 7 Qg4! which is today considered White's best shot at an advantage against the Winawer.

**7...Qc7**

Ivanchuk obviously doesn't believe in baby steps. Sometimes we make an opening choice which part of us applauds for our bravery, and part of us decries for its risk. When we speculate with a sacrifice over the board, we do so with a hint of shame, as if confessing a vice to a priest. Welcome to the Poisoned Pawn line of the Winawer, one of the most theoretically dense positions in all of chess. To absorb the vast scope of its ideas, we must stretch our minds.

**8.Qxg7 Rg8 9.Qxh7**

The queen must be reminded again and again, that theft is not a 'hobby'. On the surface, it feels as if White has just picked off two pawns, but this isn't the real story.

**9...cxd4 10.Ne2!**

White covers against a queen check on c3, while ensuring that ...Qxe5 won't come with check.

**10...Nbc6 11.f4**

WARNING: It may look like White is just up two pawns if he plays 11.cxd4? .

In reality, this is a mini-trap. Black has the resource 11...Nxd4! when White is unable to recapture, since ...Qc3+ and ...Qxa1 would follow.

**11...Bd7 12.Qd3**

White's queen returns to the game and now cxd4 really is a threat.

**12...dxc3 13.Nxc3**

White picks up a pawn and simultaneously threatens Nb5. The trouble is taking c3 offers Black future counterplay down the c-file.

Also played here are the lines 13.Qxc3

13.Rb1

and 13.h4 Rc8 (it doesn't make sense to voluntarily renounce castling) 14.h5 Nf5 15.h6 d4 16.h7 Rh8 17.g4 Nfe7 18.Bg2 b5 19.Ng3 b4 20.Ne4 with a winning game for White, C.Lakdawala-A.Hanson, San Diego (rapid) 2005.

**13...a6**

Covering against White's threat Nb5, followed by Nd6+.

**14.Ne2 O-O-O 15.g3**

Easing the pressure down the g-file, while preparing to complete kingside development with Bg2.

**15...d4**

NOTE: Following the principle: create confrontation when leading in development.

**16.Qc4**

Black's offer is untouchable.

16.Nxd4?? Nxd4 17.Qxd4 Bc6 and the double attack picks off White's h1-rook.

**16...Nf5 17.Bg2 Na5!**

TIP: In such cases Black can even enter pawn-down endings and be fine, since he or she relies on active pieces and c-file pressure. In this instance, Ivanchuk does not violate the poet Browning's admonition to never allow one's reach to exceed one's grasp.

**18.Qxc7+ Kxc7 19.Rb1 Bc6**

Eliminating White's best piece.

**20.Bxc6 Kxc6!**

ENDGAME PRINCIPLE: Use your king in the endgame.

**21.Kf2 d3 22.cxd3 Rxd3**

Black's powerful activity makes up for White's extra pawn, and the game remains balanced.

**23.Rg1 Rh8 24.h4 Nc4 25.a4 b6 26.Ra1 Kd5! 27.Ra2 Ke4!**

Black's king is a fighting piece in this ending.

**28.Re1 Nh6**

Clearing f5 for his king.

**29.Kg2 Ng4 30.Ng1+ Kf5 31.Nf3 a5?**

When our opponent plays very well for most of the game and then botches it in time pressure, somehow our joy at our good fortune feels indecent. Now is not the time to be playing tiddlywinks (come to think of it, I have no idea how to play tiddlywinks!). Move orders matter. Only by accomplishing 'A', do we then get to 'B'. Black's last move is an error, after which the advantage swings to White.

Black should play 31...Nce3+ 32.Bxe3 Nxe3+ 33.Kh3 Kg6 , after which his position sways and bends, yet fails to crack.

**32.Ng5 Kg6 33.Rae2 Rb3 34.f5+!**

The art of calculation is to correctly decipher what piece is doing what, to whom. Anand stokes his initiative with a powerful line-opening sacrifice, and the defence is unable to withstand the battering ram.

**34...exf5**

34...Kxf5?? 35.Nxf7 Rh7 36.Nd6+ Nxd6 37.Rf1+ Kg6 38.exd6 e5 39.Kh3 Nh6 40.Rxe5 and Black collapses.

**35.e6! f6 36.e7**

The e-pawn turns out to be the disputatious foul-mouthed dummy, who makes life miserable for his ventriloquist, who happens to be Black's king.

**36...Re8**

EXERCISE (combination alert): How did Anand force the win of material from this position?

ANSWER: Attraction.

**37.h5+! Kxh5 38.Ne6! Kg6**

38...Rxe7?? hangs a full rook to 39.Rh1+ Kg6 40.Nf4+ Kf7 41.Rh7+ .

**39.Nc7 Kf7**

The exhausted king walks on feet which no longer have any feeling. He has no choice but to dutifully follow White's e-pawn the way a meek squire follows his bossy, unreasonable knight.

**40.Nxe8 Kxe8**

"I will regain my crown someday," pouts the king. "Of course you will," consoles White's knight, in a soothing tone he reserves for children or stupid adults. Not only did White win an exchange, but his passed e-pawn remains alive and well for now.

**41.Re6 Rc3 42.Bf4 Rc2+ 43.Kg1**

World champions don't fall for doltish traps like 43.Kh3?? Rh2#

or 43.Kf3?? Rf2# .

**43...Nce5 44.Bxe5 Nxe5 45.Re3**

This docile move is necessary to cover f3.

45.Rxf6?? Nf3+ allows Black to escape.

**45...Nd7 46.Rd6!**

Threat: Rxd7! and e8=Q.

**46...Rc7 47.Kg2**

Anand finishes with the soft spoken competence of an undertaker.

SUMMARY: The heavily theoretical Poisoned Pawn line is one where a single new move from either side can render a long played move obsolete overnight. In many positions it's not easy to extract even a semi-coherent plan for either side, so study it well. This game is merely a taste of what is involved if you take up the line. You will need supplemental material beyond this book. If you don't have the time or inclination to take this step, then you are better off playing a more non-theoretical version, with either Black or White.

**1-0**

### Karjakin,S. - Vallejo Pons,F. 5: Bilbao, 2012

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Ne7 7.Qg4**

Such lines are part of some player's genetic code, like snoring and sugar addiction.

**7...O-O**

Chess is that strange place where opposing evaluations of a single position may both be correct. I happen to believe that Black's resources are fully adequate here. Now we get a true taste of the phrase 'castling into it', where the 'it' part of the equation, should it come to pass, will be checkmate, if we don't know what we are doing in this line as Black.

**8.Bd3 Nbc6**

8...f5 is also played here.

**9.Qh5!**

White is in full interrogative mode, threatening mate.

This may be White's most dangerous line: 9.Nf3 f5 10.exf6 Rxf6 11.Bg5 Rf7 with mutual chances and Black scores over 50% from this point.

9.Bg5 (strategic threat: Bf6) 9...Qa5 (unpinning with tempo) 10.Ne2 Ng6 11.O-O Qa4! . Black menaces ...c4 and also ...Nxce5!, and chances are about even here.

**9...Ng6**

A pawn move would suicidally weaken Black's king. Black is perfectly aware of his opponent's machinations, yet has faith in his inherent defensive resources.

**10.Nf3**

Threat: Ng5, and if ...h6, then Nxf7! undermining the g6-knight.

**10...Qc7!**

TIP: Remember this trick, which tactically covers against White's Ng5 and Nxf7 idea.

**11.Be3**

11.Ng5 isn't all that effective. Black can play 11...h6! walking into White's trap, which is no trap at all: 12.Nxf7 Qxf7 13.Qxg6 Qxg6!

(13...Qxf2+?? loses to 14.Kd1 Rf7 15.Bxh6)

14.Bxg6 cxd4 15.cxd4 Nxd4 when Black's superior structure counterbalances White's bishops.

**11...c4**

This move represents a kind of nullity, in that it freezes the queenside structure for both sides.

**12.Bxg6!**

The meek 12.Be2?! f6 scores well for Black.

**12...fxg6 13.Qg4 Qf7**

Such positions confound those who seek assured truths. We reach another important Winawer tabiya, where the bishops of opposite colours play a key role in the players' destinies.

**14.Ng5**

The knight's romance with Black's queen, like Heathcliff's and Cathy's in Wuthering Heights, meets barriers through a finely defined class system of social taboos.

**14...Qe8!**

WARNING: 14...Qf5?! loses time to 15.Qe2 Re8 16.h4 h6 17.g4 . In my database Black scores 0% from this position, which I'm guessing is a tad below the norm.

**15.h4**

Preparing to pry open the h-file.

**15...Ne7**

Instead, 15...h6 16.Nh3 Bd7 17.Nf4 Ne7 18.Rh3 Qf7 19.Kd2 Kh7 20.Qe2 b5 21.g4 a5 22.Rb1 Rab8 23.Rg3 Kg8 24.Rf3 Qe8 25.h5?! was M.Khachian-C.Lakdawala, Internet (blitz) 2006. Here Black looks better after 25...g5! 26.Nh3 Nc6 27.Rxf8+ Qxf8 28.Ra1 b4 .

**16.a4!?**

I think this pawn sacrifice is an inadvisable waste of generosity, even though it is Komodo's top choice. White gives up a pawn to transfer his bishop to the powerful a3-square.

That said, 16.h5 is met with the clogging idea 16...h6 17.Nf3 g5 when Black stands better.

**16...a5**

Fixing a4 as a target.

**17.Qe2 Bd7 18.g4 Ra6 19.Bc1 Bxa4 20.Ba3 h6 21.Nh3 b5 22.Bc5 Rc6 23.Bd6 Rf7 24.h5! gxh5 25.g5!**

TIP: The line opening, puncturing pawn sacrifice h5! gxh5; g5! is thematic of this line.

**25...Nf5 26.gxh6 Nxh6**

26...g6 would be my defensive choice.

**27.Kd2?**

An incoherency, after which White no longer has compensation for the pawn.

He should enter an even ending with 27.Qxh5 Rf8 28.Qxe8 Rxe8 29.Kd2 .

**27...Rf5 28.Rhg1 Rb6 29.f3 b4 30.Qe3 Nf7 31.Bc5 Rb7 32.Rg2 Qb5?!**

The lovesick queen chases White's king like a mare in heat. The correct plan's whereabouts is a mystery for Black, who may be in time pressure.

32...b3! gives Black a winning position.

**33.Rag1 bxc3+?**

Failure and achievement can be a hair's breadth from the other. When it comes to our near-misses, we would all love a bout of amnesia, since it's hard to blame ourselves for past sins when we are unable to remember their existence. In our cases where we do remember them, we rationalize our losses (i.e. 'I wasn't feeling well that day') with a dialectical genius which even Plato and Aristotle would deeply envy.

Black gets a winning position with the sacrifice 33...Nxe5! 34.dxe5 bxc3+ 35.Ke2 Qb2 36.Kf2 Qxc2+ 37.Kg3 Qd3 38.Nf4 Qxe3 39.Bxe3 Rbf7 with too many pawns for the piece.

**34.Ke2 Nxe5!**

Now Black's rook protects g7.

**35.Qh6!**

35.dxe5? Qb2 is a winning attack for Black.

**35...Rff7 36.Qxe6 Ng4 37.Ng5! Qb2??**

It's a dangerous luxury to deal with the trivial when an issue of much larger scale looms.

EXERCISE (combination alert): The black queen's last move isn't exactly a warm expression fealty to her king. White to play and force mate.

ANSWER: Weak back rank.

**38.Qc8+!**

SUMMARY: I think the position after 7...O-O is every bit as tricky as the Poisoned Pawn line, which we looked at last game. Look for supplementary material on the line and familiarize yourself with its themes.

**1-0**

### Kasparov,G. - Ivanchuk,V. 6: Horgen, 1995

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 b6**

The more strategic route. Black avoids the heavy theory stemming from the sharper 4...c5, and the now familiar idea is to play ...Ba6, swapping away White's powerful light-squared bishop.

Instead: 4...Ne7

(this line is a cousin to 4...b6)

5.a3

(5.Qg4 O-O 6.Bd3 f5 is okay for Black)

5...Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 b6 7.Qg4 Ng6 8.h4 h5 9.Qg3 Ba6 10.Bxa6 Nxa6 11.Ne2 Qd7 12.a4 with a sharp and unbalanced position where White probably holds a slight edge due to his central space.

Next game we look at 4...Qd7 .

**5.a3**

TIP: After 5.Qg4 Bf8 don't be afraid of the loss of time to play ...Bf8, preserving your valuable dark-squared bishop, while covering g7. For example, 6.a4!?

(6.Bb5+ c6 7.Ba4 a5 8.Bb3 is the main theoretical line)

6...Nc6! (taking advantage of the weakness on b4, as well as halting a5) 7.Bb5 Bb7 8.Nf3 a6 9.Be2 Qd7 (with the idea of ...f5!) 10.O-O , E.Sevilliano-C.Lakdawala, 2007. Chances were roughly balanced after Black castled long.

**5...Bf8**

This bizarre move arrests the eye. On the surface, this may look like an insane loss of time for Black. Not all ideas need to be as unarguable as a maths theorem, and it is possible for a thing to be itself, while simultaneously something else. Black violates the principle of moving the same piece twice in the opening and undeveloping it to its square of origin. Yet despite appearances, the move is perfectly playable, based on the principle: in closed positions, quality of development (or in this case undevelopment!) trumps quantity.

Also playable is 5...Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Qd7 7.Qg4 f5 .

**6.Nf3**

6.Bd3 is a tempo loss which plays into Black's hands after 6...Ba6 .

**6...Ne7 7.h4**

We talked about the push of the h-pawn in an earlier game in the chapter as a typical way for White to increase a kingside space advantage.

**7...h6 8.h5 a5 9.Bb5+**

TIP: White often dodges Black's ...Ba6 idea with Bb5+, followed by Ba4. However, the move does lose time for White.

**9...c6 10.Ba4 Nd7 11.Ne2**

Multipurpose:

1. White prepares to swing the knight over to the kingside in preparation for an attack.

2. White plans to play c3 and Bc2 to bring his light-squared bishop back into play.

**11...b5 12.Bb3 c5 13.c3 Nc6 14.O-O Qc7 15.Re1 c4**

Black's queenside initiative and space counters White's ambitions on the other side of the board.

**16.Bc2 Nb6 17.Bf4**

Overprotecting e5, but Black has no intention of activating White by playing the suicidal ...f6.

**17...Be7 18.Bg3 Rb8**

In preparation of a ...b4 break.

**19.Nh2 Qd8**

Ivanchuk removes his queen off the g3-bishop's diagonal, perhaps worried about future Nf6+ sacrifices.

**20.Ng4 b4**

The cold war finally turns a touch hotter.

**21.axb4 axb4 22.cxb4?!**

Kasparov, hoping to eliminate all his potentially weak queenside pawns, violates the principle: avoid confrontation on the opponent's strong wing.

Chances look balanced after 22.f4 .

**22...Nxb4 23.Bb1 Bd7 24.b3?!**

The same principle is violated.

**24...Ra8 25.Rxa8 Qxa8 26.bxc4 Nxc4 27.Nc1?**

EXERCISE (planning): White's last move allows Black a way to win the d4-pawn. How?

ANSWER:

**27...Ba4!**

Step 1: Drive away White's queen from coverage of d4. Ivanchuk sidles to his intent in an indirect manner, rather than with head-on confrontation.

**28.Qe2**

When we have but one forced move, we eliminate the '...on the other hand' argument.

28.Nb3? walks into a decisive pin.

**28...Qa7!**

Step 2: Attack d4, which can no longer be protected. It's that simple, and the planning required for Ivanchuk's idea isn't equivalent to that of the D-day invasion.

**29.Ne3 Qxd4**

"The rich get richer and the poor dine on macaroni and cheese," comments the queen to her impoverished e2 sister.

**30.Nxc4 dxc4 31.Qf1**

The queen gets demoted and resigns herself to her new post as junior chamber pot-emptier maid.

**31...O-O**

I believe it was George Bernard Shaw who theorized that lack of money is the root of all evil. White is down a pawn and his pieces driven to uncharacteristic passivity, so Kasparov, feeling it a waste of energy to pursue alteration of an unchangeable future, resigned.

DID YOU KNOW? This was the only game Kasparov lost with the white pieces in a ten year period.

SUMMARY: This line, although optically bizarre, after 5...Bf8, is very playable for Black. The move is in open transgression of the principle: thou shalt not dilly-dally in the opening; yet White's huge development lead is often frustrated by a lack of viable targets.

**0-1**

### Arutyunov,N. - Lakdawala,C. 7: San Diego (rapid), 2015

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 Qd7**

NOTE: This move is a touch different to its cousin 4...b6, since it allows Black an ...f5 option on White's 5 Qg4. I have an unspoken agreement with ultra-sharp lines: I won't play them very often, and they in turn have agreed not to checkmate me! As with 4...b6, this line isn't one of those theoretically straitjacketing ones, where if we garble the chronology of the move order, we face immediate and terrible retribution.

**5.a3**

5.Qg4 is met with 5...f5 .

**5...Bxc3+**

5...Bf8 is similar to what we looked at last game, and may well transpose later on: 6.f4!? b6 7.b4!? c6 8.b5 a6! 9.bxc6 Nxc6 10.Nf3 Nge7 11.Bd3 h5 12.O-O g6 13.Be3 Na5 14.a4 Qc7 15.Ne2 Nc4 when Black's control over c4 makes up for White's kingside and central space, A.Costello-C.Lakdawala, San Diego (rapid) 2016.

**6.bxc3 b6**

Once again we observe a battle between the unstoppable force and the immovable object. This is a position conducive to divergent interpretations, depending on the reader's style. From my perspective, I feel comfortable from Black's side.

**7.Nf3**

This move is too mild to worry Black.

7.Qg4 is White's only shot at an edge: 7...f5 8.Qg3

(8.exf6?! Nxf6 is a bad deal for White, since Black's development lead outweighs the ill-effects of the backward e6-pawn)

8...Ba6 9.Bxa6 Nxa6 10.Ne2 Nb8 (the knight is to be re-routed to c4) 11.Nf4 Kf7!

(11...Nc6? 12.Nxe6! Qxe6 13.Qxg7)

12.Qf3 Ne7 13.Qh5+ Kg8 14.h4 Nbc6 15.Rh3 Rf8 16.Rg3 Rf7 17.Nh3 Na5 . Kingside and queenside chances look balanced, M.Khachiyan-C.Lakdawala, Century City 2002.

**7...Ba6 8.Bxa6 Nxa6 9.Qd3**

Alternatively, 9.a4 Ne7 10.O-O Nb8 (heading for c4) 11.Qd3 Nbc6 12.c4 (White undoubles his pawns before Black blockades them) 12...dxc4 13.Qxc4 Na5 14.Qd3 Rd8 15.Ba3 h6 16.Rfd1 O-O 17.Qb5 Rfe8 18.Bb4 Nec6 19.c3 Qd5 20.Bxa5 Nxa5 21.h3 Re7 22.Qb4 Red7 23.Rab1 Nc4 . Advantage Black, who had a grip on the dark squares, D.Aldama-C.Lakdawala, San Diego (rapid) 2013.

**9...Qa4!**

As always in this line, Black's influence on the light squares counterbalances White's power on dark.

**10.O-O Ne7 11.Bg5 c5!?**

Is it possible to be simultaneously thirsty and drowning? I allow my opponent to disrupt my castling if he hands over his influential bishop.

**12.Bxe7**

The bishop writes out the bull of excommunication for Black's king, who doesn't care, since he is an atheist.

**12...Kxe7**

White and Black's intents pulsate to different rhythms:

1. My king runs off to who-knows-where, which, as we all understand, is an indeterminate location. Still, I feel like my king is relatively safe, since White's once copious supply of attackers dwindled with three sets of minor piece exchanges. Also, for now, the centre remains relatively closed.

2. My structure is without weakness, while White's damaged one virtually ensures a painful ending, should queens come off the board.

3. I removed his bishop from the board, so a dark square pandemic has been averted.

Conclusion: I'm happy with the transaction.

**13.Nh4**

Clearing the way for f4 and f5, as well as Qg3.

**13...Rac8**

Pressure builds for White down the c-file and he must do something quickly to counteract it.

**14.f4 cxd4 15.cxd4**

I expected 15.f5 . Black looks better after 15...Nc5! 16.Qf3 Rcf8 17.fxe6 fxe6 18.Qg4 g6 19.cxd4 Ne4 when his king is safe for now, while White's structure remains vulnerable.

**15...Qc4**

Of course, Black would love a queen swap, which would remove all the pressure off my king.

**16.Qg3!?**

The nuclear option. This kind of sacrifice is catnip for a natural attacker.

**16...Qxd4+**

I am intent on disproving the theory of less is more. Wrong! More is more!

**17.Kh1 g6 18.Qg5+?!**

White looks better off going for 18.Nf3! Qa4 19.Qg5+ Kd7 20.Qf6 Rhe8 21.Ng5 with better attacking chances than in the game continuation.

**18...Kd7 19.Qf6 Qc5!**

In such a position, the system is rigged to favour the wealthy. The imperative of survival overwhelms all other petty concerns, so I offer the extra pawn back to get a better ending.

**20.Nf3**

I expected him to open lines with 20.c4 Qe7! 21.cxd5 Qxf6 22.exf6 exd5 23.Rad1 Kd6 with a winning ending for Black.

Instead, 20.Qxf7+ allows Black to force queens off the board with 20...Qe7 21.Qxe7+ Kxe7 when White's structure remains vulnerable in the ending.

**20...Qe7 21.Qg7 h6!**

Preventing Ng5 and worrying White about a forced trade after ...Rcg8, when Black's rooks tisk tisk in unison at White's out-of-play queen, who roosts on g7 like a senile owl.

**22.f5?**

This is contributing evidence of White's decline. His move is made with the philosophy: when confronted with an unpleasant task, it's better done sooner than later.

22.c4 was his best shot.

**22...gxf5 23.Qg3 Rhg8 24.Qf2 Rc4**

White is down two pawns and his attack is no more.

SUMMARY: The only difference between 4...Qd7 and 4...b6 is that 4...Qd7 allows Black to meet 5.Qg4 with 5...f5, when g7 is protected laterally.

**0-1**

### Khachian,M. - Lakdawala,C. 8: San Diego (rapid), 2009

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Nc6!?**

I picked this oddball line to try and throw the GM out of his opening comfort zone.

Black's other sidelines: 6...Ne7 7.Qg4 Kf8!? 8.h4 Qc7 9.Qd1 cxd4 10.cxd4 Qc3+ 11.Bd2 Qxd4 12.Nf3 Qe4+ 13.Be2 b6 14.O-O Ba6 15.c4 , G.Kasparov-P.Nikolic, Horgen 1994. White's development lead fully compensates for his two missing pawns after 15...Bxc4 16.Bxc4 dxc4 17.Rc1 .

6...Qc7 7.Qg4 f5 8.Qg3 cxd4 9.cxd4 Ne7 10.Bd2 O-O 11.Bd3 b6 12.Ne2 Ba6 13.Nf4 Qd7 14.h4 Bxd3 15.Qxd3 . Most annotators feel that White's kingside chances slightly outweigh Black's on the queenside, but I am not one who shares this opinion, and feel like Black is dynamically even, G.Kasparov-N.Short, Novgorod 1997.

6...Qa5 7.Bd2 Qa4 8.Qg4 g6 is very close to what we got in my game against Khachian, and may well transpose.

**7.Qg4 g6**

This move creates a huge potential liability on the weakened dark squares later on.

**8.Nf3**

Playing it safe.

White may get an edge with 8.h4! Qa5 9.Bd2 Qa4 10.h5! , and if 10...Nxe5? Black should decline both e5 and c2 offers.

**8...Qa5 9.Bd2 Qa4**

NOTE: On a4, the queen pressures d4 and c2.

**10.Ra2 c4**

Black has a horrible bishop and is punctured on the dark squares. On the other hand, White takes on serious queenside weaknesses and an offside rook.

**11.h4!?**

The statement 'once upon a time' asks the reader not to ask embarrassing questions like: "Is your story based in reality?" Although not a calamitous lapse in judgement, my feeling is that White's sacrifice is slightly dubious, although the comp backs him up with a slightly favourable evaluation.

11.Be2 is the safer route.

**11...Qb5!**

I experienced a quickening of expectations, threatening to win his a2-rook with ...Qb1+.

**12.Ra1 Qb2 13.Rc1**

My opponent considered his a3-pawn the drossiest of all the dross available, while I thought: "Hey, groovy, a free pawn!"

**13...h6!**

The idea is to meet h5 with ...g5.

I parry and feint, rather than sink my threat home into tender flesh with the greedy line 13...Qxa3!? , a move made with the warning: Oliver Twist would have spared himself a lot of anguish had he not asked Mr. Bumble for "some more".

**14.h5 g5 15.Nh2!**

Clearing the way for f4. Black must act, or face dissolution of his kingside.

**15...f5!**

In each game both sides should expect a few mild slaps in the face, when our opponent makes an unexpected move below our mental radar. Melik said he overlooked this idea, where Black either closes the kingside, or develops with tempo.

**16.exf6**

He is forced to lose more time to clear the e5-square for his pieces.

16.Qd1? Qxa3 is hopeless for White since the kingside is pretty much sealed.

**16...Nxf6 17.Qe2 Ne4 18.Qe3 Bd7 19.Ng4 O-O-O 20.f3 Ng3 21.Rh3**

EXERCISE (combination alert): My position's mood is one of euphoric opportunity, as if something wonderful is around the corner. How can Black gain a winning attack?

**21...Nf5?!**

Moves like this are one of the reasons that the name Lakdawala is not one which is feared in chess tournaments around the world. It isn't easy to pluck a handful of order from chaos. When we miss a combination, it's as if a character in a play burns a letter, whose contents are never to be revealed to the audience.

ANSWER: I missed a great chance with 21...e5!! . Principle: open the game and create confrontation when leading in development. After 22.dxe5

(or 22.Rxg3?? exd4 23.Qf2 dxc3 24.Be3 d4 and Black wins)

22...Bxg4 23.Rxg3 Rhe8 24.f4 Bxh5 White is busted.

**22.Qe2 Qxa3 23.f4! Qe7?**

23...gxf4 24.Bxf4 Rdf8 maintains Black's edge.

**24.fxg5 hxg5 25.Ne5 Nxe5 26.Qxe5 g4 27.Bf4**

Threatening mate on two different squares.

**27...Bc6?**

Losing my equilibrium. Now White's attack grows potent.

**28.Rh1 Kd7**

"Another fine mess you've gotten me into," I thought to myself, channelling Oliver Hardy. When I bungle a game, I always ask: "Why does cruel Caissa the chess goddess always favour the undeserving?", who in every instance is my opponent! White stands better and I took my opponent's draw offer, which gave him clear first place in the tournament (a concession I took solely for medicinal purposes). Normally tenacity is your writer's middle name (in truth, my middle name, to my abiding shame, is Freddy). I felt the position would be almost impossible to win for Black, but very easy to lose.

SUMMARY: 6...Nc6!?, along with lines 'a', 'b', and 'c' below it, are quirky side lines which can be used as surprise weapons.

**1/2-1/2**

## 2: The Winawer: 4th move

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4**

In this chapter we examine White's fourth move dodges of the main line Winawer, where there is no single generically universal one plan fits all. The difficulty level of the lines may vary from plucking a daisy, to uprooting a stump of a 100-year-old oak tree. I dream of living in a mannerly world, but of course this is a fantasy when facing a tactician, who lives for gratuitous violence on the chess board. Be especially careful in lines 'b', 'c', and 'e', which can get very tactical, and are the pit bull on amphetamines route for White.

From this position White can play:

**4.--**

4.exd5 , which leads to a toothless line akin to the Exchange Variation, where the landscape alters as much as your computer's screen saver. We can later try and play for a win with the unbalancing ...Bxc3, where we give up the bishop pair to inflict damage upon White's pawn structure.

With 4.Nge2 White prevents a doubling of pawns on c3, at the cost of clogging his or her development. We take White's pawn offer on e4 and hang on to it like grim death.

4.a3 sees White encourage ...Bxc3+, at the cost of a tempo. We take the knight and then White's e-pawn. White follows with Qg4 with a double attack on e4 and g7.

4.Bd3 . The trouble with this move is that Black gains a tempo on the bishop with ...dxe4, followed by ...Nf6.

4.Bd2 is a dangerous pawn sacrifice, which I recommend that we decline.

### Barquin,B. - Lakdawala,C. 9: San Diego (rapid), 2006

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.exd5**

This move is too milquetoast for any hope of a white advantage and basically hands Black an even game at the outset. When a natural tactician/attacker like my opponent Ben plays a line this opposite to his natural inclination; it's a little like Mike Tyson applying for a teaching job for an anger management course. White's move turns it into a harmless variant of the Exchange French, with the added moves Nc3 and ...Bb4. White often picks up the bishop pair with a future a3 and ...Bxc3+, which we don't mind, since we gain time and inflict damage upon White's structure as compensation.

Last chapter we looked at 4.e5 , the main line.

**4...exd5**

A more principled move than recapturing with the queen. We stake out our fair share of the centre.

**5.h3!?**

Not exactly intimidating if you have black pieces here. White wants to play Nf3 without allowing ...Bg4.

White's main line runs 5.Bd3 c6 and Black can set up in any number of ways. This is a solid version: 6.Nge2 (White covers his c3-knight, while leaving his f-pawn free to move forward later on in pursuit of a kingside attack) 6...Ne7 .

TIP: Black can take the sting out of White's future attack with the idea of ...Ne7 and ...Bf5, which swaps away White's light-squared bishop, the most dangerous potential attacker. 7.O-O Bf5 comes as a warning to the opponent to limit his attacking ambitions. Black equalized, H.Stefansson-N.Vitiugov, Gibraltar 2015.

**5...Bf5**

Pre-empting Bd3.

**6.Nf3 Ne7**

This supports Black's control over f5, while avoiding a potential pin.

**7.Bd3 Nbc6 8.O-O O-O**

I also considered sharpening the game with 8...Qd7 and then castling long.

**9.Bf4 Bxc3!?**

NOTE: We weigh the considerations and chop on c3. This is an attempt to play for a win against a lower-rated player by creating an imbalance of bishop for a knight, in exchange for damage to White's structure. Also, my move is a way to veer away from the hyper-sedate state of being one is threatened with when entering virtually any version of the Exchange French.

**10.bxc3**

When an object breaks, it will either heal into a stronger version of itself, or it just can't be patched together again. It's too early to tell which way it will go for White's queenside pawns.

**10...Na5**

The idea is to blockade c4, preventing White from undoubling his c-pawns with c4.

**11.Rb1 f6**

Seizing control over e5.

**12.Re1 Bg6**

I would indeed like to trade the bishops, but on my terms, not his.

Chopping on d3 allows 12...Bxd3 13.cxd3 , after which White seizes control over c4.

**13.Bb5?**

WARNING: One moment of planlessness and our otherwise well thought-out idea can easily lapse into banality. This is an inexplicable waste of two tempi.

White should play more vigorously with something like 13.Nh2! intending h4 and h5.

**13...c6 14.Bd3 Re8 15.Qd2 Qd7 16.Re2?!**

The window of intervention narrows for White.

16.Nh4 is better.

**16...Nc4 17.Bxc4?**

The bargain struck is one sided.

White should back down and retain some degree of control over his light squares with 17.Qd1 .

**17...dxc4**

Not only does Black own the more potent bishop, but now Black's knight can roost on d5. White is guaranteed a miserable ending, since his queenside pawn structure is vulnerable to attack.

**18.Rbe1 Nd5 19.Nh4 Bf7!?**

I saw a small tactic, yet rejected it, since I mistakenly thought my advantage was greater in not playing the combination.

The computer admonishes me, however, and insists on playing 19...Bxc2 which I dismissively tossed aside. Black overloads White's queen and wins a pawn, since 20.Rxe8+ Rxe8 21.Rxe8+ Qxe8 22.Qxc2 Nxf4 leaves Black up a clean pawn. Yet I far prefer the position I reached in the game to this one.

**20.Nf3 Rxe2 21.Rxe2 Bh5! 22.Kh2**

22.g4?? is met with 22...Bxg4! winning.

**22...Bxf3 23.gxf3**

More pockmarks to White's already cratered structure.

**23...Re8 24.Re4 b5 25.Bg3 Kf7 26.Kg2 Re6 27.Qe1 Qe7 28.h4**

This creates another pawn target for Black.

**28...f5!**

Now ...f4 is a serious threat for White.

**29.Rxe6 Qxe6 30.Qd2**

White must keep queens on the board, or else Black's knight will pick off the c3-pawn.

**30...Qh6! 31.f4**

WARNING: This kind of move violates the principle: don't fix your pawns on the same colour as your remaining bishop.

Now White's bishop is no more than a glorified pawn, whose guilty look is one of a school boy who smokes in a crouch on the toilet seat in the boy's bathroom.

31.Qxh6? gxh6 is hopeless for White too though, since c3 falls.

**31...Qe6 32.a3 Qe4+ 33.Kg1 h5 34.Kf1 a5**

I was low on the clock and was determined to avoid that awful realm of meaninglessness, where we cease to worry about the chess aspect of our move, in a desperate attempt to outrun our clock. We essentially turn into a hybrid of blind Oedipus and insane King Lear. In such cases it's best to keep the game completely under our control. In this case the winning process isn't exactly a conundrum which only a master logician can unravel.

I prefer to go incremental rather than exponential with 34...Qh1+! 35.Ke2 Qa1 , which with hindsight looks like an easier win.

**35.Kg1 a4 36.Kf1 g6 37.Kg1 Ke7 38.Kf1 Kd8**

TIP: Procrastination is the entity who whispers into our ear, providing convenient excuses to why we should get around to doing a task which needs doing - someday.

When your opponent has no way to improve his position, then take your sweet time, which adds a further psychological burden to 'do' something.

**39.Kg1 Kd7 40.Kf1 Qf3**

The moment of reckoning draws near and c3 falls.

**41.Ke1**

I read that some long incarcerated inmates actually grow fearful as their release date approaches, since then they are forced to make decisions without someone ordering them about.

Instead, if 41.Qe1 Nxc3 and now White is unable to make a run at a perpetual check with 42.Qe5? since 42...Qh1# is mate. White's king finds it deeply offensive that his sister only speaks to him through the excrement infested dungeon cell's bars with a perfumed handkerchief pressed firmly to her nose.

**41...Nxc3**

SUMMARY: 4...exd5 leads to an equal line of the Exchange French.

**0-1**

### Braga,F. - Korchnoi,V. 10: Sao Paulo, 1979

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Nge2**

White protects his c3-knight from the potential damage to his structure, but at a high cost:

1. White's e4-pawn is sacrificed and there is no guarantee he regains it.

2. Nge2 clogs White's kingside development.

**4...dxe4**

The most natural move. Black grabs e4 and dares his opponent to either regain the pawn, or prove compensation.

I often play 4...Nc6!? 5.a3 Ba5 6.b4 Bb6 7.e5 f6 8.f4 fxe5 9.dxe5 a6 (to preserve the bishop) 10.Qd3 Nh6 . White found himself behind in development and struggling, R.Bruno-C.Lakdawala, San Diego (rapid) 2007.

**5.a3 Bxc3+**

The more adventurous path.

5...Be7 6.Nxe4 Nf6 is a safer path to equality for Black.

**6.Nxc3 Nc6**

Counterattacking d4.

**7.Bb5**

After 7.d5 exd5 8.Qxd5 Be6 9.Qxe4 Nf6 , Black's development lead makes up for White's bishop pair.

**7...Nge7 8.Bg5**

White regards Black's e4-pawn as superfluous clutter and is happy to give it away.

8.Nxe4 is met with 8...Qd5! and I'm not so confident White gets full compensation for the pawn.

**8...f6 9.Be3 O-O 10.Qd2**

NOTE: It isn't so easy for White to regain his sacrificed pawn in this line. If 10.Nxe4? f5 11.Ng5 f4 12.Bd2 Qd5! 13.Bxc6 Nxc6 14.Nf3 Nxd4 and Black picks up a clean pawn.

**10...f5**

DID YOU KNOW? Many players believe that art is the opposite of utility.

Viktor Korchnoi didn't. He, along with Emanuel Lasker and Bobby Fischer, turned pawn grabbing into an art form.

Black manages to hold on to his extra pawn. For it White gets some degree of dark-square control and the bishop pair. My personal preference is for Black's side.

**11.Bg5?!**

This proves to be a waste of time.

The main line runs 11.O-O-O a6 12.Bxc6 Nxc6 13.f3 . Even here White's attack for the pawn is by no means a richly endowed charity with endless resources, although there is compensation for the pawn, W.Giblin-C.Holland, London 1994.

**11...h6 12.Bxe7**

12.Bxc6 bxc6 gives Black an open b-file to attack.

**12...Nxe7 13.O-O-O**

Opposite wings castling is a world where you say "East!" and your opponent says "West!".

**13...Nd5 14.Bc4 c6 15.f3 exf3 16.gxf3 Qh4 17.Ne2 f4!**

Prolonged defence tends to offend a proud spirit, and Korchnoi seizes the initiative on the kingside, which is normally White's province in this line.

**18.Rdg1 Qf2! 19.Rg6**

White's attempts to attack at this stage feel like the poor man with a toothache, who powers up his drill to perform his own root canal to save money by circumventing the dentist's bill.

**19...Qxf3 20.Rhg1 Rf7 21.Kb1?!**

The new arrangement is unworkable for White to reach his goals.

He had to be consistent and try 21.Rxh6 .

**21...Qe3 22.Qd1 Ne7!**

When we set up a trap, we in essence want to be given a fortune, without the indignity of having to actually work for it.

**23.R6g4**

23.Rxh6?? is met with 23...f3! with a double threat of ...fxe2 and ...Qxh6.

**23...f3 24.R4g3?**

Now White's attacking lane is a clogged drain.

**24...Nf5!**

White loses heavy material.

SUMMARY: Respond to 4 Nge2 with 4...dxe4 and make White fight to regain the lost pawn.

**0-1**

### Balares,J. - Lakdawala,C. 11: San Diego (rapid), 2007

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.a3**

White is willing to expend a tempo, damage his pawn structure and temporarily offer e4, just to pick up the bishop pair.

**4...Bxc3+ 5.bxc3 dxe4**

WARNING: This move doesn't actually win a pawn, since White regains it on the next move with a double attack.

**6.Qg4**

White regains his pseudo-sacrificed pawn, at the cost of time and allowing Black an open g-file.

**6...Nf6 7.Qxg7 Rg8 8.Qh6 Nbd7**

Black leaves ...Rg6 in reserve.

**9.Ne2**

The idea is to play to g3 to dampen Black's power along the open g-file.

**9...c5**

9...b6 is played more often: 10.Ng3 Bb7 11.Be2 c5 is considered to be a position where Black achieves dynamic equality.

**10.Ng3**

Don't you hate it when you drive on a single lane road and the car ahead obstructs your progress with a contemptible law-abiding driver who has the colossal gall to observe the speed limit? White's blocks Black's pressure down the g-file.

**10...Qa5 11.Bd2 Qa4?!**

WARNING: Don't fall behind in development in an open position.

This move is based on the philosophy: those who dictate laws may also dispense with them. For many of us the opening stage has degenerated into a Pavlovian reflex, without actual thought. Its opposite problem is displayed by my last move, which represents misguided creativity in forcing a position which doesn't allow for it. This line is not one where we can afford to not live by the book. Black can't afford the waste of time involved.

11...b6 is correct.

**12.dxc5**

12.Qe3! Qxc2 13.Rc1 Qa4 14.Nxe4 is in White's favour.

**12...Qxc2**

With an air of self-destruction, I grab a pawn and waste time as calmly as inquiring about a slight shift in the weather. For a positional player like your writer to be here is similar to a scientist asking a poet about the geological properties of the California coastline.

**13.Bb5?!**

A key element in the art of knife throwing is that the knife should enter the target's body blade first.

13.Be2! Rg6 14.Qe3 Ne5 15.O-O , when White's development lead and bishop pair in the open position give him a clear advantage.

**13...Qb2! 14.Bxd7+**

White's miscalculation grounds to its painful conclusion, as he is forced to return the bishop pair.

**14...Bxd7 15.O-O Rg6 16.Qe3 Bc6 17.c4?! O-O-O?!**

After 17...Ng4! 18.Qc3 Qxc3 19.Bxc3 O-O-O Black has the better ending, due to White's isolated and crippled queenside pawns.

**18.Bc3 Qc2 19.Rac1 Qd3 20.Be5? Ng4! 21.Qf4 Nxe5**

At long last, I put my dark-square deficiency to rights.

**22.Qxe5 f5 23.Rc3?**

To walk along this path is to invite defeat.

23.Rcd1 Qxd1 24.Rxd1 Rxd1+ 25.Nf1 had to be tried.

**23...Qd2 24.Re3 Qd4!**

"Hi!" says Black's queen, in a bold conversational-opening gambit. Black removes White's only active piece, and the ending is lost for White.

**25.Qxd4 Rxd4**

Threat: ...f4.

**26.Rc3 Rd2 27.Re1 e3! 28.Rcxe3 f4 29.R3e2 Rxe2 30.Nxe2 Rxg2+ 31.Kf1 e5?!**

I should play 31...Rxh2! 32.Nxf4 Bf3! 33.Ne2 Bg2+! 34.Kg1 Rh1+ which wins.

**32.Nc3 Rg5 33.h4?! Rh5 34.Nd5 Rxh4! 35.f3 Rh1+ 36.Ke2 Rxe1+ 37.Kxe1 Kd7 38.Nf6+ Ke7!**

Avoiding the trap 38...Ke6? 39.Nxh7 Bxf3?? 40.Ng5+ .

**39.Nxh7 Bxf3 40.Ng5 Bc6 41.Ke2 Kf6**

SUMMARY: I have always found 4 a3 to be a dangerous and lip-bitingly tense line, since White forces open the game with the bishop pair. Black must rely on a development lead to counterbalance White's bishops.

**0-1**

### Tal,M. - Lein,A. 12: USSR Championship, Leningrad, 1971

DID YOU KNOW? Tal, despite a style bordering on madness, holds the two longest non-losing streaks in chess history.

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Bd3**

To me this line is illogical since White's bishop loses a tempo to the coming ...Nf6.

4.Qd3 is a close cousin to the line Tal played. Our strategy remains the same: 4...dxe4 5.Qxe4 Nf6 6.Qh4 , E.Sevillano-C.Lakdawala, San Diego 2006. Black can equalize any number of ways, the most dynamic of which may be 6...c5 7.dxc5 Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 Qa5 9.Qb4 Qc7 . I doubt that White's bishop pair means all that much when you look at those homely triplets on the c-file.

**4...dxe4**

The most logical move. Black soon gains a tempo.

**5.Bxe4 Nf6 6.Bg5**

If 6.Bf3 c5 7.Nge2 Nc6 8.a3 Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 e5! and Black stands no worse.

**6...Nbd7 7.Bf3 c5**

Lein chips away at Tal's central control.

**8.dxc5!?**

When we come up with a new move, we leave the comfort of scholarly citations and precedents, to a lonely place which only you have visited. Tal's move is no improvement, since it loses more time.

Better was 8.Nge2 .

**8...Qa5 9.Qd3?!**

It's odd to see a player who fails to conform to his own beliefs. It almost feels as if Tal deliberately courts disaster this game, by insisting on falling behind in development. There is a certain type of player who when he or she spots a norm, is immediately compelled to transgress it. Tal, who like Oscar Wilde, was able to resist anything but temptation itself, always held a deep aversion to the middle ground and is lured into a time-wasting idea.

Correct was the rather un-Tal like concession 9.Bd2 .

**9...Nxc5**

Thanks for the tempo!

**10.Qc4?!**

Placing the queen on the open c-file leads to more time lost when Black later plays ...Rc8.

10.Qd4 makes White's game slightly less miserable, which is really just backhanded praise, like saying: "You are the finest musician in your family," to a person who is the only musician in the family.

**10...Na4**

Black determines the availability of two plans and goes for the less effective one.

Lein, on the verge of a big upset, misses the slick idea 10...Nfe4! when White is losing.

**11.Bd2 Nd5?!**

Black reaps satisfying strategic profit from 11...Nxc3 12.bxc3 Bd6 when White's open b-file provides scant consolation when juxtaposed with his ugly queenside pawns.

**12.Nge2 O-O 13.a3?!**

More time lost.

White should try 13.O-O-O .

**13...Naxc3 14.Nxc3 Bxc3 15.bxc3 Bd7**

Black stands clearly better and Tal's victory can be attributed to the fact that he was Tal, rather than his good position.

**16.Qd4 Rac8 17.O-O Qa4 18.Rfc1 Bc6 19.Rab1 b6 20.c4 Ne7 21.Be2 Rfd8 22.Qf4 Ng6 23.Qe3 Bb7 24.Bc3 Qc6**

Threatening mate.

**25.Bf1 Ba6**

The c4 outlier is under heavy pressure.

**26.Rb4 Rd7**

White's game remains quite miserable after 26...e5! seizing control over the centre.

**27.Be2 Bb7 28.f3 Qc5 29.Qxc5 Rxc5 30.Rbb1 f6 31.Rd1 Rcc7**

Black's edge has slipped away.

Correct was 31...Rxd1+ 32.Rxd1 Rc8! 33.Rd7 Ba6 when Black is the one with all the winning chances.

**32.Rxd7 Rxd7 33.a4!**

Intending a5. Suddenly it isn't so clear if White's queenside pawns represent a deficiency or a virtue. Even in his youth, Tal wasn't your everyday prodigy/brat. He had a habit of swindling world champions (just ask Smyslov and Botvinnik!) from inferior positions, so it's no surprise that he steals a game he should have lost or drawn at best, versus a GM. Yet this time he does it in an uncharacteristically honest way, with excellent endgame technique.

**33...Kf7 34.Kf2 Nf4?!**

This planless move infringes upon Black's prime directive, which is to pressure c4.

Suddenly I prefer White. Black should target c4 with 34...Ne5! .

**35.Bf1 e5 36.a5 bxa5 37.Ra1 Rc7 38.Rxa5 Bc8 39.Bb4! Bf5?!**

39...Rd7! prevents Tal's coming plan.

**40.Bd6 Rb7 41.Rb5 Rb6 42.Bc5 Rc6 43.Bxa7 Ra6 44.Be3 Bxc2 45.Bxf4! exf4**

White's progress comes as softly as a priest's blessing. Black's kingside majority is crippled, while White's once sickly c4-pawn is dangerously passed.

**46.c5 Rc6 47.Bc4+ Ke7 48.Ke2**

ENDGAME PRINCIPLE: Don't hide your king in an ending. Use it.

**48...Rc7 49.Kd2 Ba4 50.Ra5 Bc6 51.Kc3 g5 52.Ra2 h5 53.Re2+! Kf8?**

You may not actually commit the crime, yet still be guilty of being criminally complicit. Black saves his useless f6-pawn at the cost of decentralizing his king.

He had to try 53...Kd8 54.Re6 Bd7 55.Rxf6 Rxc5 56.Kd4 Ra5 .

**54.Re6 Kg7 55.Kd4 Rd7+ 56.Rd6 Rc7 57.Bd5**

Breaking down the blockade.

**57...Bxd5 58.Kxd5 Re7 59.c6 Re5+ 60.Kc4 Re1 61.Rd3!**

White meets a rook check on c1 with a block on c3.

SUMMARY: Both 4.Bd3 and 4.Qd3 fly in the face of historic trends, and can be effectively met with 4...dxe4 and 5...Nf6, gaining a tempo for Black.<level/><level start="5...Nf6" value="-1"/>

**1-0**

### Timman,J. - Vaganian,R. 13: Amsterdam, 1986

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Bd2**

TIP: This dangerous line is a pawn sacrifice from White, which I would advise dodging.

**4...Ne7**

Black continues cautiously as if a distant threat is now imminent.

4...dxe4 5.Qg4 Qxd4 6.O-O-O may actually favour Black, if you ask the comps. For us humans, White's development lead looks rather dangerous.

**5.Bd3!?**

Just because a move defies reason, doesn't automatically qualify it as an error. White offers a rather speculative pawn sacrifice, and then follows it with a second one.

Otherwise: 5.Qg4 is safely met by 5...O-O .

5.e5 c5 transposes to a position we looked at in the previous chapter.

**5...dxe4 6.Nxe4 Qxd4**

Well, Bobby Fischer did say that a pawn is worth a bit of trouble. In this case Black is only one move from castling, so the grab is quite justified.

**7.Nf3!?**

Timman continues with unremitting hostility, offering a second pawn, rather than backing down with 7.Nc3 which to an attacker is a bit like turning a five star hotel into a monastery. Cavier/champagne and austerity measures don't mix well.

**7...Bxd2+ 8.Qxd2 Qd5?!**

Excess apprehension has a way of hampering our otherwise sound plan. Black's last move is made with the thought: if you don't start a fight, you can't lose one either. Yet, I argue: if you are going to be greedy, then be consistent about it. Black digests the choices before him and incorrectly declines White's second gift.

He should accept with 8...Qxb2! . White's attack has all the spurious markings of a slightly unsound attack, for two reasons:

1. The move deprives White of queenside castling.

2. Black is now up two pawns, and although I never was very good in maths, I'm almost certain that two is a higher (and therefore better!) number than one. I don't believe in White's full compensation for two pawns after 9.O-O Nbc6 10.Qg5 Ng6 .

**9.O-O-O**

Now White gets a scary-looking development lead for the pawn.

**9...Nbc6**

Wise, as a2 is poisoned: 9...Qxa2?? allows 10.Bb5+ and the problem is 10...Nbc6 11.Qd8# !

**10.Qc3 f6**

Blunting the white queen's influence, while preparing ...e5.

**11.a3**

White finally covers the hanging a2-pawn.

**11...e5?**

Premature. This move gravely weakens the light squares.

Black looks okay after 11...Qa5 when we feel an easing of tension in Black's position, similar to the release of pent up breath.

**12.Nc5!**

Black's queen is in danger of discovered checks from White's bishop.

**12...Qf7 13.Bc4**

Suddenly White's forces hum with menace. Black's king is now stuck in the centre and Vaganian's position is overtaxed on the weak light squares.

**13...Qg6 14.Rd2 Qxg2!?**

WARNING: Don't create confrontation or open the position when lagging in development.

Correct was 14...Rb8 .

**15.Rg1 Qh3 16.Rxg7 Qh6 17.Rg1 b6 18.Ne4 Bd7?!**

18...Rf8 was necessary.

**19.Qe3! Qf8**

White's last move forced this stilted response.

After 19...Qxe3?? 20.Nxf6+ Kd8 21.fxe3 Black's pinned bishop is lost.

**20.Rgd1 Nf5 21.Qe2 Ncd4**

21...O-O-O is met with 22.Ba6+ Kb8 23.Rxd7 winning a piece.

**22.Nxd4 Nxd4**

EXERCISE (combination alert): How does White continue his attack?

ANSWER: Clearance/annihilation of defensive barrier. This sacrifice enables a deadly discovered check next move.

**23.Rxd4!**

The phrase "There's more where that came from" is inapplicable in a sacrificial attack since on the chess board our resources are finite. Yet to Black, it surely must have felt the opposite.

**23...exd4 24.Nd6+ Kd8**

The silence in the room gets awkward when Black's terrified king unburdens the contents of his bladder and bowels on the floor.

**25.Nf7+ Kc8 26.Qf3! Kb8 27.Rxd4 Qc5 28.Rxd7 Rg8 29.Ba6**

SUMMARY: 4 Bd2 is a dangerous sacrificial line, which I would meet with the cautious 4...Ne7.

**1-0**

## 3: The Classical Variation

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6**

The strategic challenges of the Classical Variation can feel like looking into the cavernous mouth of a pitch black cave.

**4.--**

In the position Black's knight taunts White into 4.e5 , resolving the central tension, allowing White a significant space advantage after an f4 follow up. At first it can feel like the black pieces walk under water, but the Classical isn't a one way conversation, with White doing all the talking, so don't underestimate Black's counterattacking resources.

As always, we hit back at White's giant centre with ...c5, ...Nc6 and possibly...Qb6 in some cases. When ...cxd4 occurs, the fight begins in earnest for the d4-square, when Black can even play ...Bc5. Black's developmental issues: how to activate the c8-bishop and the d7-knight? The bishop can be activated in two ways:

1. By playing ...a6, ...b5, ...b4, ...a5, and then the bishop, suddenly infused with significance, emerges on a6 to swap itself away for White's dangerous light-squared bishop.

2. Black can play ...f6 and if exf6, then ...Nxf6, when we take on a backward e6-pawn. In this case the undeveloped c8-bishop slithers to relevance via d7, e8 and then finally on to an active diagonal with ...Bg6 or ...Bh5, where it issues an imperious challenge to the white pieces.

Black's d7-knight may later go back to f6 after ...f6; exf6 Nxf6, or, if the players castle on opposite wings, Black's knight can lunge directly at White's king after ...cxd4 and ...Nc5.

White's alternative strategy to Black's 3...Nf6 is to maintain pawn tension, for at least one more move with 4.Bg5 , which leads to the unbalanced McCutcheon Variation, 4...Bb4 , where Black ignores White's 'threat' of e5. Here we walk a narrow line, where with even a single step off the theoretical path, our grand narrative can be unceremoniously dismantled by a single idea.

4 Bg5 can also lead to several other lines like 4...dxe4 , a Rubinstein hybrid,

and 4...Be7 , which allows White 5.e5 and Bxe7, leaving Black with the issue of a remaining bad bishop.

Our goals as Black in the Classical are well defined:

1. Fight for the d4-square.

2. Counterattack White's giant centre with ...c5 and sometimes ...f6.

3. Find a way to activate the bad light-squared c8-bishop.

4. Keep our king safe.

If we succeed in these goals, we can be certain to emerge with a healthy middlegame position, with dynamically balanced chances.

### Steinitz,W. - Sellman,A. 14: Baltimore, 1885

"Please do not be disappointed by the relative weakness of Black's play - to some extent it helped Steinitz to demonstrate the essence of his plan in the purest form," writes Garry Kasparov. A copy is rarely clearer than the original. This game is one of the earliest of this variation in the database. When I first played this game over at the age of nine, I swooned in an epiphanic moment when I discovered the secret of weak squares of a single colour.

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6**

Black develops his knight, while seeking to create a central resolution with either 4 exd5, or 4 e5.

**4.e5**

DID YOU KNOW? Thus spake Steinitz. This game, a strategic masterpiece, left such a deep impression on the chess world, that the line is to this day called the Steinitz Variation. White seizes useful central space, while gaining a tempo on Black's knight.

**4...Nfd7 5.f4**

White continues to expand on the kingside.

**5...c5 6.dxc5?!**

NOTE: Avoid making non-developing moves which help your opponent's development.

I love annotating games from the Great Romantics, since the jokes write themselves. Even the greats bungle it from time to time. I read that the Irish poet William Butler Yeats once blew an academic job application when he misspelled the word "professor", the job for which he applied! This unnecessary concession benefits Black's development.

Next game we look at White's modern interpretation 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3 .

**6...Bxc5**

Black's bishop cuts through the central dark squares and makes it difficult for White to castling kingside.

**7.Nf3 a6**

Black misplaces priorities.

After 7...Nc6 8.Bd3 f6! the immediate central counter gives Black an excellent position.

WARNING: Be careful to avoid the Greek Gift sacrificial theme, which goes like this 8...O-O?? 9.Bxh7+! Kxh7 10.Ng5+ Kg6 (unfortunately for Black, playing the king to g8 is even worse, since it allows the deadly Qh5) 11.Qd3+ f5 12.Qg3 with a nasty attack for White.

**8.Bd3 Nc6 9.Qe2 Nb4?!**

WARNING: Avoid early adventures like this where you are tempted to move an already developed piece.

This move is dubious for the following reasons:

1. Black wastes time.

2. Black weakens his control over the key d4-square - a factor for which he later dearly pays.

**10.Bd2 b5 11.Nd1 Nxd3+ 12.cxd3!**

This move opens the c-file, while ensuring that Black's knight won't be able to roost one day on e4 or c4.

**12...Qb6?!**

Black can prevent Steinitz's coming plan with 12...b4! , intending to activate his bad bishop with ...a5 and ...Ba6.

**13.b4!**

NOTE: In the Classical French, both sides should fight to seize control over the d4-square.

**13...Be7 14.a3**

Securing b4, in preparation for Be3.

**14...f5?**

WARNING: Be careful about playing ...f5, since then Black renounces all ...f6-based kingside play, the repercussions of which prove catastrophic.

Black should play 14...d4! 15.Nf2 O-O 16.Ne4 Bb7 , not worrying if his d4-pawn falls later on.

**15.Rc1 Bb7**

When we feed an incorrect plan, we subsidize a fiction. Black is still oblivious to the importance of the d4-square.

15...d4 is met with 16.Qf2 winning d4 without compensation, which I think is still better for Black than what happened in the game.

**16.Be3**

White takes ownership of d4. White's idea finally reaches the point of articulation, and there is no way for Black to extricate himself from strategic poverty.

**16...Qd8 17.Nd4**

Just look at the difference between White's knight and Black's awful light-squared bishop.

**17...Nf8**

The knight is forced into indenture in service of e6.

**18.O-O h5?!**

WARNING: To have a deviation, one must first begin with a norm, which many players in this era lacked.

Black's plan has a future, the way a mass murderer with ten consecutive life sentences has one as well. Black's move is in violation of Steinitz' principle: avoid unnecessary or weakening pawn moves. Black's idea is to prevent g4. What he failed to grasp was that Steinitz had no intention of attacking on the kingside.

**19.Nc3 Kf7 20.Nb1!**

Intending Nd2 and Nb3, when White increases his grip on the queenside dark squares.

**20...g6 21.Nd2 Nd7 22.N2b3 Rc8**

Notice that Black doesn't have ...Nb6 and ...Nc4, due to Steinitz' farsighted move 12 cxd3.

**23.Na5 Ba8 24.Rxc8 Qxc8 25.Rc1 Qb8 26.Qc2**

White seizes control over the only open file.

**26...Bd8 27.Nac6! Qb7**

Black can't rid himself of his bad bishop with 27...Bxc6? , since doing so enables decisive infiltration after 28.Qxc6 Nf8 29.Qxa6 and b5 falls as well.

**28.Nxd8+**

Clearing the path to c7.

**28...Rxd8 29.Qc7 Qb8 30.Bf2!**

TIP: Use all your pieces.

Steinitz methodically brings into play his only ineffective piece, threatening Bh4.

**30...Qb6 31.Nf3**

Order and obedience are the driving principles of the totalitarian state.

White can actually play the paradoxical 31.Bh4! Qxd4+ (the white knight's Jimmy Hoffa-like disappearance baffles the authorities, but not White's king) 32.Kh1 Qb6 33.Bxd8 , winning.

**31...Qxc7 32.Rxc7 Ke8**

Come all ye faithful. One by one, Black's pieces have been ceremoniously ushered to the first rank.

**33.Ng5 Nf8 34.Bc5**

Threatening mate on the move. "Don't hate me. I am merely obeying the law of natural selection," the bishop tells Black's king. White threatens mate and Black's position bursts asunder.

**34...Nd7 35.Bd6**

SUMMARY: Remember to fight for the crucial d4-square, while fighting too for the dark squares in the Steinitz Variation.

**1-0**

### Caruana,F. - Nakamura,H. 15: Saint Louis (rapid), 2015

DID YOU KNOW? American super-GMs Fabiano Caruana and Hikaru Nakamura are both considered potential challengers for Magnus Carlsen's world championship crown.

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3**

Caruana improves upon Steinitz' lame capture on c5.

**6...Nc6 7.Be3**

The fight is on for control over d4.

**7...Be7**

Black chooses to develop rapidly.

Also played here are the lines 7...a6

7...cxd4

and 7...Qb6 .

**8.Qd2 a6**

Black prepares queenside expansion with ...b5, which discourages White from castling on that side.

8...O-O is also played, but Nakamura doesn't want to commit to early kingside castling, which may allow White an early attack.

**9.Bd3 b5 10.O-O Qb6**

Why not gain a tempo with 10...c4 - ?

WARNING: It's a dangerous business for Black to play ...c4 in many French lines, since this takes pressure off White's centre and enables a kingside attack.

**11.dxc5**

Clearing the d4-square.

**11...Bxc5 12.Bxc5 Nxc5 13.Qf2**

Just like last game, the fight for d4 begins.

**13...Nd7**

It's not easy to get the timing right of when to be cautious and when to be daring. In positions of crisis, all which concerns us is the immediate and the tangible (Black's king safety). Abstract notions of future suffering in the ending to come, don't seem to matter as much. Nakamura is understandably anxious to remove queens from the board to safeguard his king.

Riskier is 13...b4 14.Ne2 a5 15.Ned4 . The fact that queens remain on the board is of some concern for Black's insecure king.

**14.a3 Ke7!**

Queens are coming off the board, so Nakamura plays on the Steinitz principle: use your king as a fighting piece in the ending - don't hide it in a corner.

**15.Qxb6 Nxb6 16.Ne2**

Now d4 is firmly in White's grip and he holds a minimal endgame edge.

**16...Bd7 17.b3**

Denying Black's knight use of a4 and c4.

**17...f6!?**

This attempt at confrontation looks a tad premature to me.

**18.Ned4**

White's knights seize control over d4 and signal that they are the new lords of the manor.

**18...Nxd4 19.Nxd4 fxe5 20.fxe5 h6 21.Kf2!**

Caruana also makes use of his king in the ending to bolster control over the dark squares.

**21...Rhf8+ 22.Ke3 Rxf1 23.Rxf1 Be8**

White has all the winning chances in the line 23...Rf8 24.Rxf8 Kxf8 25.Kd2! when White's king travels the queenside dark squares, via c3 and b4.

**24.Bh7**

Intending Bg8.

**24...Bf7 25.Nc6+! Ke8 26.Bd3 Rc8 27.Nb4 Nd7**

Black challenges e5.

**28.Kd4**

Now that is what I call a king!

**28...Nb8**

EXERCISE (combination alert): It appears as if making progress for White is like chewing a cheap, undercooked, tough cut of meat. However, White has access to a hidden tactic which wins a pawn. How?

ANSWER: Undermining/attraction/double attack.

**29.Nxa6! Nc6+**

After 29...Nxa6 30.Bxb5+ Ke7 31.Bxa6 Rxc2 32.Rg1 White's two queenside passers should be decisive, despite Black's active rook.

**30.Kc5!**

TIP: Don't be afraid of ghosts. Black's discovered check on e5 isn't so scary for White.

**30...Ke7 31.Kxb5 Nxe5**

The ending becomes a battle between White's queenside passers versus Black's central passed pawn.

**32.Kb6 Be8 33.a4 Kd6 34.Rf2**

Covering his second rank.

**34...Nxd3 35.cxd3 Bg6**

NOTE: The much maligned 'bad' light-squared bishop often later turns out to be an excellent piece when it escapes the confines of its structure, and is promoted to the level of a first tier minor piece, as in this case.

**36.d4 e5!**

Nobody wants to wait in a long line at the DMV, just for the fun of it. Nakamura generates dangerous counterplay via his soon to be passed d-pawn.

**37.dxe5+ Kxe5 38.b4 d4 39.b5**

The queenside passers trail their king like baby geese with their mother.

**39...d3 40.Nb4 Kd4!**

Both sides are clearly advocates of Steinitz's principle of utilizing the king in the ending.

**41.Nc6+ Ke3 42.Rf3+ Ke2 43.Nd4+ Ke1?**

WARNING: Don't overpress for the win, when the position says otherwise.

Dr. Sigmund Lakdawala offers some advice: that which we can't have is so much more alluring than that which we can easily attain, and temptation is that disembodied voice which whispers sweet promissory lies into our ear. Perhaps this is a misguided attempt to play for a win. The ancient Greek scholar Ptolemy theorized that the earth was round, and also the centre of the universe, so he only got it half right. In chess, getting a plan half right generally leads to painful results.

Black's best chance of holding the game lay in 43...Kd2! 44.a5 Be4 .

**44.Rg3 Be4**

44...d2?? 45.Nf3+ Ke2 46.Nxd2 is hopeless for Black.

**45.Re3+ Kf1**

Black's king continues to shuttlecock in a desperate bid to promote his d-pawn.

**46.Rxe4!**

Caruana correctly accepts the bribe.

**46...d2**

EXERCISE (combination alert): It appears as if Black's d-pawn has slipped away from the white defender's orbit, but this just isn't the case. It's one of Caissa the chess goddess' cruelties that she sometimes allows us to resist bravely, come close, and then lose anyway. How did White prevent Black's promotion to a new queen?

ANSWER: Knight fork. This is the point where the reporter from the 1930's movie rushes into the editor's office and breathlessly declares: "Stop the presses!".

**47.Nf5! Rc3**

The heir-apparent d-pawn isn't going to inherit a damn thing.

47...d1=Q is met with 48.Ne3+ Ke2 49.Nxd1+ when Black only got to keep his new queen for two moves.

**48.Rd4 Ke1 49.a5 g6**

If 49...d1=Q (such moves are played more for cathartic release, than actual benefit to our position) 50.Rxd1+ Kxd1 51.a6 and Black's rook is incapable of halting White's queenside passers.

**50.Nd6**

SUMMARY: If White swaps off the dark-squared bishops and queens, he or she often emerges with a slight edge in the ending, due to extra central territory and use of the d4-square.

**1-0**

### Smirin,I. - Vallejo Pons,F. 16: Nakhchivan, 2011

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.Nce2**

This move - which almost feels outside the context of the French Defence - is made with the philosophy: it's a mistake to allow ourselves to be imprisoned by the conventional. This odd move appears as the person who eats an apple with a knife and fork; it's just easier if you pick it up and take a bite.

NOTE: With this convoluted move, it appears as if White violates the principle: don't move the same piece twice in the opening without reason. However, he does indeed have a good reason: White clears the c3-square, enabling him to meet ...c5 with c3.

This means that if Black plays ...cxd4, White can then recapture with a pawn, which reinforces e5, while denying Black's pieces use of c5. The obvious issue with White's move is that it loses time.

**5...c5 6.f4**

Normally, the move order is 6.c3 Nc6 which allows White recapture on d4 with a pawn.

**6...Nc6**

Vallejo prefers to remain within the main lines rather than veer with 6...cxd4 . The trouble with this move is that it helps White untangle: 7.Nxd4 Nc6 8.Ngf3 .

**7.c3**

NOTE: In this version, White intends to back up his d4-square with pawns, not pieces.

This means he will probably respond to a future ...cxd4 with cxd4.

**7...b5**

TIP: Undermine the opponent's pawn chain at its base, not its head. Black takes advantage of the fact that White's bishop no longer controls b5. Black intends to undermine White's pawn chain at its lowest link with a coming ...b4.

7...Qb6 is Black's main move here.

**8.Nf3 b4 9.f5!?**

White does his own undermining, offering a pawn to destabilize Black's centre, while clearing f4 for his pieces.

The slow 9.g3?! is White's main move, but it doesn't do very well after 9...bxc3 10.bxc3 .

**9...exf5 10.Nf4**

Pressuring d5. White's once hemmed in pieces finally achieve autonomy of their structural hindrances.

**10...bxc3 11.bxc3 Rb8**

Black offers to return the pawn to gain time.

**12.Qa4!?**

White refuses to settle for dynamic equality with 12.Nxd5 cxd4 and only then play 13.Qa4 Bb7 14.Bb5 .

**12...Nb6!**

A shocker. White's queen is trapped if he takes c6.

**13.Qxc6+!?**

Hey, I just said: "White's queen is trapped if he takes c6". One senses that teamwork isn't the queen's strongest trait. Disreputable motives are rarely approached with a forethought of decorum, and the devious rogue is a more attractive literary character than the honest citizen.

**13...Bd7 14.Bb5 Be7**

When a rival places an offer on the bargaining table, our first reaction is to doubt his sincerity. Vallejo cautiously declines the immediate acceptance and attempts to inject a dose of normalcy into an otherwise confused situation. This is one of those multi-tiered situations of an actor who plays the role of an actor, within a play. Immediate acceptance is risky.

14...Bxc6!? 15.Bxc6+ Ke7 16.dxc5 leaves Black's king dangerously exposed in the middle.

**15.dxc5 O-O**

Understandable caution.

The line 15...Bxc6!? 16.Bxc6+ Nd7 17.e6 looks awfully scary for Black.

**16.cxb6 Bxc6 17.Bxc6 Rxb6 18.Ba4!**

18.Bxd5? loses a piece to 18...g5! .

**18...d4!**

Following the principle: create confrontation when leading in development.

**19.O-O!**

Wisely running for cover;

19.Nxd4? Rb4!! 20.Bc2 Rxd4 21.cxd4 Qxd4 22.Rb1 Qc3+ and Black wins, since White's king can't afford to help his bishop out with Kd1, due to a rook check on the d-file.

19.cxd4? Bb4+ 20.Kf2 Bc3 sees Black win material.

**19...dxc3 20.Rd1 Bc5+ 21.Kh1 Qc8**

Black removes his queen from attack along the d-file, while covering e6 ideas from White.

**22.Nd5 h6!?**

This game is full of contradictory features. Vallejo is willing to widen the material inequality by handing over an exchange to rid himself of White's most active piece.

**23.Nxc3!?**

Which White declines!

23.Nxb6 axb6 24.h4 f4! , and if 25.Bxf4?? Qg4! when Black wins a piece back.

**23...Rd8 24.Rxd8+ Qxd8 25.Bb3 Qd3 26.Bb2 Rxb3!**

Removing White's most effective piece. In this game both sides play with an almost spiritual contempt for material, while openly flouting conventional conduct.

**27.axb3 Qc2**

Defence of b2 and c3 grow awkward for White.

**28.Na4 Be3 29.b4 g5!**

Black's territorial acquisition gives him elevated rank on the kingside. On paper White has plenty for the queen, yet his pieces are clumsy and lack targets, while Black can prepare a kingside attack. So White's extra material turns out to be oddly inconsequential.

**30.Bd4 f4 31.h3 h5 32.Nc5 g4 33.Ne1 Qf5 34.Bxe3 fxe3 35.Ned3 gxh3 36.Rg1 hxg2+ 37.Rxg2+ Kf8 38.Rg3?**

White may hold a draw if he plays 38.Kh2! and then just waits.

**38...e2 39.Re3 h4 40.Kh2**

40.Rxe2?? hangs the rook to 40...Qf1+ .

**40...Qg5! 41.Nd7+!**

Playing for a geometric aberration is our best chance if we are losing anyway. With his last move White sets up a devilish trap.

He correctly avoids 41.Rxe2?? Qg3+ 42.Kh1 Qf3+ 43.Rg2 h3 and the rook is lost.

**41...Kg7 42.Rxe2 Qg3+ 43.Kh1**

EXERCISE (critical decision): Black's queen can win either knight. Should Black play 43...Qxd3, or should he first give check with 43...Qh3+ and then play 44...Qxd7 - ?<addz start="44...Qxd7"/>

ANSWER:

**43...Qh3+!**

Black avoids a devious trap and correctly takes the d7-knight.

WARNING: When we are winning, the most dangerous state of mind to arise is one of self-congratulation. It's a huge mistake to avoid looking at a position from our opponent's perspective, and an illusion to believe that we are the sole agents in our destiny, since Caissa had the poor taste to invent anomalies, which play havoc on our intended geometry.

The blunder 43...Qxd3?? allows White to escape with a draw after 44.Rg2+ Kh6 45.Nf6! . Some combinations have the feel of a lucky accident, when in reality they are a wilful construct of mind, as in this case: 45...Qf1+ 46.Kh2 Qf4+ 47.Kh3 Qxb4

(47...Qxe5?? 48.Ng4+ forks king and queen)

48.Ng8+ Kh5 49.Nf6+ Kh6 50.Ng8+ with perpetual check, since Black is unable to play 50...Kh7 51.Nf6+ Kh8?? 52.Rg8# .

**44.Kg1 Qxd7 45.Nf2 Qf5 46.Re4 Qf3 47.Kf1**

47.Rxh4?? hangs the rook to 47...Qg3+ .

**47...h3**

The h-pawn eventually costs White a piece.

**48.Rg4+ Kf8 49.Rh4 Qg2+ 50.Ke2 h2 51.Rh5 Kg7! 52.Rh4**

EXERCISE (combination alert): How does Black win more material?

ANSWER: Removal of the guard.

**52...Qg3! 53.Re4**

Instead, 53.Rh3 is met by 53...Qxh3! 54.Nxh3 h1=Q

while if 53.Rh5 Kg6 and White's rook runs out of squares since 54.Rh8 Qxe5+ picks up the rook.

**53...Qxf2+!**

Black removes the only defender of the promotion square, winning another piece.

SUMMARY: The French word 'volu', which translates to 'overly contrived', is my impression of the 5 Nce2 plan. White contorts and loses time to back up his d4 point with c3. In my opinion Black's gain of time easily equals White's potentially powerful pawn centre.

**0-1**

### Gashimov,V. - Carlsen,M. 17: Monaco (rapid), 2011

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5**

In this version White retains the pawn tension, while developing with a pin.

**4...dxe4**

NOTE: With Black's last move, the position transposed to a line of the Rubinstein, but I think one more favourable for Black than in the Rubinstein proper, since the inclusion of Bg5 helps Black. Why? Because after Black plays ...Be7, White will either be forced to swap pieces, or back down and lose time. And since Black is cramped, each swap is helpful.

In the next few games we look at 4...Bb4

and 4...Be7 .

**5.Nxe4 Be7**

5...Nbd7 is played less often: 6.Nf3 Be7 7.Nxf6+ Bxf6 8.h4 O-O 9.Bd3 c5 10.Qe2 cxd4 11.Qe4 g6 12.O-O-O . The comp calls the game even, while I like White's development lead and attacking chances, G.Kasparov-V.Anand, Kopavogur (rapid) 2000.

**6.Bxf6**

This is White's only shot at an edge.

6.Nxf6+ Bxf6 7.Bxf6 Qxf6 is too tame to produce an advantage for White.

**6...gxf6**

NOTE: Don't be afraid to recapture on f6 with a pawn, which is Black's most dynamic move, where he agrees to structural damage, for the bishop pair, an open g-file and increased central influence. In my opinion, not such a bad deal for Black.

6...Bxf6 7.Nf3 O-O 8.Qd2 Nd7 9.O-O-O also leads to a sharp position with opposite castling.

**7.Nf3 f5**

7...b6

and 7...a6 are also played here.

**8.Ng3**

The alternative is to play 8.Nc3 hoping to achieve a future d5 break: 8...a6 9.g3 b5 10.Bg2 Bb7 11.O-O O-O and I would be happy to take on Black's position.

TIP: Black often castles kingside in this line, despite the broken structure. The reason: he has an unopposed dark-squared bishop which keeps his king safer than it appears.

**8...c5!?**

Such moves usually lead to glory or oblivion, but rarely anything in between. This move follows the principle: open the position when you have the bishop pair; yet violates the principle: avoid confrontation when lagging in development.

**9.Bb5+ Bd7 10.Bxd7+ Qxd7 11.d5!?**

It's impossible to be cordial with an opponent who lives in a constant state of resentment. A sacrifice like this doesn't require empirical verification. It just feels right to the GM, who relies on his development lead, coupled with Black's weakened structure.

**11...exd5 12.Ne5 Qe6**

Black's queen begins to dance the flamenco, while White attempts duplicitous nitpickings in the middle.

**13.f4 Nd7 14.O-O O-O-O**

Black would be unwise to open lines with 14...Nxe5!? 15.fxe5 and now 15...Qxe5?? would be suicidal.

WARNING: Fight the temptation to grab pawns in an open position, at the cost of your development.

After 16.Nxf5 (threat: Nxe7 and Re1) 16...Kf8 17.Qh5 White has a winning attack.

Possible, though, is 14...Nf6 15.Qd3 c4 16.Qxf5 h5 17.Rae1 h4 18.Ng6! Qb6+ 19.Kh1 fxg6 20.Qxg6+ Kd8 21.Nf5 Bc5 , which is nightmarishly complicated and unhelpfully rated even by the comp.

**15.Qh5 Nxe5 16.fxe5 Qxe5 17.Rae1 Qd4+ 18.Kh1**

White is down two pawns, yet understands he will win them back, since Black's f-pawns are chronically weak.

**18...Qh4!**

Carlsen's annoying queen is the person who starts to talk to you when you are waiting for the bus, just when you want to be left alone.

**19.Rxf5**

19.Qxf7? Bd6 is in Black's favour.

**19...Qxh5 20.Nxh5 Rd7 21.Rxf7 Bd8 22.Rf5 b6 23.Nf4 d4**

In this ending:

1. We have opposing wing pawn majorities.

2. White pieces are more aggressively placed.

3. Black's bishop has the potential to be the superior minor piece, especially with opposite wing majorities.

**24.b3**

Restraining Black's majority.

**24...Bc7 25.Nd3 Rg8 26.g3 Rg6 27.Kg2 Rc6!**

Playing for ...c4.

**28.Re2!?**

Sometimes we take a predictably risky course if the alternative is death via passivity.

Most strong players don't consider passive defence with concessions like 28.Nb2 .

**28...c4 29.bxc4 Rxc4**

Now White's queenside pawns are vulnerable.

**30.Rh5 Ra4 31.Nc1 Kb7 32.Rd2 a6 33.Rh4 Bd8 34.Rh5 b5 35.Nb3?!**

This does little to abate White's anxiety.

35.Re2 is White's best shot to hold the game, when Black's progress is by no means inevitable.

**35...Bb6 36.c3?!**

This idea contains a glaring inconsistency, in that it speeds Black's pawn promotion efforts. He probably should forego this embellishment and drop his knight back to c1.

**36...d3 37.Nc1 Ba5! 38.Rxd3 Rxd3 39.Nxd3 Rxa2+ 40.Kf3 Bxc3 41.Rxh7+**

So material is even, but the game isn't. The tangible fruits of Carlsen's labours:

1. Black's pawns look slightly faster.

2. Black's bishop works defensively and offensively, while White's short range knight can only achieve one or the other.

**41...Kc6 42.g4 b4 43.g5 b3 44.g6**

EXERCISE (planning): We must navigate this position as carefully as a person crossing a forceful stream, by stepping on stones until reaching the other side. Should Black win a piece with 44...b2, or does he have something better, which rules White's argument invalid?

ANSWER: Attraction/removal of a key defender.

**44...Rd2!**

The most untrustworthy person in the world is the one who declines your honest bribe. Carlsen rejects winning the piece and lures White's king away from g2, after which Black places his rook behind White's passed g-pawn.

He correctly rejected 44...b2? , reasoning that the question isn't even worth raising: 45.Nxb2 Rxb2 46.h4 isn't so clear.

**45.Ke3 Rg2 46.Rh6**

When desperate, we note to our chagrin, a histrionic quality to our moves. This plan leaves nothing but a void at its heart, but everything else lost as well.

**46...Bd2+!**

The bishop greets White's king like our tail-wagging dog when we return home.

**47.Kf3 Bxh6 48.Kxg2 a5**

White's passers are halted, while Black's roll.

**49.Nb2 Kb5**

SUMMARY: 4...dxe4 leads to a type of Rubinstein, but I think a superior one for Black when compared to the main line version.

**0-1**

### Rabiega,R. - Vitiugov,N. 18: German League, 2009

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Bb4**

This leads to the unbalanced McCutcheon Variation, where Black ignores White's 'threat' to play e5 on the pinned f6-knight. It's a hair-trigger line which risks calamitous consequences for both sides if mishandled.

**5.e5 h6**

Black counterattacks.

**6.Bd2**

Alternatively: 6.Be3 is also gaining in popularity: 6...Ne4 7.Qg4 g6

(7...Kf8 is also played here; Black refuses to weaken, at the cost of hemming in the h8-rook)

8.a3 Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 c5 10.Bd3 h5 11.Qf4 g5! 12.Qf3 Nxc3 13.dxc5 . White's bishop pair and dark-square potential compensate for the tattered structure.

6.exf6 hxg5 7.fxg7 Rg8 and Black will regain the pawn, while picking up the bishop pair.

6.Bc1!? (the idea behind this eccentric looking move is that White's bishop may later emerge on a3) 6...Ne4 7.Qg4 Kf8 8.Nge2 c5 9.a3 Ba5 10.dxc5 Nxc3 11.Nxc3 Bxc3+ 12.bxc3 Qc7 . Once again White's bishop pair and dark-square potential make up for the god-awful structure.

6.Bh4 g5 7.Bg3 Ne4 8.Nge2 f5! and Black stands no worse.

**6...Bxc3**

In this way Black gets his knight to e4, its best post.

**7.bxc3!**

NOTE: Don't be afraid to self-damage your structure. It's known that recapturing on c3 with the bishop gives White nothing after 7.Bxc3 Ne4 8.Bb4 c5! 9.Bxc5 Nxc5 10.dxc5 Qa5+ 11.c3 Qxc5 with approximate equality.

**7...Ne4 8.Qg4 Kf8**

NOTE: This voluntary king move displays a mischief-making quality; Black refuses to weaken his kingside dark squares. The cost? His h8-rook languishes out of play.

8...g6 is the main line: 9.Bd3 Nxd2 10.Kxd2 c5 11.Nf3 Nc6 12.Qf4 Qa5 13.dxc5 Qxc5 when White's space and attacking chances are tempered by his inferior queenside structure.

**9.Qf4!?**

The main line runs 9.Bd3 Nxd2 10.Kxd2 c5 11.h4 Nc6 12.Rh3 c4 13.Be2 . Black will play for a break on b4, with ...b5, ...a5, ...Rb8 and ...b4, while White plays directly for mate on the kingside.

**9...c5 10.Bd3 Nxd2 11.Qxd2?!**

One digression stumbles upon another, as White willingly deconstructs his own intent. The McCutcheon is no place to get spooked when duty calls. This is a waste of resources, like the farmer who attempts to seed the ocean for crops. White didn't lose castling rights in this version, but he played too passively to claim an edge. Now the attack loses some of its gusto from its previous enriched form. To pick one path implies exclusion of the other. It's often a mistake to mix the two, in the hopes of getting a little bit of the best from each one.

I don't like this overly cautious version, after which White's kingside attack remains an embryonic work in progress rather than an actuality, since his queen is removed from the kingside, which lessens Black's defensive burden. White should keep his queen where she stands and risk 11.Kxd2 c4 12.Be2 Nc6 13.h4 with chances for both sides.

**11...Qa5 12.Nf3 c4**

Black closes the queenside, fixing White's pawns as targets.

**13.Be2 Nd7**

NOTE: Why play the knight to d7 when the more central square c6 is available?

The answer: Black's plan is to invade the queenside and pick off pawns with ...Nb6, ...Qb2 and ...Na4, when the a2- and c3-pawns are under heavy assault. Of course this is all under the assumption that Black's king won't be mated in the meanwhile!

**14.h4 Qa3 15.Rh3**

White lifts his rook into a potential kingside attack, while indirectly reinforcing c3.

**15...Qb2 16.Rc1**

Just as in my game against Khachian from Chapter One, White offers his a-pawn.

**16...Nb6 17.h5 Bd7 18.Nh4**

Now c3 is secure.

**18...Na4 19.f4**

White intends to pry open the kingside with f5 at some point.

**19...b5 20.Bg4 Ke8!**

TIP: A common strategy for Black in the ...Kf8 McCutcheon is to later walk the king over to the safety of the queenside.

**21.f5 Kd8 22.Rf3 a5**

The coming ...b4 is a serious issue for White.

**23.fxe6 fxe6 24.Ng6 Re8 25.Nf4?!**

Now White's kingside play is the computer on sleep mode.

White should try 25.Rf7 Qxc3 26.Qxc3 Nxc3 27.Ra1 b4 28.Rxg7 and now Black can either risk playing for a win with ...a4, or force a repetition draw with 28...Nb5 29.Rd1 Nc3 30.Ra1 Nb5 .

**25...Kc7 26.Kf1**

This looks awfully slow.

**26...b4 27.Ne2 Rf8 28.Nf4?!**

White's doctrine contains only a single defect: it doesn't work.

He had to try 28.cxb4 axb4 29.Rxf8 Rxf8+ 30.Kg1 Nc3 31.Nxc3 bxc3 32.Qd1 , although even here Black has excellent chances to pick off the a2-pawn and win.

**28...Rfe8**

Rather than this cautious move, Black had 28...Nxc3! 29.Nxe6+ Bxe6 30.Bxe6 Ne4 31.Qe3 c3! (threat: ...Nd2+ and ...Qxc1) 32.Qe1 Qxa2 and White is busted.

**29.Ne2 Nxc3 30.Nxc3 bxc3 31.Rxc3 Qxa2**

So Black finally got around to chopping a2.

**32.Qe3 a4 33.Ra3 Qb2 34.Ke2 Reb8! 35.Kd1**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Black has at his disposal a disruptive sleight of hand which demolishes White's game. How?

ANSWER: Interference.

**35...Rb3! 36.Rxb3**

Need overlaps contradiction. White was faced with a Hobson's choice, with this forced move.

After 36.cxb3 Qxa3 37.Qd2 axb3 White can resign.

**36...axb3 37.cxb3 Ra3 38.Qc3**

If 38.Rc3 Ra1+ 39.Rc1 c3 (threat: ...c2+ and ...Qxc1) 40.Rxa1 c2+! (zwischenzug) 41.Ke1 Qxa1+ and Black promotes.

**38...Qxg2 39.Be2 Ra2 40.Rc2 Qg1+ 41.Kd2 Qg5+**

The queen gives White's king a look similar to my wife Nancy, when I dare to correct her grammar.

**42.Kd1**

EXERCISE (combination alert): How did Black force resignation?

ANSWER: Attraction.

**42...Ra1+!**

42...Ra1+! 43.Rc1

(43.Qxa1 Qg1+ sees White hang his queen)

43...Rxc1+ 44.Qxc1 Qg1+ 45.Kc2 Qxd4 46.bxc4 Ba4+ 47.Kb1 Qe4+ and White's bishop falls.

SUMMARY: The unbalanced McCutcheon Variation becomes a battle of kingside versus queenside.

**0-1**

### Shirov,A. - Morozevich,A. 19: Frankfurt (rapid), 2000

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7**

In this version Black breaks the pin immediately, at the cost of taking on a potentially bad remaining bishop.

**5.e5 Nfd7 6.Bxe7**

6.h4 is the Alekhine-Chatard gambit, which we look at next game.

**6...Qxe7 7.f4**

White gained kingside and central space, while dumping his bad bishop for Black's good model. Black, in exchange, gets some measure of relief of his cramped situation from the swap, as well as the opportunity to chip away at White's centre from the sides, with ...c5 and eventually ...f6.

NOTE: Should Black be worried about his bad bishop? The answer: my wife Nancy conveniently takes full credit for all our son Tim's good qualities, while blaming me for his annoying habits. Black's bad bishop is similar, in that it appears bad, yet also possesses the potential for good, since it nearly always wiggles into play later on, via g6 or a6 or b5.

**7...a6!**

TIP: Play ...a6 before ...c5, which prevents White's knight from slipping in with Nb5.

7...c5? is unsound: 8.Nb5! O-O forced;

(8...Na6? 9.Nd6+ Kf8 is awful for Black)

9.Nc7 Nxe5 10.Nxa8 cxd4!? (losing)

(but Black is busted anyway after 10...Ng6 11.Qd2 cxd4 12.Nf3 b6 13.O-O-O Bb7 14.h4! Bxa8 15.h5 Nh8 16.Nxd4)

11.fxe5 Qh4+ 12.g3 Qe4+ 13.Qe2 Qxh1 14.Nf3 d3 15.cxd3 Bd7 16.O-O-O Rc8+ 17.Kd2! . Black's queen is trapped after a coming Bg2 or Bh3, C.Lakdawala-A.Morshedi, San Diego (rapid) 2010.

**8.Nf3 c5 9.Qd2 Nc6 10.O-O-O!?**

The anarchic is the sworn enemy of the orderly. Such positions are open to a broad range of stylistic interpretation. White risks castling into the teeth of Black's attack. The rationale behind such a high-risk venture requires Jungian more than chess analysis.

The mercurial Shirov isn't content with a safe and tiny edge after 10.dxc5 Nxc5 11.Bd3 , but of course asking a player with Shirov's confrontational style to accept such a mild course is a bit like requesting King Kong to abide by the court's restraining order to stay 100 yards away from Fay Wray.

**10...c4!**

Normally, such a move helps White if Black relieves central tension, but not here, since White's king is in danger of a pawn storm later on.

**11.f5 Nb6 12.fxe6 fxe6 13.h4 Bd7 14.h5 O-O-O**

What a dirty trick. Morozevich dodges White's intended kingside attack by castling long.

**15.h6 gxh6!**

This move allows Black's bad bishop a potential future with ...Be8 and ...Bg6 later on.

**16.Rxh6 Rdg8 17.Qf4 Be8! 18.Qf6 Bg6 19.g4 Qe8!**

Nyet can do. The French player learns to wait and listen, only striking when the moment is right. Morozevich correctly judges that he will later get attacking chances against White's king, so he keeps queens on the board.

**20.Bg2?**

White fails to sense danger lurking for his king on the margins. We can begin the game with dynamic play, in the belief that we are about to create a Homeric epic, and then blow it all in a single lapse of concentration. White's last move is a blunder of omission.

He should get rid of Black's now powerful (formally) bad bishop with 20.Nh4 , with an approximately even game.

**20...Rf8 21.Qh4 Nb4! 22.Rd2?**

22.Ne1 was forced.

**22...Na4!**

Black's sudden attack is akin to when a branch breaks in the forest, sending a flock of birds fluttering from the tree.

**23.a3 Nxc3 24.bxc3**

EXERCISE (combination alert): How should Black continue his attack?

24.axb4?? is met by the crushing 24...Qa4! .

**24...Qa4!**

ANSWER: Annihilation of defensive barrier.

Black attackers form a perfect isosceles triangle around White's king.

**25.cxb4**

Avoiding 25.axb4?? Qa1# . The queen's sorrow at her brother's mysterious death is an Oscar-worthy performance of her acting skills.

**25...Qxa3+ 26.Kd1**

Once you get the eviction notice from the garden of Eden, there is no key which allows us back into its front gate.

26.Kb1?? c3 forces mate.

**26...Rxf3 27.Qe7**

After 27.Bxf3 Qxf3+ 28.Ke1

(or 28.Re2 Bxc2+! 29.Ke1 Bd3 with a winning attack)

28...Qe3+ 29.Kd1 Rf8 White's king is unable to deal with all of Black's attackers.

**27...Re3!**

Cutting off the white king's access to the e-file and threatening mate on a1.

**28.Qxe6+ Kb8 29.Qd6+ Ka8 30.Re2 Qa1+ 31.Kd2 Qc3+**

31...Qc3+ 32.Kd1 Bxc2+! forces mate.

SUMMARY: Don't fear the bad bishop in the Classical 4...Be7 line, since it inevitably redeems itself from its calamitous fall from grace by emerging into play later in the game.

**0-1**

### Hector,J. - So,W. 20: Malmo, 2011

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7**

In this version Black immediately breaks the pin, at the cost of a potential swap of his good dark-squared bishop.

**5.e5**

White can no longer maintain the central tension.

**5...Nfd7**

Black also has the sidelines: 5...Ne4 6.Bxe7 Qxe7 7.Nxe4 dxe4 8.Qe2 b6 9.O-O-O!

(9.Qxe4 is met with 9...Qb4+ 10.Kd1 Qxb2 11.Rc1 c6 when Black is fine)

9...Bb7 10.g3 Nd7 11.Bg2 f5 12.f3! exf3 13.Bxf3 with both space and activity advantage for White, B.Spassky-J.Sloth, Denmark 1983.

5...Ng8!? (I have experimented with this bizarre sideline) 6.Be3 b6 7.Qg4 g6 with a position weirdly similar to ones we considered at the end of Chapter One.

**6.h4**

The Alekhine-Chatard Gambit (I don't understand why the official name is Alekhine-Chatard Attack, since it's clearly a gambit!).

**6...O-O**

So wisely declines and I think this is Black's best version of the decline.

NOTE: Black can win a pawn with 6...Bxg5 , yet it is by no means free. White gets a lasting initiative/attack after 7.hxg5 Qxg5 8.Nh3 Qe7 9.Nf4 . For the pawn, White obtains a development lead, an open h-file and central space.

**7.Qg4**

Threat: Bh6.

Another line runs 7.Bd3 c5 8.Qh5 g6 9.Qh6 cxd4 10.Nf3 Nxe5 11.Nxe5 dxc3 12.Nxg6 fxg6 13.Bxg6 hxg6 14.Qxg6+ and White should probably accept the perpetual check.

**7...f6!**

TIP: In such situations the French player must rely on the principle: counter a wing attack with central confrontation.

**8.Nf3**

8.Qxe6+!? Kh8 9.exf6 Nxf6 10.Qe2 Bb4 11.O-O-O Bxc3 12.bxc3 Qd6 offers Black plenty of compensation for the pawn, with a development lead and the safer king.

**8...Rf7**

8...fxg5 9.Bd3! gives White a strong attack after 9...Rf5! 10.Nxd5! .

**9.exf6 Nxf6 10.Qg3 Nc6?!**

Now White looks better.

My choice would be 10...c5 chipping away at White's centre.

**11.O-O-O Qf8 12.h5 Bb4 13.Bxf6?!**

White's chances are clearly better after 13.Bd3! Bxc3 14.bxc3 Bd7 15.h6 .

**13...Rxf6 14.Bd3 Bd6 15.Ne5!**

15.Qh4? Rf4 16.Qg3 Re4! wins material, since 17.Qh3 is met with 17...e5 .

**15...Rxf2 16.Rdf1 Bxe5! 17.dxe5!**

Not 17.Qxf2? Qxf2 18.Rxf2 Bxd4 , when Black stands better with two pawns for the exchange, a strong centre and the bishop pair.

**17...Rxf1+ 18.Rxf1 Qe7**

Black is up a pawn, but still behind in development.

**19.Bg6!**

The bishop is the politician who hogs the microphone in the debate. Hector offers a piece to infiltrate, turning the game into one of those Heart of Darkness/Lord of the Flies situations, where civilization is discarded on its descent to barbarism. Yet the all-knowing comp still rates it at dead even here.

**19...hxg6 20.hxg6 Nd4! 21.Rf7 Qd8 22.Qf4?**

WARNING: We can love our attack so much, that we unduly idealize it past its intrinsic worth. Believe it or not, the position was actually even before this mistake, but conditionally on White finding the correct continuation. Now opportunity vanishes beyond the horizon for White.

Correct was 22.Qg4! Nf5 23.Qh5 Nh6 24.g4 Qe8 25.Rxc7 Qd8 26.Nb5 Qf8 27.g5 Qf4+ 28.Kd1 Qf1+ 29.Kd2 Qf2+ and White must take perpetual check, since 30.Kc3?? loses to 30...Qe3+ 31.Kb4 a5+ 32.Ka4 Bd7! with a deadly attack.

**22...Nf5! 23.g4 Nh4 24.Rxg7+**

When we lack the resources, yet take the path anyway, we refute the statement: 'Where there's a will, there's a way'. It was Freud who claimed that all fantasy was the human psyche attempting to correct an "unsatisfying reality". This is a question of raw need. Delivery of checkmate is White's grand narrative, yet the reality fails to back it up.

**24...Kxg7 25.Qf7+ Kh6 26.Qh7+ Kg5 27.Qh5+ Kf4**

Toto, I have a terrible feeling we aren't in Kansas anymore. Scary as the attack looks, White lacks the raw materials to make it count. How distressing when Fate shovels crap our way. It feels like a mate or perpetual check should be there somewhere for White, but the 'somewhere' never materializes.

**28.Ne2+ Ke3 29.g5 Nf3 30.Kd1 Qxg5 31.Qh7**

EXERCISE (combination alert): It is White's king who gets mated, not Black's. How?

ANSWER: Clearance. There is no solution to Black's threat of ...Qd2 mate.

**31...Kf2!**

"I am a man of peace, reluctant to take life. My wife, on the other hand, has no such compunctions," says the king, as he steps aside to allow his wife to do the dirty work.

SUMMARY: I think the Alekhine-Chatard Gambit is best declined by Black.

**0-1**

## 4: The Tarrasch Variation

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2**

The question arises: why would White voluntarily go with a passive piece placement of the knight on d2 when the more aggressive c3-square is available? The answer is that sometimes less is more. White's modest posting of the knight serves a dual function:

1. Black is denied any version of the plan ...Bb4 - which can feel as harassing as a kindergartner tugging the teacher's skirt to get her attention - as in the Winawer or the McCutcheon Variation of the Classical French.

2. By placing the knight on d2, White can back up a big pawn centre with ideas like e5 and f4, and then meet ...c5 with c3. If Black exchanges, then White can recapture with a pawn, maintaining an imposing centre.

**3...--**

In this position Black's responses vary: 3...c5

of which there are two subsets, 3...Nf6

and 3...Nc6 , the Guimard

as well as sidelines like 3...Be7 . Each line is quite distinctive from the other, but all have one thing in common: the Tarrasch lines tend to be the safest ones for White versus the French.

Privacy is a quaintly antiquated concept in the chess world. If a sharp new move is played at Wijk aan Zee by some top GM, which alters theory, everyone at the club level can play the same move on his or her opponent the following day. The Tarrasch (with a few exception lines) tends to be immune from such sharp shifts in theory, since the positions reached tend to be less confrontational than ones from Winawer or Classical lines, so we don't require a current of theoretical information to constantly keep us afloat.

### Karpov,A. - Korchnoi,V. 21: 12th matchgame, Moscow, 1974

TIP: If you dream of understanding the secrets of the isolani line of the Tarrasch, then the place to start your study is the Karpov-Korchnoi Candidates' final match of 1974, where the virtuosos clashed, like clapping hands, in this line again and again.

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2**

The Tarrasch Variation.

NOTE: White voluntarily place his knight on a passive square, rather than play to c3, as in the previous chapters.

Indeed, d2 is a passive square, but also embedded within are the following benefits for White:

1. White is granted the option of meeting ...c5 with c3. This means that White, in many lines of the Tarrasch, may retain an ominously large pawn centre, by recapturing d4 with a pawn, rather than a piece.

2. By playing the knight to d2, this means that Black is denied ...Bb4 pins, as seen in the Winawer and McCutcheon variations.

**3...c5**

Black's most principled response, immediately challenging White for the inferior knight's development on d2.

Later in the chapter we look at 3...Nf6

and 3...Nc6 .

Instead: The odd hybrid 3...Be7 is favoured by GM Morozevich: 4.Ngf3

(4.e5 is met by 4...c5 5.Qg4 Kf8 6.dxc5 Nc6 7.Ngf3 h5 8.Qg3 ; both ...Nb4 and ...Nh6/...Nf5 are in the air and Black's chances feel adequate)

4...Nf6 5.e5 Nfd7 6.Bd3 c5 7.c3 Nc6 8.O-O g5!? . This move undermines d4, at the cost of weakening Black's kingside.

3...dxe4 is the Rubinstein, which we examine in the final chapter of the book.

3...a6 is another entry way into the isolani positions after 4.Ngf3 c5 5.exd5 exd5 .

**4.exd5**

4.Ngf3 Nc6 5.Bb5

(5.exd5 transposes to our game after 5...exd5)

5...cxd4 6.Nxd4 Bd7 7.Nxc6 Bxc6 8.Bxc6+ bxc6 9.c4 Nf6 is known to give Black a dynamically even game.

**4...exd5**

Taking on the (future) isolani is the door to Black's freedom in this line. In exchange for his structural weakness, Korchnoi gets immediate breathing space for his pieces - a rarity on the Black side of a French.

Next game we look at 4...Qxd5 .

**5.Ngf3 Nc6 6.Bb5 Bd6 7.O-O cxd4**

It's official now. Black accepts an isolani.

Also played is 7...Nge7 8.dxc5 Bxc5 9.Nb3 and now I suggest that you avoid 9...Bb6 .

WARNING: From my experience, Black should avoid playing ...Bb6.

I think Black is better off posting the bishop on d6, since White soon challenges the b6 post after 10.Re1 O-O 11.Be3 and Black either makes an unwanted swap on e3, or loses time sliding the bishop to c7.

**8.Nb3 Nge7 9.Nbxd4**

NOTE: In some cases Black's lone isolani is welded back together if White chops on c6, reaching a hanging pawns position, so be prepared for this shift, which can happen at any time in the middlegame.

**9...O-O 10.c3 Bg4 11.Qa4**

More aggressive than the meek 11.Be2 .

**11...Bh5!?**

Korchnoi offers a pawn, which Karpov dare not accept.

11...Qd7 is the safer course.

**12.Be3**

After 12.Nxc6?! bxc6 13.Bxc6? Nxc6 14.Qxc6 Rc8 15.Qa6

(WARNING: Here 15.Qxd5?? would fall for a beginner's discovered attack trap: 15...Bxh2+ and White loses a queen)

15...Bxf3 16.gxf3 Qd7 17.Rd1 Rc4! (the rook attempts to swing into the kingside to attack White's king) 18.Rd4 Rxd4 19.cxd4 Re8 20.Be3 Re6! threatens ...Bxh2+ and ...Rxa6. Black has a strong attack.

**12...Qc7**

Covering c6 and taking aim at h2.

**13.h3 Na5**

Worrying White about a coming ...Nc4.

13...a6 is the calmer and safer choice.

**14.Bd3**

Strategic threat: Nb5.

**14...Nc4!?**

...which Korchnoi ignores! He is sick and tired of waiting around for the apocalypse to happen, so he decides to jump start it himself. This disturbance of the delicate equilibrium is an open display of contempt for White's coming pin along the d-file. It takes a mind-boggling degree of self-confidence to enter such peril willingly. Why is it that sometimes at the board we are haunted by mad thoughts, yet outside the realm of chess, we are far from insane?

The sensible yet boring 14...a6 avoids the complications which arise in the game's continuation.

**15.Nb5 Qd7!**

Once we launch a complex idea, it has a way of becoming detached from us, as a new-born infant from its mother after the umbilical cord is cut. This turns into a hair-pulling cat fight between the two queens. Korchnoi's last move allows the following factors to arise:

1. He pins the b5-knight.

2. He cunningly takes aim at h3, which becomes deeply significant as the game goes on.

3. He places his queen perilously on the d-file, which appears to allow a winning pin, which just isn't the case when we examine the position to a deeper degree.

**16.Bxc4 dxc4 17.Rfd1**

It may appear that this is the realization of Korchnoi's most terrible nightmare. In positions of such high complexity levels, our understanding can't be fragmentary, without a glimpse of the whole. On the surface it appears as if White's position is infused with fearful portent and that Black's chances range from anorexic to dead. After all, the d6-bishop is pinned, with no apparent way out. But Korchnoi, one of the greatest pure calculators of all time, worked everything out with perfect, comp-like accuracy.

Karpov correctly avoided 17.Qxc4?! Rac8 18.Qb3 Bxf3 19.Nxd6 Rc6! and White's king soon comes under fire.

**17...Nf5!**

Each keeps the other in sight, circling warily. What a joy when our critical idea pokes its head up from the complications. Korchnoi rises to the challenge of meeting his position's heavy calculation demands. His move - the snare which steals White's initiative - is inseparable from the larger context of delivery of checkmate or perpetual check on White's king.

**18.Qxc4!**

Karpov correctly avoids the tempting 18.g4? . The exclusion of a single detail can either make it worse or improve. My proof? Imagine if The Sound of Music had focused on the harried Von Trapp family's plight to outrun the Nazis, without the characters annoyingly belting out a song every three minutes (I blame you most, Julie Andrews!). Then it would have been an excellent movie, rather than painful one in its current state, which my wife forces me to watch from time to time (and sing along to!). After 18...Bxg4 19.hxg4 Nxe3 20.Ne5

(20.fxe3?? Qxg4+ 21.Kf2 Qg3+ forces mate)

20...Qe7 21.Nxd6 Nxd1 22.Rxd1 Qxe5 White has no compensation for losing the exchange.

**18...Bxf3**

At last, Black's attackers are granted an audience with White's king.

**19.gxf3 Nxe3 20.fxe3**

20.Rxd6?? loses material to the kamikaze 20...Qxd6! 21.Nxd6 Nxc4 22.Nxc4 and Black wins.

**20...Qxh3**

White's worries spill over to this king. This move allows the Black's queen to escape the suffocating pin on the d-file and deliver perpetual check.

**21.Nxd6 Qg3+ 22.Kf1 Qxf3+ 23.Ke1 Qg3+!**

The queen punishes her younger brother with a 'time out', which admittedly is a little awkward now that he is an adult. White's king can never cross over the d-file, since his knight would hang.

SUMMARY: If we as Black desire activity, we must be willing to get our hands a bit dirty with the structural concession of taking on an isolani.

**1/2-1/2**

### Peters,J. - Lakdawala,C. 22: Southern California State Ch, LA, 2001

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2**

I always view it as strange when a natural tactician like Jack plays the Tarrasch, perhaps the most strategic of all the lines to meet French. It reminds me of the gruff Marine drill sergeant, who happens to be a closet ballet and opera lover.

**3...c5 4.exd5 Qxd5**

NOTE: In this version Black goes for a kind of Scandinavian, but one where White lacks the normal Nc3 tempo gain.

**5.Ngf3 cxd4**

This isn't a real extra pawn, since Black isn't safely able to hold on to it for long.

**6.Bc4**

White may be denied the Nc3 tempo gain, but he can improvise with a bishop tempo on Black's queen.

**6...Qd8**

6...Qd6 is also played: 7.Qe2

(7.O-O will probably transpose to the game continuation)

7...Nf6 8.Nb3 Nc6 9.Bg5 Be7 10.O-O-O with a sharp opposite wings castling position.

**7.O-O Nc6 8.Nb3 Nf6**

WARNING: Don't try and hang on to your 'extra' pawn. For example, 8...e5?? is completely out of whack with Black's needs. After 9.Re1 f6 10.Nfxd4 White regained the lost pawn with a massive development lead.

**9.Nbxd4 Nxd4 10.Nxd4 a6 11.Re1 Qc7 12.Qe2**

The most critical line for both sides runs 12.Bb3 Bd6 13.Nf5! Bxh2+ 14.Kh1 O-O 15.Nxg7! Rd8! . This line has its idiosyncratic rules and conventions. It's easy to lose our way in the theoretical labyrinthine alleyways of this variations, so study this one well if you enter this line as Black.

(15...Kxg7? loses to 16.Qd4! . Now if 16...Bd6 17.Bh6+! Kg6 18.Re3 Rg8 19.Rh3 Qc5 20.Rg3+! White wins)

16.Qf3 Kxg7 17.Bh6+ Kg6 18.c3 (threat: Bc2+) 18...Nh5 was R.Bruno-C.Lakdawa, San Diego (rapid) 2007. Believe it or not, this is the starting position of theory in this line!

**12...Bd6 13.Nf3**

Black equalizes easily after this passive retreat.

More dynamic is 13.Bg5! O-O!

(13...Bxh2+?! 14.Kh1 Bd6 15.Nf5 gives White a scary looking development lead and attack)

14.Bd3 Bxh2+

(14...Nd5 is also possible)

15.Kf1 Bf4 16.Bxf6 gxf6 17.g3 Rd8 18.Qe4 f5 19.Nxf5 exf5 20.Qxf4 Qxf4 21.gxf4 Be6 . Maybe White has a microbe of an edge in the coming ending, since Black's doubled pawns are easier to attack than White's.

**13...b5**

Preparing to fianchetto, taking aim at White's king.

**14.Bd3 Bb7 15.Ne5 O-O 16.Bf4 Nd5 17.Bg3 Nb4! 18.Rad1**

White was probably better off with 18.Be4 .

**18...Rad8 19.c3 Nxd3**

Black picked up the bishop pair and stands a shade better.

**20.Rxd3 f6?**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Black's last move was premature. How can White exploit this lapse?

**21.Ng4?**

ANSWER: Both sides missed 21.Nd7! (clearance/double attack) 21...Qxd7

(21...Bxg3 22.Qxe6+ Rf7 23.hxg3 Bc8 is met with 24.Qe8+! Rf8 25.Nxf8 Rxe8 26.Rxe8 Kf7 27.Red8 with a clear advantage for White)

22.Rxd6 Qf7 23.Rxe6 when Black is down a pawn and struggling.

**21...e5**

Now Black stands clearly better, with the bishop pair, central dominance and the superior queenside majority, versus White's lethargic queenside version.

**22.Red1 Be7 23.f3 Rxd3 24.Rxd3 Rd8 25.Ne3 Rxd3 26.Qxd3 Qd6**

White must either swap down into a pure two bishops versus bishop and knight ending, or cede the d-file.

**27.Qxd6 Bxd6 28.Bf2 Kf7 29.Nf5 Bf8 30.Bb6 Ke6**

A new advantage emerges for Black, in the form of a fine king position.

**31.Ne3 f5**

I begin to roll forward my majority.

**32.Kf2 Bd6 33.Nf1 e4 34.Nd2 Bxh2 35.fxe4 Be5?!**

35...Bd6 is more accurate

but 35...fxe4? is also a mistake since White can play 36.g3! threatening Nf1, and if 36...h5 37.Nf1 Bxg3+ 38.Nxg3 when White has all the winning chances.

**36.exf5+?!**

36.Nf3! is a better try.

**36...Kxf5 37.Nb3 Bd5 38.Nc5 Bxa2 39.Nxa6**

Each pawn swap brings White closer to his goal of a draw.

**39...Bd5 40.Nb4 Be4 41.Be3 h5 42.Na6 h4 43.Nc5 Bd5 44.Kg1 g5 45.Bf2 Bf6**

In this way Black can play ...g4 without hanging h4.

**46.Nd7 Bg7 47.Kh2 Bc6 48.Nb6 Be5+ 49.Kg1 Ke4**

Black's powerful king almost represents an extra piece, and White is busted.

**50.c4!?**

With each concession we give away something which we are unlikely to get back. This desperate move only weakens White's b-pawn. The problem is if White does nothing, then Black's king simply walks over and attacks White's queenside pawns.

**50...b4**

TIP: The side attempting to win the ending should retain as many pawns as possible on the board.

**51.b3 Kd3 52.Nd5 Bxd5 53.cxd5 Bd6 54.Bb6 g4 55.Bd8**

EXERCISE (critical decision): This position must be obeyed exactly, like when our prescription drug bottle label commands us: 'One tablet, to be taken with meals, three times a day.' My opponent continues in a guise of genial cooperation, when in reality he plots a final desperate trap. Black can play 55...h3, followed by ...Kc3, or he can play the immediate 55...Kc3. Be warned though: a trap is treacherously embedded within one of the variations, which allows White to escape with a draw. Which line would you play?

**55...h3??**

One recalls the waning: 'For fools rush in where angels fear to tread.' This blunder allows my devious buddy IM Jack Peters to rig the position to his defensive needs. Before you accuse me of professional incompetence, let me explain: the game was played in the final round of the first weekend of the State Championship and that fifth cup of coffee I downed didn't have much effect eradicating the fatigue factor, coupled with that dreaded 'Any-move-will-win' overconfidence.

ANSWER: Black wins (barely!) with 55...Kc3! (the b3-pawn is laid out like ritual human sacrifice for the high priest) 56.Bxh4 Kxb3 57.Kf2 Kc4 58.Ke3 Be5 59.Kd2 b3 60.Kc1 Kxd5 61.Kb1 Ke4 62.Be1 Ke3 63.Bh4 Ke2 64.Kc1 Kf1 65.g3 Kg2 66.Kb1 Bxg3 67.Bf6 Bf4 68.Kb2 Kh3 69.Bd4 g3 70.Kxb3 g2 71.Kc2 Kh2 72.Kd1 Kh1 73.Ke2 Bh2 74.Kf3 Bg1! 75.Bf6 Bc5 and Black promotes.

**56.gxh3 gxh3 57.Ba5!**

Aaargh! Oh filthy cheapo, where is thy sting? I had to fight the urge to immediately drive to Home Depot to purchase rope for a noose! I completely forgot about this drawing idea. I find it an astonishingly tactless affront when one of my impudent opponents has the nerve to swindle me out of my otherwise honest win.

Black ends up with bishop and wrong-coloured rook pawn, which is drawn after 57.Ba5! Kc3 58.Bxb4+! Kxb4 (Black's stock doubles in value, but only the day after he sells all of it!) 59.Kh1 Kxb3 60.Kg1 Kc4 61.Kh1 Kxd5 .

WARNING: If you are Black, this position is like biting into a ripe pear, only to discover the rot in the middle. The bishop must be of the same colour of the h-pawn's queening square, or else the game is drawn, as is the case here. 62.Kg1 Ke4 63.Kh1 Kf3 64.Kg1 Bf4 65.Kh1 and the trouble is Black is unable to make progress, since he can never eject White's king from the corner. If 65...Kf2 then White is stalemated.

SUMMARY: 4...Qxd5 is a solid line, with similarities to the Scandinavian Defence, which is 1 e4 d5 2 exd5 Qxd5. In the French version, White is denied Nc3, since the knight has been committed to d2.

**1/2-1/2**

### Navara,D. - Harshkou,M. 23: European Rapid Championship, Minsk, 2015

**1.d4 e6 2.e4 d5 3.Nd2 Nf6**

Two groups can look at the same position and interpret it with completely different eyes, the way one person reads Moby Dick as a tale of obsession and revenge, while another sees it as a Bernie Sanders-like critique of the terrible living conditions of the 19th Century American whaling industry. This move, which induces central resolution, is a constant source of argument between my San Diego IM buddies, John Watson and Keaton Kiewra. John thinks Black's resources are fully adequate in the 3...Nf6 line, while Keaton and I feel like White generates a nagging edge, due to Black's coming backward e6-pawn, and White's space.

**4.e5**

Recently White experimented with 4.Bd3 , the idea of which is to retain central pawn tension for as long as possible. Following 4...c5 5.c3 Nc6 6.Ngf3 cxd4 7.cxd4 dxe4 8.Nxe4 White takes on an isolani in the hopes of initiative and attacking chances.

**4...Nfd7 5.c3 c5 6.Bd3 Nc6 7.Ne2**

NOTE: We develop the knight on e2, reserving f3 for the other knight.

If White plays an immediate 7.Ngf3 then he should be ready to gambit a pawn after 7...Qb6 8.O-O cxd4 9.cxd4 Nxd4 which is a position we examine next game.

**7...cxd4 8.cxd4 Qb6**

Alternatives: 8...Nb6 (this set-up is called the Leningrad system) 9.O-O Bd7 10.b3 Nb4 11.Bb1 a5 (Black needs to provoke White into weakening pawn moves on the queenside) 12.a3 Nc6 13.Bd3 a4 14.b4 Na7 15.Nc3 g6 16.Bb2 Bg7 17.Rc1 O-O 18.Qe2 Rc8 and White's kingside space is probably worth more than Black's attempt to usurp the queenside light squares, B.Baker-C.Lakdawala, San Diego (rapid) 2009.

8...f6 9.Nf4 Nxd4 10.Qh5+ Ke7 11.exf6+ Nxf6 12.Ng6+ hxg6 13.Qxh8 Kf7 when White's edge in material may be slightly worth more than Black's central control.

**9.Nf3 f6**

Black logically chips away at both e5 and d5.

**10.exf6 Nxf6**

Black takes on a backward e6-pawn, while getting an open f-file for his rooks.

**11.O-O Bd6 12.Nc3 O-O**

WARNING: 12...Nxd4?? is an elementary error after 13.Nxd4 Qxd4?? (otherwise Black just remains down a piece) 14.Bb5+ and Black's queen falls.

**13.a3 Bd7 14.Be3 Rae8!?**

WARNING: White's b2-pawn is safe from the black queen's felonious clutches. It isn't free!

Black's queen is trapped after 14...Qxb2?? 15.Na4 .

However, 14...Be8! prevents White's coming idea. Then 15.Ng5 Nd8 16.Qc2 h6 looks okay for Black, who stands only a microbe worse.

**15.Ne5!**

A promising pawn sacrifice.

**15...Bxe5**

It's a huge concession for Black to hand over his dark-squared bishop, but 15...Re7?! 16.b4 Be8 17.Rc1 a6 18.Na4 looks clearly better for White, who begins to dominate the dark squares.

**16.dxe5 d4??**

A variation-specific line can't be interpreted solely through a process of abstraction, with vague, general ideas. This is the start of an inherently unsound plan, which is orphaned at birth, and which takes the leap from reality to illusion. When there is scant evidence to support our claim, this doesn't always mean that we will refrain from our original intent. It's a mistake to push ahead boldly in a position which imposes stringent limits. This move loses instantly. If we can't attain our desires, then the next best thing is the edited version.

Black had to try 16...Qxb2 17.exf6 Qxc3 18.Rb1 b6 19.fxg7 Qxg7 20.Qd2 Rf6 21.Bg5 , although White has more than enough compensation for his pawn, with the bishop pair, dark-square control and a slightly aired out black king.

**17.exf6 dxe3**

EXERCISE (combination alert): This exercise doesn't require the talents of Sherlock Holmes, or even Nancy Drew. How did White force the win?

ANSWER: Discovered attack/double attack.

**18.Bxh7+!**

The bishop just can't wait to die and go to heaven. Now Black's position devolves into incoherence.

**18...Kxh7 19.Qxd7**

A direct mate threat can't be constrained by a variety of interpretations. Black is curiously helpless. White threatens mate on g7, and the only way to avert it is to give up a full rook.

**19...exf2+ 20.Kh1 Kh6**

The black king's defenders are forced to lay still as wax figures. This move avoids the loss of the rook, at the cost of his king. When you have two paths to choose from, and they both lose, it's similar to the condemned prisoner given the choice of a firing squad or hanging - it doesn't really matter, since the end result is the same.

20...Rg8 21.f7 skewers Black's rooks. The dreaded geometric anomaly is the joker in the deck.

**21.Qxg7+**

The queen hacks away at Black's king, like an absentminded butcher, at a side of beef.

**21...Kh5 22.f7 Rd8 23.Ne4**

23.Ne4 threatens mate on g5, and if 23...Qb5 24.Nf6+ Kh4 25.Qg4# . The king and queen come to an amicable and fair settlement: 100% for her, and 0% for him.

SUMMARY: If you enter the 3...Nf6 line, then be prepared to take on a backward e6-pawn, banking on counterplay with your rooks down the open f-file.

**1-0**

### Navara,D. - Vaganian,R. 24: Mainz (rapid), 2009

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2 c5**

A more common move order runs 3...Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.Bd3 c5 6.c3 Nc6 7.Ngf3 . Multiple assumptions are embedded in this move:

1. White's last move involves the future sacrifice of his or her d4-pawn.

2. White hopes that by doing so, the development lead leads to a powerful initiative/attack.

**4.Ngf3 Nf6 5.e5**

5.exd5 Qxd5 6.Bc4 Qd8 7.O-O cxd4 reaches a line we already examined earlier in the chapter.

**5...Nfd7 6.c3 Nc6 7.Bd3 Qb6**

NOTE: It may appear that White mishandled the opening and Black's pressure on d4 forces White to play dxc5, leaving Black in control over the centre. In reality White has no intention of playing dxc5. Instead he castles, offering to sacrifice d4 for a development lead.

**8.O-O!**

White hasn't shifted into anything-goes mode. Faith in his coming initiative/attack has already been invested and it's too late to turn back. White's move is made with the thought: it's not a good idea to launch an attack, adopting the stance of provisionality. So White takes a chance and gambits his d-pawn.

**8...cxd4**

If the thought of long defence for a pawn doesn't appeal to you, then consider declining with a line like 8...g6 9.dxc5! Qc7

(9...Nxc5 10.Nb3 Nxd3 11.Qxd3 Bg7 12.Re1 also offers White an edge, due to the extra space, kingside attacking chances, and control over d4)

10.Nb3 Ndxe5 11.Nxe5 Nxe5 12.Bf4 Bg7 13.Re1 . Black's central pawns are negated by White's development lead and nagging pin of the e5-knight. I slightly prefer White here.

**9.cxd4 Nxd4 10.Nxd4 Qxd4**

When an evil genie grants our wish, it often manifests as the opposite of how we originally envisioned it.

WARNING: This is no 'free' pawn for Black, who must undergo defensive pain for it.

This position has similarities with Milner-Barry Gambit, which we look at next chapter. Black's extra d-pawn is the horse Black puts money on, praying he doesn't finish 13 lengths behind the winner, due to White's imposing development lead.

**11.Nf3 Qb6**

For the sacrificed pawn, White gets:

1. A dangerous development lead.

2. Black's run-down development, in serious disrepair, automatically means White may generate an attack on Black's king.

3. White controls d4, and may later plant a piece on the square.

**12.Qc2**

Taking aim at h7.

12.Qa4 is played more often. The idea is to swing the queen over to g4 to generate a kingside attack: 12...Qb4 (this move blocks White's intent) 13.Qc2 Nc5 14.Bd2 Qa4 15.b3 Qd7 16.Be2 and White's development lead compensates for Black's extra pawn.

**12...h6**

This way Black removes worries like Bxh7 and Bg5.

**13.Bd2**

Connecting his rooks.

**13...Nc5 14.Be3 Qb4?**

When we introduce a new idea, our concept is in direct conflict with the powerful force of precedence. This is clearly no improvement and may be the starting point of Black's troubles, where his queen loses yet more time. Black's development lag is still a treatable ailment, yet with his last move it lays dying of medical neglect.

He should play 14...Bd7! 15.Rac1 Rc8 16.Qd2 (threat: b4) 16...Qd8 17.Bb1 Be7 . We reach a position where defence and offence remain in uneasy balance. White still retains attacking chances, compensated by Black's extra pawn.

**15.Be2**

White seeks to retain as many attackers as possible on the board, so he avoids ...Nxd3.

**15...Bd7 16.Rfc1**

NOTE: As unnatural as it looks, this is the correct rook to play to c1. The reason is that for now, the fight is on the queenside. The other one may later back up the b-pawn, after future a3 and b4 pawn pushes.

**16...Rc8 17.Nd4 Qa5 18.a3**

Threatening b4.

**18...Qd8**

18...Qa4?? 19.b3 costs Black a piece.

**19.Bb5!**

This move undermines Black's support of the c8-rook. White threatens Bxd7+, followed by b4, which fatally displaces Black's king.

**19...Ra8!**

The only move.

After 19...a6?? 20.Bxd7+ Kxd7 21.b4 Ne4 22.Qa4+ Ke7 23.Rxc8 Qxc8 24.Rc1 Qb8

(24...Qd7 25.Qa5 threatening Rc7, is deadly)

25.b5! Black's king won't survive for long in the middle.

**20.b4 Na6?**

EXERCISE (combination alert): We sense that something is terribly amiss in Black's position. His last move allowed White a devastating shot. Hidden combinations present us with a series of blanks we must correctly fill in. Do you see White's coming idea?

Black had to return the pawn and pray for survival after 20...Bxb5! 21.Nxb5 Qd7 22.Nxa7 Rxa7 23.Bxc5 Ra8 24.Bxf8 Rxf8 . White owns the only open file and retains excellent chances to win.

**21.Nxe6!**

ANSWER: Annihilation of defensive barrier. White's queen is granted entry to g6, after which Black's king is hunted.

The g6-square is the bomb with the lit fuse.

**21...fxe6**

When we inadvertently walk into our opponent's sudden shot, we become the wounded wild animal, clipped by the hunter's bullet.

**22.Bxa6?!**

Mistimed.

22.Qg6+! is a more accurate move order: 22...Ke7 23.Bxa6 b6 24.Rc3 transposes to the game continuation.

**22...b6?!**

Covering the c5-square against a potentially fatal bishop check there. Yet Black had better.

How best defensive hope lies in the line 22...Qb8! 23.Be2 Qxe5 24.g3! Be7 25.Bf4 Qf6 26.Bh5+ Kf8 27.Qc7 Be8 28.Qxb7 Rd8 . Even here though, it is highly unlikely Black survives.

**23.Qg6+ Ke7**

Now Black's king enters the fiery pit of his own damnation.

**24.Rc3!**

Dual purpose:

1. White prepares to double rooks on the c-file, infiltrating c7.

2. White's rook may swing over to the kingside in pursuit of Black's king.

**24...Qe8 25.Qg4 Kf7 26.Bd3**

Taking aim at g6.

**26...Kg8**

The chilling implication of Black's last move: how will he ever bring into play his h8-rook? Without use of this rook, Black's game is depleted by internecine strife, as if one nation at war with itself.

**27.Bg6 Qd8 28.Rac1 a5**

Black's position, the tattered fringe of a poor woman's dress, nears zugzwang.

28...Rc8?? 29.Qf4! threatening mate on f7 is fatal for Black: 29...Rh7 30.Qf7+ Kh8 31.Qxd7! Qxd7 32.Rxc8 Kg8 33.R1c7 Qxc7 34.Rxc7 . Black plays the ending without an army and can resign.

**29.b5**

Black's bishop is unable to touch b5, since its services are required in protection of e6.

**29...Bc5**

Complete desperation.

**30.Bxc5 bxc5 31.Rxc5 Qe7 32.b6**

The b-pawn's push is fatal for Black, who is essentially down a rook.

**32...Rb8**

EXERCISE (combination alert): White's b-pawn is under attack, or is it? How does White force mate?

ANSWER: Weak back rank. The b-pawn is untouchable, and White now threatens Rc8+.

**33.b7!**

White hungers for closure.

**33...Qf8**

33...Rxb7 allows White to force mate with 34.Rc8+ .

**34.Rc7**

34.Rc7 Qd8 35.Qf3 (threatening mate on f7) 35...Be8 36.Bf7+! Kh7 37.Qd3+ g6 38.Qxg6# is mate.

SUMMARY: When White develops the g1-knight to f3, he essentially offers to gambit a pawn, for which full compensation is attained.

**1-0**

### Portisch,L. - Tal,M. 25: European Team Ch, Oberhausen, 1961

**1.d4 e6 2.e4 d5 3.Nd2 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4**

NOTE: With this move White makes his intent clear: he intends to erect a gigantic pawn centre and hold it, at the cost of time.

**5...c5 6.c3 Nc6 7.Ndf3**

This unnatural looking move is White's main line: d4 is given adequate protection, since now the g1-knight develops to e2. The cost of protecting White's gigantic centre is his piece tangle and looming development lag. Black's goal is to create early confrontation, when White isn't ready for it.

Black gets decent counterplay if White goes for the more natural 7.Ngf3 Qb6 8.Nb3 a5! (intending to undermine with ...a4 next) 9.a4 cxd4 10.cxd4 Bb4+ 11.Kf2 f6 12.Be3 O-O with a good position for Black, who is seriously ahead in development, and threatens tricks on e5.

**7...Qb6**

7...cxd4 8.cxd4 Nb6 is the Leningrad Variation. Black doesn't worry about White's centre and hopes to achieve gains on the queenside via the light squares: 9.Bd3 Bd7 10.Ne2 h5 11.O-O g6 12.a3 a5 13.b3 a4 14.b4 Na7 15.Nc3 . In my opinion, this position is a tough sell for Black, since there is imminent danger of getting squeezed on both wings.

**8.g3**

White's light-squared bishop will be developed on h3, where it hinders Black's ...f6 ideas.

**8...cxd4 9.cxd4 f6**

Also seen is 9...Bb4+ 10.Kf2 g5!? 11.fxg5 Ndxe5 .

TIP: Be on the lookout for tactics and sacrifices on e5, which are a recurring theme in this variation.

After 12.Nxe5 Nxe5 13.Kg2 Nc6 14.Nf3 White continues to lag in development, while Black may later experience vulnerability along the open f-file and kingside dark squares.

**10.Bh3**

Worrying Black about the e6-square.

**10...fxe5 11.fxe5 Bb4+**

Forcing White's king to move on to the newly opened f-file, since a bishop block hangs d4.

**12.Kf1**

The careless 12.Kf2?? walks into Black's standard pin tactic 12...Ndxe5! , winning an important pawn.

**12...Nf8**

I would avoid this contortion.

12...O-O is more natural when White should just slide his king to g2 and avoid the greedy 13.Bxe6+?! Kh8 14.Kg2 Ndxe5! (that e5 tactic again!) 15.Bxc8 Nxf3 16.Nxf3 Raxc8 17.Rf1 Be7 . Now ...Bf6 is coming when White's d4-pawn is under pressure, and he remains behind in development.

**13.Ne2 Ng6 14.Kg2 O-O 15.Bg4!**

A strong positional move, shoring up support of f3, while preparing to gain yet more territory with h4 and h5.

**15...Bd7 16.h4 Ba5!**

The idea is to move the queen and then transfer the bishop to b6.

**17.Rb1**

Threat: b4, winning a piece.

**17...Qb5 18.h5 Nge7 19.h6**

Creating a puncture on the kingside dark squares in Black's camp.

**19...g6 20.Bg5 Nf5 21.Bxf5! Rxf5 22.g4! Rxf3!?**

NOTE: Exchange sacrifices on f3 are thematic in this line, but Black also needs something else for it, like White's d4-pawn - which Tal didn't get in this instance.

Some philosophers claim that virtue can only be nurtured when it is isolated from contaminating temptations. Technically this move is unsound. Feeling squeezed, Tal husbands his forces into a desperate lunge at White's semi-exposed king. I suppose our vows of temperance and moderation turn into dim memories when we feel temptation's caress. Such a dubious sacrifice is too great a temptation for a reprobate benefactor of material like Tal.

Now you may be asking: Tal's sacrifice looks like a guilt offering from a bad position, and a guaranteed pathway to penury. Then why not give the move a question mark, rather than a euphemistic 'interesting' mark? My answer: because the guy playing Black is Mikhail Tal, who made a career of confusing opponents with unsound but dangerous sacrifices!

In my book 'Tal: Move by Move', I don't recall a single game where Tal - a master of transitioning from the orderly to the cluttered - didn't sacrifice, sound, or otherwise! In it, there are multiple examples of him swindling world champions, where again and again, he escaped justice from surreally improbable odds. Tal had no interest in getting slowly squeezed by playing it safe with a line like 22...Rf7 23.b4 Bd8 24.a4 Qc4 25.Bxd8 Nxd8 . Black's game feels the painful tug of territorial regression.

**23.Kxf3 Bb6**

Another route could be 23...Nxe5+!? 24.dxe5 d4 25.Kg3 Rf8 26.Bf4 g5! 27.Rh5! gxf4+ 28.Nxf4 , although Black doesn't have enough compensation for the exchange.

**24.Kg3 Rf8 25.Qd2 Bc7!? 26.Bf4**

White has cause to be simultaneously reassured and unsettled, much like watching a scary movie, which we realize is unable to physically harm us (unless it induces a heart attack!).

**26...Be8**

Maybe Tal dreams of ...g5, followed by ...Bg6, activating his light-squared bishop.

**27.Rhf1 Bb6 28.Rf2 Nb4**

Seeking entry into the weakened white light squares, via d3.

**29.Rbf1 Nd3 30.Rf3 Qxb2 31.Qxd3! Bb5**

EXERCISE (combination alert): We sometimes eagerly attempt to exploit weakness in the opponent's camp, while simultaneously failing to recognize his or her strengths. It appears as if White is in danger. After all, his queen and knight are both loose.

Portisch had seen deeper into the position and exploited a weakness in Black's camp. How did White completely rebuff Black's intention?

ANSWER: Weak back rank/queen sacrifice.

**32.Bg5!**

Threat: Rxf8 mate.

ANSWER no 2: Even stronger was 32.Bc1! which is an immediate game-ender.

**32...Rf5**

Suddenly, the presumed dispenser of pain, is now the unfortunate recipient of it. This is a desperate attempt to block the f-file.

Black just doesn't have time for 32...Rxf3+ 33.Qxf3 Qxe2 34.Qf8# .

**33.Qc3! Bxd4 34.Qc8+ Kf7**

The king wearily faces his interrogator.

**35.Qc7+**

Black is mated.

SUMMARY: When White goes for the f4 bind line, Black must find a way to disrupt and confront early, or risk suffering a squeeze, like the one seen in this game.

**1-0**

### Baker,B. - Lakdawala,C. 26: San Diego (rapid), 2007

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2 Nc6**

The Guimard Variation is a speciality product, which we are unlikely to find stocked on the shelves of Walmart.

NOTE: Black's last move makes difficult the natural ...c5 counterplay. In the Guimard Black's main source of play is to go for the ...f6 break, as seen here and the next game.

**4.Ngf3**

Covering d4, while developing.

**4...Nf6 5.e5 Nd7 6.c3**

At a club level, I find this is the most commonly played move.

Next game we look at White's alternatives 6.Be2

6.Nb3

and 6.Bb5

Instead, 6.Bd3 f6 7.Ng5! (threat: Qh5+) 7...Ndxe5! (this counter sacrifice clears d7 for Black's king) 8.dxe5 fxg5 9.Qh5+ g6! (this makes White waste time with his bishop) 10.Bxg6+ Kd7 leads to a chaotic position, K.Kiewra-C.Lakdawala, Internet (blitz) 2016. Note that 11.Nf3?? is unplayable, since Black can play 11...hxg6! , and if 12.Qxh8?? Bb4+ wins White's queen.

**6...f6**

Black targets e5, when White has trouble defending it.

**7.exf6?!**

TIP: Hang on to your pawn centre if you can.

White's centre soon begins to evaporate after this concession.

He should fight for control over e5 with 7.Bb5! fxe5!? 8.dxe5 g6?! (8...Be7 is correct) 9.Nd4?!

(9.Nb3 gives White an advantage)

9...Nxd4

(9...Ndxe5 looks rather scary for Black, who lags in development)

10.cxd4 c5 11.dxc5 Bxc5 12.O-O O-O 13.Nf3 Be7 and White stood slightly better, D.Hart-C.Lakdawala, San Diego (rapid) 2002.

**7...Qxf6 8.Bb5**

After 8.Bd3 Bd6 9.O-O O-O 10.Nb3 e5 Black already stands slightly better.

**8...Bd6 9.O-O O-O 10.Nb3**

This move is designed to prevent ...e5 because then d5 hangs.

**10...e5!**

TIP: The goal in the Guimard is to play ...f6 and then later break with ...e5.

When we fight for the initiative, we shouldn't do it half in and half out.

This pawn sacrifice is an improvement over the last time my opponent and I met in this position, where I tried 10...a6 11.Bxc6 bxc6 12.Bg5 Qg6 13.Bh4 c5 14.dxc5 Nxc5 15.Nxc5 Bxc5 16.Bg3 . White's grip on e5 probably outweighs Black's bishop pair, centre and open f-file, B.Baker-C.Lakdawala, San Diego (rapid) 2006.

**11.Bxc6**

White enters a plan where the rewards are few and the aggravations many. He hands Black the bishop pair and weakens his light squares. If you are going to be miserable, then it's at least some consolation to be paid for it. White may as well grab a pawn by chopping e5, and then enduring Black's initiative.

NOTE: As Black, don't be afraid to gambit the d-pawn for a dangerous development lead after 11.dxe5 Ndxe5 12.Nxe5 Nxe5 13.Qxd5+ Be6 . For example, 14.Qe4 c6 15.Bd3?! (White should preserve his bishop by playing it to e2) 15...Nxd3 16.Qxd3 Rad8 17.Qe3? (17.Qe2 was necessary) 17...Bc4 18.Re1 Rde8 19.Qd2 , J.Arnold-C.Lakdawala, San Diego (rapid) 2010. Black has a winning attack after 19...Qh4 20.h3 Rxe1+ 21.Qxe1 Rxf2! , and if 22.Qxf2 Bh2+ 23.Kxh2 Qxf2 when ...Bf1 follows.

**11...bxc6 12.dxe5 Nxe5 13.Nxe5 Qxe5**

Threatening mate.

**14.f4 Qe7!**

Preventing Be3. It may appear as if my last move was careless, since it loses a tempo to a coming Re1. My move is a deliberate attempt to lure White's rook to e1, which leaves his f4-pawn weak.

14...Qf6 is met with 15.Be3 when White seizes control over the key d4- and c5-squares.

**15.Re1 Qh4**

Menacing f4.

**16.Nd4**

16.Rf1?! Ba6 17.Rf2 Rae8 18.Bd2 Re4 leaves White tangled up.

**16...Bg4 17.g3**

This forced weakening of the light squares becomes a parasitic drain on White's resources.

17.Qd2?? is met with 17...Bxf4 .

17.Ne2?? Bc5+ 18.Kh1 Rae8 19.Bd2 Qf2 and White loses a piece.

17.Nf3?? Bxf3 demolishes White's structure and leaves his king fatally exposed after 18.gxf3 .

**17...Qh5**

I'm playing for mate and didn't want to swap queens with 17...Bxd1 18.gxh4 c5 19.Nb5 Bc2 20.Nxd6 cxd6 21.Re6 Rad8 . Black stands better in the ending, due to the fact that White's structure and weak light squares gape like missing teeth.

**18.Qd3**

Advantage Black, for the following reasons:

1. The position resembles a Ruy Lopez Marshall Gambit, with the difference that Black isn't down a pawn in this version.

2. Black leads in development.

3. Black owns the bishop pair in an open position.

4. White's light squares weaknesses - much like sympathetic orphans in a Dickens novel - are everywhere.

5. The presence of number four on the list automatically means that White's king lives in an insecure, comfortless environment.

**18...c5 19.Nb5 Rae8 20.Be3 Rb8?!**

Threat: ...c4, winning White's knight.

I missed a tactical idea which wins a pawn after 20...Bxf4!! 21.Bxf4

(21.gxf4 Rf6 gives Black a winning attack)

21...Be2 22.Qd2

(22.Rxe2?? Rxe2 23.h4 c4 24.Qd1 Rxf4! and White can resign)

22...Bxb5 .

**21.Nxd6??**

WARNING: A sin of omission can be as harmful as taking inappropriate action.

There is a Latin phrase which translates to: "Our nightmares come softly."

This blunder - made with the incorrect assumption that Black would automatically recapture the knight - estranges White from hope. I can tell you from painful experience that in G/45 rapid battles, our treacherous hand sometimes grabs and moves our piece before our brain even has time to voice complaint.

Forced was 21.b3 , when White's position, although full of burden, remains salvageable.

**21...Rxb2**

A criminal finds anonymity within the crowded metropolis, rather than out in the countryside. White forgot about this zwischenzug, which wins a pawn and fatally threatens h2.

**22.h4**

White's bishop and h-pawn overlap functions, rendering one of them redundant: 22.Bf2? is met with 22...Rxf2! 23.Kxf2 Qxh2+ 24.Ke3 Qxg3+ 25.Kd2 Qf2+ 26.Re2 Qxf4+ when White can resign.

22.Bd2 (possibly White's best, in a miserable situation) 22...cxd6 leaves White down a pawn, with leaking light squares.

**22...cxd6 23.Bc1**

Awkward circumstances force our pieces into awkward angles.

**23...Be2! 24.Qe3 Re8! 25.Qf2!**

Accurate defence.

25.Qxe8+? Qxe8 26.Bxb2 Qe3+ 27.Kg2 Bf3+ 28.Kh3 Qf2 29.Rg1 (covering the mate threat on g2) 29...h5! forces mate.

**25...Rc2 26.f5**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Black has many ways to win. Do you see the flashiest way?

ANSWER: Overloaded defender.

**26...Bf3!**

By now White is wearily aware that his light squares leak. Despite what everyone says, I feel this move presents compelling evidence to support the claim that your writer is a genius, on par with Alekhine, Tal and Fischer.

Black can also win in mundane, non-genius ways with 26...Rxc3

or 26...Rf8 .

**27.Rxe8+ Qxe8**

Black's pieces hang, yet White can't touch any of them.

**28.Bd2**

Instead, 28.Qxc2?? walks into mate after 28...Qe1+ 29.Kh2 Qh1#

and nor can the bishop be taken: 28.Qxf3?? Qe1+ 29.Qf1 Qxg3+ 30.Kh1 Rh2# .

**28...Be4 29.Re1 Qf8 30.g4 h5**

Undermining.

**31.Rxe4 dxe4 32.g5 Qf7 33.g6 Qd5**

SUMMARY: The Guimard is an odd version of the French, where Black discards the usual ...c5, in favour of an ...f6 central pawn break.

**0-1**

### Baker,B. - Lakdawala,C. 27: San Diego (rapid), 2015

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2 Nc6 4.Ngf3 Nf6 5.e5 Nd7 6.Be2!**

NOTE: In my opinion this innocuous-looking move is White's most dangerous option.

White's other options: 6.Nb3 a5 7.a4 Be7 8.Bb5 Na7 9.Bd3

(Black gets huge play for the pawn after 9.Bxd7+ Bxd7 10.Nxa5 b6 11.Nb3 c5)

9...b6 10.O-O c5 (threat: ...c4) 11.c4 Bb7 with a satisfactory opening outcome for Black, who looks dynamically even.

6.Bb5 a6 7.Bxc6 bxc6 8.Nb3 c5 9.Bg5 Be7 10.Na5 (threatening to trap Black's queen) 10...Nxe5! 11.dxe5 Bxg5 12.Nc6 Qd7 13.Nxg5 h6

(White gets enough for the pawn after 13...Qxc6 14.Qh5)

14.Nxf7 Qxf7 when I like Black, who owns a greater share of the centre and also may generate play on the open b- and f-files.

**6...f6!?**

Safer and probably more sound is the line 6...Be7 7.Nf1 O-O 8.Ne3 f6 9.exf6 Nxf6 10.O-O Bd6 11.c4 b6 with a slight pull for White.

**7.exf6 Qxf6 8.Nf1!**

TIP: White's Nf1! and Ne3 manoeuvre is surprisingly effective against Black's ...e5 freeing idea in this line, since Black experiences difficulty in defending d5.

**8...e5?!**

In a flash, the game goes from rigidly structured to completely unplanned. When we wilfully push creativity's level up a notch, we risk eccentricity. Entry into this line strips both sides of civilization's trappings, only to establish solidarity with chaos and change. I decided that this is no time to be my normal weak-kneed craven self and play it safe. I knew this line is dubious, but was desperate for a win, praying that my opponent would be unfamiliar with the idea.

A far wiser course would have been 8...Bd6 9.Ne3 O-O 10.O-O Qg6 11.c4 Nf6 with a tiny yet nagging edge for White.

**9.dxe5?!**

When we go for the wrong plan, we misread the novel's plot, while misinterpreting the character's true motivations.

The complications of 9.Ne3! favour White after 9...e4 10.Nxd5 Qd6 : 11.c4!?

(11.Bc4! exf3 12.Bf4!? (the unruffled 12.O-O! favours White) 12...Qg6 13.Nxc7+ Kd8 14.gxf3?! (14.Qxf3! is tough for Black) 14...Nb6 15.Bd3 Qf7 16.Bg3 Na4! 17.Rb1 and I took the GM's draw offer in this messy position, S.Kudrin-C.Lakdawala, National Open 1990)

11...exf3 12.Bf4 fxg2!? (objectively better is to chop e2, followed by ...Nde5) 13.Rg1 Qxf4 14.Bh5+! (if White's knight takes the queen immediately, then Black plays ...Bb4+, winning White's queen) 14...g6 15.Nxf4 Bb4+ 16.Ke2 , D.Hart-C.Lakdawala, San Diego 1981. The computer claims White stands clearly better, but against a human, White's defensive task isn't so easy.

**9...Ndxe5 10.Qxd5!?**

WARNING: Pawn grabbing at the neglect of our development in the opening phase is the original sin, of which we are all occasionally guilty.

Is this pawn grab enterprising or greedy? I suspect it's a little bit of both, although I sense that it is weighted toward the latter! Now it's going to be a fight as close as the one between Luke Skywalker and his dad, Darth Vader, with the forces of light and darkness in their primes.

More circumspect is 10.Ne3 .

**10...Be6 11.Qb5 a6!**

Here I was tempted to feign shock (your writer is a GM-level feigner) at my 'blunder'.

**12.Qa4**

WARNING: When you bring your queen out early, be careful not to get it trapped.

12.Qxb7?? walks into Black's trap after 12...Ra7! when White's queen is lost. When we reflect back upon our mega-blunders, it turns our faces ruddy with shame.

**12...O-O-O**

Slightly more accurate is 12...Nxf3+! 13.Bxf3 O-O-O! , and if 14.Bxc6?? Rd4! unexpectedly traps White's queen (please see the above warning!).

**13.Nxe5 Qxe5**

Black got a big development lead for the pawn, enhanced by the fact that the position is wide open.

**14.c3 Bc5**

Theoretical novelties come as a shock, since the scrawny singular has the nerve to push aside weighty precedent. This move is new.

I considered too: 14...Nd4!? 15.cxd4 Rxd4 16.Qe8+ Rd8 17.Qa4 Rd4 is a draw, which I didn't want.

14...Bb4!? 15.cxb4 Bc4 16.Ne3 Bxe2 17.Kxe2 Nd4+ 18.Ke1 Rhe8 and Black got full attacking compensation for the invested piece, since White's king is relegated to an eternity in mid-board, S.Makarichev-R.Vaganian, Tbilisi 1973.

**15.Be3 Nb4!?**

Change, by its nature tends to only take two directions: progress or degeneration. Rarely do things remain the same after a radical shift in our lives.

TIP: When leading in development, you must create confrontation, or your opponent will catch up in development. I would be lying through my molars if I told you I was confident of victory here. This sacrifice, which hovers uneasily between viable and unviable, is the dry run to the attack which follows.

**16.cxb4**

White decides to revive the custom of killing the messenger of ill tidings.

16.Bxc5?? Nd3+ 17.Kd2 Nf4+! 18.Kc2 Qxe2+ forces mate in three moves.

**16...Qxb2 17.bxc5!?**

My opponent may be playing for the full point.

Safer is 17.Rd1 .

**17...Qxa1+ 18.Bd1 Bd7**

Preventing White's disruptive c6 ideas.

**19.Qc2 Rhe8 20.Nd2 Bb5**

Oh, no you don't. White's king is denied safety via castling. White is up material, with two pieces for Black's lone rook, yet Black gets full compensation from the fact that White's harassed king is caught in the middle. Such positions also take a toll on the defending side's clock, especially in a G/45 rapid battle.

**21.Nb3 Qe5?!**

I bumblingly managed to turn my position into one of those perilous on again, off again initiatives. Technically this is an inaccuracy, since the best course is to take a draw.

I considered 21...Rxd1+!? 22.Qxd1 Qxa2 23.Nd4 Qa5+ 24.Qd2 Qa1+ 25.Qd1 Qc3+ , but I somewhat irrationally rejected this line because my tournament situation demanded that I go for the full point.

**22.Be2 Bxe2 23.Kxe2?!**

Correct was 23.Qxe2! Qc3+ 24.Kf1 . All the entry squares are covered in White's camp and his king will soon be released after g3 and Kg2, with a clear advantage for White.

**23...Qh5+ 24.Ke1**

24.f3?? loses instantly to 24...Qg5 with a double attack on e3 and g2.

**24...Qd5 25.Rg1 Qh5 26.c6!?**

NOTE: True and false can only be demonstrated in variations which assert mathematical reality. The argument becomes blurred when stylistic preferences come into play. I think it was Oscar Wilde who quipped that Truth is synonymous with one's current mood.

My opponent takes a jaundiced view to going on the defensive, refusing to sentimentalize, and allowing his h-pawn to fall. Two players can be handed the same problem, and tackle it in opposing directions. To me this initiative-at-all-cost move looks like misplaced generosity.

I would have played the calmer 26.h3 .

**26...Qxh2 27.cxb7+ Kb8**

TIP: In situations like this, don't capture the enemy pawn, which serves as a human shield for your king, since it clogs White's attacking lanes.

**28.Rf1**

28.Kf1?? allows 28...Rxe3 29.fxe3 Rf8+ and Black wins.

**28...Qxg2 29.Qc5!**

A multipurpose move, threatening mate, forcing Black's king to take the b7-pawn to open lines, and also covering e3.

**29...Qxb7 30.Rg1 Rd6 31.Qc2?!**

It's inaccurate to allow Black's queen to activate.

He was better off shifting the queen to c4, but 31.Rxg7?? walks into the trap 31...Qh1+ 32.Ke2 Qd1# .

**31...Qb4+ 32.Kf1?**

32.Nd2 was forced.

**32...Qb5+?**

I mislay the correct move in some hard-to-find nook.

32...Rxe3! 33.fxe3 Qh4! gives Black a winning attack.

**33.Ke1 Red8?!**

When we attempt to lead our nebulous attack on, it can feel like one of Hannibal's elephants crossing the snowy Alps, praying to make it to sunny Italy without freezing to death first.

I should simply protect my g-pawn with 33...g6! with an edge.

**34.f3?!**

A low clock distorts our critical faculties.

There was nothing wrong with grabbing with 34.Rxg7! .

**34...Qe5 35.Kf2 Qh2+ 36.Rg2 Qh4+ 37.Ke2 g6?!**

37...Rd1! 38.Rf2 Qh1 39.Bd2 Qg1 leaves White under tremendous strain. He is unable to take the rook: 40.Qxd1?? walks into 40...Re8+ 41.Be3 Rxe3+ , overloading White's king after 42.Kd2 Rd3+ .

**38.Qc5 Kc8 39.Nd2 Qh1 40.Rg4??**

40.Rf2 was forced.

**40...Qh2+**

The queen, convulsed in laughter and doubled over, begs her e2 brother to stop with his joke, which was: "Will you grant me a pardon?".

40...Qh2+ 41.Kf1 Rxd2 42.Bxd2 Rxd2 threatens ...Rd1 mate and leaves White helpless.

SUMMARY: In my opinion Black isn't able to fully equalize after the innocuous looking, yet strong 6 Be2! line.

**0-1**

## 5: The Advance Variation

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5**

In this chapter we examine the Advance line in its many permutations. After 3 e5, White's pawns move south, like migrating fowl. Unlike the Classical line, which gains a tempo on Black's f6-knight, and unlike the Winawer, where White is induced into e5 since Black's b4-bishop pin threatens e4, White in the Advance line plays e5 voluntarily, fixing the structure and seizing central/kingside space.

A good haggler begins the negotiation at the lowest possible price, allowing the price to rise only to the level of what he or she wanted all along. In compensation for White's territorial advantage, our source of counterplay is White's d4-pawn, the lowest attackable base of our opponent's chain, which we pressure with ideas like ...c5, ...Nc6, ...cxd4,...Qb6, ...Nh6, and ...Nf5, where our goal is to tie White down to defence of d4. If we accomplish this, our opponent experiences difficulty in generating the hoped for kingside attack. A warning: if we fail to tie our opponent down to defence of d4, we get oppressed by White's space and begin to feel like the galley slave, forced to row 12 hours a day, seven days a week, while being arbitrarily lashed every half hour.

### Nimzowitsch,A. - Hakansson,A. 28: 1st matchgame, Kristianstad, 1922

Some of my students mistakenly look down on the study of our chess forefathers, interpreting old games as a modern day cardiologist who continues to prescribe eye of newt and toe of frog for the patient's heart condition. There is a lot we can still learn from the old lions. Black's play this game is a blueprint of how not to play this line. We are reminded of those awful singers in the early episodes of American Idol, where the real charm lies in the fact that these atrocious singers believe they all warble like songbirds.

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5**

The Advance Variation, where White's open intention is to grab territory and squeeze Black into submission.

**3...c5**

As always, we hit back against White's centre on the wings.

**4.Qg4!?**

DID YOU KNOW? This line, which has fallen into disrepute, is the original copy, while our modern more accurate interpretations are in reality simulacrums of our forefathers' labours.

What quality makes a chess idea poor, powerful or indifferent? The answer may be contained within two variables: originality and accuracy. I get the feeling White's move contains an abundance of the former, while not so much with the latter! When we take such an unnatural route, we feel the creeping allusion to Dr. Frankenstein and his creature, which he was unable to control, and who in the end turned wrathfully upon its owner.

I don't think this is all that great a line for White, but if you are unfamiliar with it as Black, you can turn blue from lack of air, as was demonstrated in this game. White violates the opening's prime directive, which is to develop rapidly, and jumps his queen out to an aggressive post on g4, which restricts Black since it ties the dark-squared bishop to defence of g7. White's cost, however, feels prohibitive, since he allows Black ...cxd4, diminishing his centre, while wasting time on a non-developing move.

Instead, 4.dxc5 should be met with 4...Nc6

(I would avoid 4...Bxc5 5.Qg4)

5.Nf3 Bxc5 6.Bd3 Nge7 7.O-O Ng6 8.Re1 Qc7 9.Qe2 .

TIP: Remember the following manoeuvre which secures Black the bishop pair and rids White of a promising attacking piece.

After 9...Nd4! 10.Nxd4 Bxd4 the e5-pawn is attacked three times, while defended only once. On top of this, White is denied both Bf4, since it hangs a piece, and f4, since it is an illegal move! Following 11.Bxg6 (a painful yet forced concession from White) 11...hxg6 I already prefer Black's game, since White was forced to part with his potent light-squared bishop.

In the remaining games of the chapter we look at White's main line, 4.c3 .

**4...cxd4**

4...Nc6 5.Nf3 cxd4 transposes to the game.

**5.Nf3 Nc6 6.Bd3**

NOTE: White's intention is to at least temporarily sacrifice d4, while using e5 as a vehicle to squeeze Black.

**6...f5!?**

WARNING: Just remember: if you play an early ...f5, this means that ...f6 - one of Black's most important breaks in the French - is eliminated for good.

This move is played quite often, yet I'm convinced it's inaccurate.

My recipe against Nimzo's line goes 6...Qc7 7.Qg3 Nge7 8.O-O Ng6 9.Re1 Nb4! (I give up the rather worthless d4-pawn to pick off White's light-squared bishop, the most potent attacker) 10.Nxd4 Nxd3 11.cxd3 Bd7 . I slightly prefer Black here, since White's attacking chances have been greatly reduced through the exchange of his d3-bishop. Moreover, in this instance White's h4 isn't all that effective since 12.h4 is comfortably met with 12...h5 .

**7.Qg3 Nge7 8.O-O Ng6?!**

WARNING: If you mistime an early placement of Black's knight on g6, Black walks into White's h4-h5 tempo/space gaining manoeuvre.

Black should go for a set-up like 8...Bd7 9.a3 a5 (suppressing b4) 10.Nbd2 Qb6 11.Re1 h6 12.h4 Kf7 , although even here I slightly prefer White.

**9.h4 Qc7 10.Re1 Bd7?!**

Better is 10...Bb4! 11.c3!

(Black looks better after 11.Nbd2?! O-O)

11...dxc3 12.bxc3 Ba5 13.h5 Nf8 14.Rd1 Rg8 15.Na3 a6 16.c4 g5! with a messy game where White probably gets enough compensation for the invested pawn.

**11.a3**

WARNING: Just because you see a combination, doesn't mean you should always play it. Correct assessment of the aftermath is every bit as important as the actual calculation.

11.Bxf5? is overly clever: 11...exf5 12.e6 Qxg3 13.exd7+ Kxd7 14.fxg3 Bd6 with a clear advantage for Black in the ending.

**11...O-O-O 12.b4 a6?!**

A violation of the principle: avoid unnecessary pawn weakness around your king.

Black was better off with 12...Kb8 .

**13.h5 Nge7 14.Bd2!**

With this move Nimzo sets his narrative in motion. The move appears unnatural, since it blocks d2 as a development square for the b1-knight, yet White has two subtle ideas embedded within it:

1. White plans a4 and b5, prying open the queenside. To accomplish this, he must reinforce b4.

2. White contemplates a line opening sacrifice c2-c3.

**14...h6 15.a4! g5**

This move essentially closes the kingside, which favours White.

He should probably try 15...Be8 16.Qh2 g6 .

**16.b5**

TIP: Avoid moves which violate the principle of not allowing lines to open around your king.

After 16.hxg6?! Rg8 Black is still in trouble, but perhaps better off than in the game's continuation.

**16...f4 17.Qg4 Nb8?**

He should have played his knight to a5.

**18.c3!**

A powerful line opening.

**18...Re8**

Not 18...dxc3?? 19.Nxc3 and Black has no good response to a coming white rook to c1.

**19.cxd4 Kd8 20.Rc1 Qb6 21.a5 Qa7 22.b6 Qa8**

Boy, talk about dereliction of duty.

**23.Rc7 Nf5 24.Nc3 Be7**

A mistake in an already hopeless situation.

**25.Nxd5!**

Undermining f5. Now the defence's muscle tone resembles overcooked angel hair pasta.

**25...Nxd4**

This isn't exactly a punishing counterblow. On our evening walks, an irascible Chihuahua with a death wish barks her head off at my 90-pound behemoth Akita Emma, who refuses to dignify her runty rival with even a mild 'woof' as a response. Moral: it's unwise to provoke a showdown with an enemy who is capable of killing you in a single bite.

**26.Nxd4 exd5**

EXERCISE (combination alert): A conspiracy theorist tends to uncover plots which have no existence outside of the paranoid mind. In this instance, however, Black has good reason for paranoia. How did Nimzowitsch put Herr. Hakansson out of his misery?

ANSWER: Queen sacrifice/removal of the guard/smothered mate.

**27.Qxd7+!**

When we are lucky enough to enter that realm called 'the zone', we magically transform into Michael Jordan in the NBA finals.

27.Qxd7+! Nxd7 28.Ne6# is a pretty smothered mate.

SUMMARY: Don't underestimate the ancient 4 Qg4 line. My preference against the set-up is the plan ...Qc7, ...Nge7, ...Ng6, ...Nb4! and ...Nxd3, removing White's most potent attacker.

**1-0**

### Sevillano,E. - Lakdawala,C. 29: San Diego (rapid), 2006

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 Qb6 6.a3**

NOTE: How can White indulge in a non-developing move like this? The reason is the position is blocked for now, so quality tends to outweigh quantity in such cases.

White wants to play b4 to resolve central tension.

**6...Nh6**

Black allows White to play b4, while increasing his development lead and intending ...cxd4 and ...Nf5, which pressures d4.

Alternatively: 6...c4 is Black's main line, which we look at next game.

After 6...a5!? I think White gets a favourable version of the Milner-Barry Gambit, which we look at later in the chapter: 7.Bd3! . Now if 7...cxd4?! 8.cxd4 Bd7 9.Bc2! White gets all the benefits of the Milner-Barry Gambit, except without being down a pawn.

**7.b4**

WARNING: White pays a high price to ease the pressure on d4, by handing over the precious light-squared bishop.

WARNING: 7.Bxh6? is a blunder, which is met with the zwischenzug 7...Qxb2 8.Bxg7 Bxg7 9.Nbd2 f6! and White's centre collapses.

Also seen is 7.Bd3 cxd4 8.cxd4 Nf5 9.Bxf5 exf5 10.Nc3 Be6 when Black stands no worse.

**7...cxd4 8.cxd4**

8.Bxh6 is playable, now that b2 isn't loose, although after 8...gxh6 9.cxd4 Bd7 10.Be2 Rc8 11.O-O Bg7 12.Qd2 O-O 13.Ra2 f6 Black achieves good play against White's centre.

**8...Nf5 9.Bb2**

9.Be3 f6!? 10.exf6 gxf6 11.Bd3 Nxe3 12.fxe3 Bh6 13.Qe2 O-O and my preference is for Black, who owns the bishop pair and dark-square control. I don't believe White's slight attacking chances fully make up for it.

**9...Bd7 10.Bc3?!**

A dubious idea, after which White's prospects become as thin as Audrey Hepburn. Sevillano wants to kill Black's ...Na5 tactic, but in doing so he clogs his queenside development. The funny thing is in the database, this move has been played five time so far with White wining all five games! Yet I still declare to you that White's move is weak.

Better is 10.g4 Nfe7 11.Nc3 .

TIP: In such positions Black has access to a little tactic which allows the c6-knight entry to c4, with 11...Na5! . Here White should probably avoid 12.Na4?! Qc6! 13.Nc5 Nc4 14.Bc3 h5 when I prefer Black's game.

**10...h5**

Preventing g4. Now White is unable to develop with Nd2.

**11.h4 Rc8 12.Qd2!**

Oh you sneaky so and so! White sets up a trap. When we recognize our opponent attempting to set us up in a vulgar swindle, we are reminded of The Shadow, who wisely stated: "Who knows what evil lurks in the heart of men?".

**12...a6**

This move prevents the trap 12...Be7?? , which is what my opponent was praying for: 13.b5 Nb8 14.Ba5 and now Black is obliged to hand over material to extricate his queen, with 14...Rc1+ 15.Qxc1 Qxa5+ 16.Qd2 with an extra exchange for White.

**13.Qb2**

Or if 13.Bd3 Be7!

(not 13...Nfxd4? 14.Nxd4 Nxd4 15.Qe3! and White wins material)

14.g3 Na7! 15.O-O Bb5 with a clear strategic advantage for Black.

**13...Na7!**

Black's idea slowly unfurls. When a player lacks skills with initiative or attack (i.e. your unfortunate writer), he or she tends to develop compensating skills (strategic understanding and recognition of weak squares), the way a blind person may develop enhanced auditory and tactile skills. I intend to grab the queenside light squares with ...Ba4 and ...Nb5.

**14.Bd3**

Enrico's hand hovered over his a-pawn but then jerked back with a shock, when he registered my trap: 14.a4?? Rxc3! 15.Nxc3 Nxd4 and White's position is collapsing on the dark squares.

**14...Ba4**

The not-so-bad, bad bishop finds gainful employment on a4.

**15.O-O Be7 16.g3 Nb5**

Pile up a lot of little issues and we end up with a big problem:

1. Note the pied piper quality to Black's pieces, who all follow the light squares.

2. White's klutzy, tied-down pieces are centreless entities, made up of random parts which don't seem to fit.

3. d4 is under heavy pressure, as is c3.

4. White must watch out for a future ...Bb5, swapping away the light-squared bishops, which leaves White with a remaining bad bishop.

5. Black has a simple plan of doubling or even tripling major pieces on the c-file.

**17.Qd2! O-O**

17...Nbxd4?? walks into the elementary trap 18.Nxd4 Nxd4 19.Bxd4 Qxd4 20.Bb5+ .

**18.Bb2 Rc6**

Preparing to triple on the c-file.

**19.Nc3!**

He must try and shake the light-squared bind.

**19...Nxc3**

19...Nfxd4?! allows White to escape the bind after 20.Nxd4 Nxd4 21.Qe3 Bb3 22.Nxd5 Bxd5 23.Bxd4 .

**20.Bxc3 Bb5!**

TIP: In many French lines where White's central pawns are fixed on d4 and e5, the exchange of light-squared bishops ensures that White remains with his miserable dark-square model.

**21.Rfc1 Bxd3 22.Qxd3**

Now White's strategic expenses on the vulnerable light squares balloon like a tuba player's cheeks.

**22...Rfc8 23.Bb2 Qb5?**

A well intentioned idea backfires if we get the move order wrong. When we believe we have the game wrapped up we would be wise to recall Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

23...Rc4! leaves White in a bad way, since he is unable to challenge the rook with 24.Nd2? Rxc1+ 25.Bxc1 Qxd4 26.Qxd4 Nxd4 with a clean pawn up for Black in the ending, and with White's pieces remaining in a tangle.

**24.Qxb5 axb5 25.Rxc6 Rxc6 26.Rc1 Rc4**

Black can't make progress since White just brings his king to d3.

**27.Kf1 Kf8 28.Ke2 Ke8 29.Kd3 Kd7 30.Nd2**

The spectre of inferiority has passed, as White's once overwhelming strategic maladies subside to tolerable levels.

**30...Rc6 31.Rxc6 bxc6**

SUMMARY: When White plays 6 a3, I respond with 6...Nh6, allowing White b4. Black gets adequate counterplay by hammering away at d4.

**1/2-1/2**

### Grischuk,A. - Vitiugov,N. 30: Russian Championship, Moscow, 2010

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.c3 Qb6 5.Nf3 Nc6 6.a3 c4**

NOTE: Black suppresses White's b4 idea, while gaining space on the queenside.

**7.Nbd2 Na5**

Black zeroes in on the b3 hole.

**8.g3 Bd7 9.Bg2**

NOTE: Sometimes White plays 9.h4 to post the bishop on h3, in an attempt to suppress Black's f6 ideas.

After 9...O-O-O 10.Bh3 f5 11.exf6 (otherwise White's bishop makes no sense on h3) 11...gxf6 12.O-O a sharp position arises with mutual chances. As yet it is undetermined if Black's central pawns represent a strength or a weakness.

**9...O-O-O**

With this move the two camps take paths which are mutually contradictory. So we reach opposite wings castling, with issues for both sides:

1. Black can play for a kingside attack, but this isn't so easy, since any kingside pawn moves tend to create weakness in Black's camp.

2. If White tries to attack Black's king, playing for the b3 break, this comes with a high risk, since Black's c-pawn will take it. This leads to an open b-file for White's attack, but it also means c3 is a potentially weak backward pawn on the open c-file. Also, Black may be able to utilize the vacancy on c4 with something like ...Rc8 and ...Nc4.

**10.O-O f5**

This move is book, but I think it's a tad early.

I would play it more cautiously, keeping the centre closed with a line like 10...h6 11.Rb1 Ne7 12.Re1 Kb8 .

**11.exf6**

This move opens the g-file for Black and also enhances Black's central control. Yet it also allows White to create a target of e6 and opens the e-file to enhance pressure on Black's centre.

**11...gxf6 12.Re1 Bd6**

I suspect this natural move may be the start of Black's troubles.

He was better off playing 12...Nh6 13.Rb1 Nf5 14.b4! cxb3 15.Nxb3 Ba4 16.Nfd2 when Black reaches a superior version of what he got in the game.

**13.Bh3**

Increasing the pressure on e6.

**13...Bc7?!**

Black doesn't yet sense the danger on his e6-pawn.

He should try 13...Re8 .

**14.Rb1!**

White toys with b3 ideas, which are surprisingly potent here.

**14...Kb8 15.b4!**

There is but a thin partition between desire and doing.

NOTE: When White plays the weakening/attacking move b4 in this line, the conflict tends to escalate to a point past feasible resolution, and one of the parties tends to be proven the loser in the exchange.

This move opens lines against Black's king, at the cost of weakening the c3-pawn and the c4-square, which in some cases resemble people who are left stunted by a childhood illness. In this particular case, the benefits for White outweigh costs.

**15...cxb3**

Not much choice since 15...Nc6?? hangs a key pawn after 16.Bxe6 .

**16.Nxb3 Ne7**

I'm not sure if White's last move should be celebrated, or fretted over.

The question is: can Black give up e6 to tie White down in a pin with 16...Ba4 - ? The idea is tempting, yet analysis proves that the resulting complications favour White after 17.Rxe6! Bxb3

(17...Qb5 18.Nfd2 leaves White up a pawn, with Black unable to exploit the b3 pin)

18.Qd3! (this queen is no obedient hand maiden, as she cuts off ...Qb5 for Black's queen.) 18...Rd6

(18...Bc4 19.Qf5!)

19.Re8+ Rd8 20.Rxd8+ Bxd8 21.Nd2 Bc4?

(correct is the rather defeatist line 21...Ne7 22.Nxb3 Nxb3 23.Qd1 ; White regains the lost piece with interest, remaining a pawn up, with the bishop pair)

22.Nxc4 dxc4 23.Qe4 Qc6 24.Bf4+ Ka8 25.d5 Qc5

(25...Qa4 26.Qe6 Ne7 27.d6 is decisive)

26.Qe8 Qxd5 27.Bg2 Qd3 28.Be4 . Black loses heavy material, since his queen is out of safe squares and can no longer protect the d8-bishop.

**17.Nfd2 Qc6**

17...Nxb3 18.Nxb3 Bc8 19.Bd2 Qc6 20.Nc5 Nf5 21.Qf3! leaves Black without a good response to the coming undermining Nxe6! trick.

**18.Nc5**

Black is in a bad way, under pressure on e6 and b7.

**18...Nf5 19.Ndb3 Nxb3**

Avoiding 19...Nc4?? 20.Nxd7+ Rxd7 21.Nc5 with simultaneous attacks on b7, d7 and e6.

**20.Qxb3 b6**

If we must turn the other cheek, then do it to minimize the coming blow.

Better was to avoid weakening his king's pawn front with 20...Bb6 .

**21.a4!**

Intending to strip Black's king with a5.

**21...Bc8 22.a5 e5**

Principle: meet a wing attack with a central counter. In this case Black's play comes too late.

**23.axb6 axb6 24.Ba3?**

EXERCISE (combination alert): White's last move allowed Black a shot which gets him back into the game. How?

White remains in full control after 24.Bg2! .

**24...Nh4!**

ANSWER: Discovered attack/knight fork.

How wonderful when the messiah swoops down from the heavens to save us. This shot dismantles the apparatus of White's attack.

**25.Bg2**

Covering the f3 fork square at the high cost of handing to Black control over the light squares;

but if: 25.gxh4? Bxh3 26.Re3 Bf5 leaves Black better.

25.Bxc8? Nf3+ 26.Kh1 Kxc8! 27.Na6 Nxe1 28.Rxe1 and White lacks compensation for the exchange.

**25...Nxg2 26.Kxg2**

Deprived of his light-squared bishop, White's attack is suddenly naked of its former magic.

**26...Rde8?!**

There was no reason to move the already well posted rook.

**27.Na4!**

Targeting b6.

**27...exd4 28.Rxe8?!**

28.Rec1! d3 29.Nxb6 is clearly in White's favour.

**28...Rxe8 29.cxd4**

Black looks fine here, until his next move.

**29...Re6?**

White's probing serves its purpose in provoking a meek response. Now Black's game ages before our eyes, the way a U.S. president's hair greys after an eight-year term.

Black should avoid defending b6 and step around the problem with the counterattacking 29...Bf5! 30.Rc1 Qe6 . Black's light-square counterplay makes up for his weak king.

**30.Bc5!**

White's pieces view the weak b-pawn, as if it were a bug under a microscope.

**30...b5 31.Nc3**

Black must allow his b-pawn to go with regrettable finality.

**31...Ba6 32.Nxb5 Bxb5 33.Qxb5+ Qxb5 34.Rxb5+**

The ending is lost for Black, who is down a pawn and nurses an all-isolani hospital ward.

**34...Kc8 35.Bf8**

The profit-hungry white pieces pick up a second pawn.

**35...Bb6 36.Rxd5**

SUMMARY: 6...c4 divides the board and leads to a sharp opposite wings castling position.

**1-0**

### Shirov,A. - Ivanchuk,V. 31: Monaco (blindfold), 2005

Believe it or not, the cleanest example I found for Black's thematic strategy in this next line was from a blindfold/rapid game!

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.c3 Qb6 5.Nf3 Nc6 6.Be2**

This is the modest approach. White develops the bishop to a square which doesn't hinder control over d4, and prepares to castle.

**6...cxd4!**

Why resolve the central tension? It prepares ...Nh6, which doesn't work as well if Black refuses to toss in 6...cxd4: for example, 6...Nh6 7.Bxh6! . This time White can chop the knight. Now Black should simply recapture on h6, as if 7...Qxb2 8.Be3! White sacrifices an exchange and pawn to try and trap Black's queen: 8...Qxa1 9.Qc2! cxd4 10.Nxd4 (threat: Nb3) 10...Ba3

(or 10...Nxd4 11.Bxd4 Ba3 12.Bb5+ Kf8 13.O-O Qb2 14.Bc5+! Kg8 15.Nxa3 and Black is busted)

11.Nb5! Bb2 12.Bc5! (this is stronger than the c7 fork) 12...Qxa2 13.O-O and White had a winning attack, H.Sorensen-Juoma, correspondence 1973.

**7.cxd4 Nh6**

Intending ...Nf5, increasing the pressure on d4.

**8.Nc3**

Alternatively: 8.Bxh6 and this time Black can play the zwischenzug and take b2: 8...Qxb2! 9.Nbd2

(9.Bd2? Qxa1 10.O-O Qb2 11.Nc3 Qb6 12.Qa4 Be7 13.Rb1 Qd8 left White with insufficient compensation for the sacrificed material, C.Milton-C.Lakdawala, San Diego (rapid) 2008)

9...gxh6 10.O-O Nxd4 11.Nxd4 Qxd4 12.Bb5+ Kd8 13.Qe2 Rg8 . My preference is for Black, who is up a pawn, with a relatively safe king, E.Bajaramov-A.Alavkin, St Petersburg 2009.

8.b3 has the intention of defending d4, via a b2 fianchetto: 8...Nf5 9.Bb2 Bb4+! (this move forces White to move the king, since any block hangs the d4-pawn) 10.Kf1 O-O 11.g4 Nh6 12.Rg1 f6 13.exf6 Rxf6! (you can recapture with the g-pawn, but I prefer this exchange sacrifice, for which Black gets promising compensation) 14.g5 Rxf3 15.Bxf3 Nf5 16.Rg4 Bd7 and to my mind Black has huge compensation for the exchange:

1. d4 is under pressure and White's pieces are tied down in defence of the pawn.

2. White's king is insecure.

3. White's game has an overextended feel, since he remains weak on virtually every square along the f-file.

**8...Nf5**

Adding a third attacker on d4.

**9.Na4**

This deflects some of the pressure on d4, at the cost of time for White.

**9...Qa5+ 10.Bd2 Bb4 11.Bc3**

White must continue to cover d4.

**11...b5! 12.a3**

Forced, as after 12.Bxb4? Qxb4+ 13.Nc3 Ncxd4 Black wins a key pawn.

**12...Bxc3+ 13.Nxc3 b4 14.axb4 Qxb4**

Attacks are renewed on d4 and b2.

**15.Bb5**

The idea is to chop the c6-knight to relieve the pressure to d4.

White's alternative is to hang on to his bishop with the line 15.Qa4 Bd7 16.Qxb4 Nxb4 . I slightly prefer Black even here.

**15...Bd7 16.Bxc6 Bxc6**

Theory considers this position even, while I feel that Black holds a slight yet nagging edge, since White's pawn weaknesses, much like an alcoholic's liver, enlarge with time.

NOTE: I know what you are thinking: 'No honest person can describe Black's bad bishop as handsome.' Don't be afraid to take on a bad bishop as Black here.

First of all, it's not such a bad piece, since White tends to be weak on the light squares. Secondly, White is tied down to defence of d4 and b2, which tends to hinder kingside attacking ambitions.

**17.Qd2 O-O 18.O-O Rfb8**

Black utilizes the open b-file to apply pressure to b2.

**19.Rab1 Rb6 20.Rfc1 Rab8 21.Rc2 h6 22.g3**

The conservative approach.

22.g4!? is double-edged, and a move made with the thought: to attack effectively, we must renounce allegiance with the strategic. White is perhaps more likely to overextend than he is to deliver checkmate to Black.

**22...a5 23.Kg2 a4 24.Ra1 Be8 25.h3 Bd7 26.Rac1 Rc6 27.g4!?**

One of beatitudes tells us that if we expect no reward in life, we will never be disappointed. White tires of passive defence and goes for it against Black's king. In this game, however, White got the worst of both worlds, with a lousy pawn structure, and a non-attack left with the feel of something unfinished.

**27...Ne7 28.Ra1 Rc4**

Covering a4, while continuing to chip away at d4.

**29.Ra2 Qb6 30.Rc1 Rb4 31.Rca1 Ng6**

31...Rxb2?! falls into White's mini-trap after 32.Rxb2 Qxb2 33.Rb1! Qxb1 34.Nxb1 Rxb1 . I think only White has the winning chances here.

**32.Nd1 Bb5!**

The much maligned bad bishop emerges. Now White must factor in ...Bc4 ideas.

**33.Nc3 Qd8 34.Kg3**

Preventing ...Nh4+ ideas.

**34...Bc4 35.Rxa4 Rxb2 36.Qe3 R2b3**

White may have rid himself of his weak b-pawn, yet hasn't equalized, for the following factors.

1. Defence of d4 remains an anxiety.

2 White's king remains insecure.

3. White's c3-knight is unpleasantly pinned.

**37.R1a3 Qe7**

Stronger was 37...f5! (threat: ...f4+) 38.gxf5 Rxa3 39.Rxa3 Qf8! 40.Na4 Qxf5 and White's king is in serious trouble.

**38.Rxb3 Rxb3 39.Ra1?**

A remediable disease, when left untreated, may turn fatal. This move allows Black's queen access to b4.

Correct was 39.Kh2 .

**39...Qb4 40.Rc1**

White's pieces are steadily shoved to the margins.

**40...Ne7 41.Nd2 Ra3 42.f3 Nc6 43.Nxc4 dxc4**

Add a passed c-pawn to Black's strategic plusses.

**44.Qd2 Qa5 45.h4 Rb3 46.h5**

White will never get a chance to play g5 going after Black's king, since White is too tied down to defence of his knight.

**46...Qd8 47.Rd1 Nb4 48.Ra1 Nd3**

Attacking d4.

**49.Ne2**

EXERCISE (combination alert): White's forces have a look of hopeless fragmentation. How did Black win material?

ANSWER: Pin.

**49...Nxe5! 50.Qa5**

There is an old saying which goes: if you and your friends get run out of town, then your best bet is to get in front and make it appear that you lead a parade. This move allows f3 to fall as well.

**50...Qxa5 51.Rxa5 Nxf3**

Black's position exudes a feel of moneyed ease, as a second pawn falls.

**52.Nc1 Rb1**

SUMMARY: Against 6.Be2, our plan is to hammer away at d4, with 6...cxd4 and 7...Nh6, intending 8...Nf5.<level value="+2"/><level start="7...Nh6" value="-1"/><level start="8...Nf5" value="-2"/>

**0-1**

### Bastijanic,D. - Dizdar,G. 32: Pula, 1993

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bd7**

The 5...Qb6 move order runs 6.Bd3 cxd4 7.cxd4 Bd7

(WARNING: Don't, however, fall for 7...Nxd4?? 8.Nxd4 and if Black attempts to regain the lost piece with 8...Qxd4?? the queen hangs after the discovered check 9.Bb5+ .)

8.O-O Nxd4 , transposing to the game.

**6.Bd3?!**

NOTE: Noble intentions don't always translate into effective solutions. White's coming gambit, like desire, is founded in lack.

The d3 placement of the bishop leads to the Milner-Barry Gambit, where White issues an imperious challenge, offering the d4-pawn for a development lead. In my opinion, and with the help of comps, the gambit is borderline, if not outright unsound, since White labours under an industrial lack: Black's defenders are manufactured and replaced faster than White's coming threats.

**6...cxd4 7.cxd4 Qb6 8.O-O**

A move made with the philosophy: transformation isn't possible by only minor adjustments. All material concerns are remorselessly ignored in pursuit of initiative/attack.

WARNING: You may ask: why give away an important central pawn, when White can simply shift the bishop to c2, which protects d4? The problem with this plan is that White loses the initiative after 8.Bc2?! Nb4! going after White's powerful light-squared bishop.

Now the trouble is if White attempts to hang on to it with 9.Bb3? then 9...Qa6! is a huge problem for White, who loses control over the central light squares.

**8...Nxd4**

I suggest we chop the d-pawn, since computer analysis puts White's compensation in the 'iffy' category.

**9.Nxd4 Qxd4**

The queen acts autonomously, picking off d4 at the cost of time.

**10.Nc3**

Our starting position of the gambit. The players' itineraries push them in opposite directions. White offers a second pawn, increasing his development lead, while toying with Nb5 ideas.

**10...a6!**

TIP: Our secret to overcoming the Milner-Barry gambit is to accept the first pawn, and then decline the second.

Dangerous is 10...Qxe5!? 11.Re1 with open lines and an alarming development lead for the two sacrificed pawns. Objectively, this position is still fine for Black according to the computers. From a human perspective, it's not such an easy job to defend.

**11.Qe2**

White defends e5, while clearing the way for Rd1.

**11...Ne7**

The idea is to play to c6, which pressures e5, while unclogging Black's kingside development.

**12.Kh1**

Unpinning, in preparation for f4.

Alternatively, 12.Rd1 (threat: Bxa6) 12...Nc6! (ignoring it) 13.Bxa6 Qxe5 14.Bxb7 Qxe2 15.Nxe2 Rb8 16.Bxc6

(16.Ba6 Nb4 forces White to part with the light-squared bishop in any case)

16...Bxc6 with a clear advantage for Black, who owns the bishop pair, a superior central pawn majority, and an already centralized king.

**12...Nc6 13.f4 Nb4!**

This disruptive idea gains time for Black.

**14.Bb1**

In a position where time is White's most precious resource, he seems to be squandering a lot of it away. Attack/initiative is often the flip side of being down material, but not here. White is deprived of even the small consolation of a temporary initiative. The bishop is sent away in disgrace, since handing it over greatly reduces White's attacking chances.

After 14.Rd1 Nxd3 15.Rxd3 Qb6 16.Be3 Bc5 17.Bxc5 Qxc5 18.f5 Bc6 White lacks full compensation for the pawn, although this may be marginally better than the game's continuation.

**14...Qc4!**

TIP: The material-up side can sometimes bully the opponent into backing down, by continually threatening to swap pieces - especially queens.

**15.Qd1**

It's a bad sign when the gambiting side steadily retreats.

15.Qf3 is also met with 15...d4! .

**15...d4!**

Multipurpose:

1. Black's d-pawn has a choking influence on White's game.

2. Black's light-squared bishop is activated via c6.

**16.Ne4 d3**

Cutting off the connection to White's knight.

**17.Nc3**

17.Nd6+ Bxd6 18.exd6 Rc8 19.Bd2 Nc2 20.Bxc2 dxc2 21.Qe1 Bc6 leaves White a pawn down, with Black holding the initiative.

**17...Bc6 18.Be3 Rd8**

So far the gambit gets only failing marks:

1. White remains down a pawn.

2. Black owns the initiative.

3. Black's d-pawn ties White's pieces down to defence, while clogging queenside development.

Conclusion: White is busted.

**19.a3 Nd5 20.Nxd5 Qxd5 21.Qd2**

Covering the mate on g2, while blockading Black's d-pawn.

**21...Bc5 22.Bxc5 Qxc5 23.Ba2**

23.Bxd3?? walks into a decisive pin after 23...Be4 .

**23...O-O 24.Rac1 Qb6 25.b4 Be4**

Eliminating White's f5 ideas.

**26.Rce1 Rd4 27.Re3 Rc8**

Threat: ...Rc2.

**28.Bb1 Qc6 29.Rg3 g6 30.h3**

30.Bxd3?? Bxd3 31.Rxd3 Qc4! 32.Rd1 Rxd3 33.Qxd3 Qxd3 34.Rxd3 Rc1+ forces mate next move.

**30...Qc3!**

Unhinging White's blockade of d2.

**31.Qe3 d2! 32.Qf2**

EXERCISE (combination alert): The steady haemorrhaging continues. How did Black convert his overwhelming advantage?

32.Bxe4 Qxe3 33.Rxe3 Rc1 is a game ender.

**32...Qxg3!**

ANSWER: Queen sacrifice/pawn promotion.

"I didn't lie to you, since I was acting, and an actress doesn't have to mean what she recites in her lines," reasons Black's queen, to her sister.

**33.Qxg3 Rc1!**

Promotion is the hub of Black's intent. Black regains a new queen, remaining with an overwhelming material advantage.

SUMMARY: Our secret to overcoming the Milner-Barry Gambit is to accept the first pawn, and then decline the second. The gambit reminds me of the 1960's hippy, sticking a daisy down the barrel of a soldier's gun: it sends a message, yet no physical harm is inflicted. Chess is more complicated than a set of fixed rules which tells us which openings are allowed and which are forbidden.

The Milner-Barry isn't such a great line for White, yet it contains practical chances. Only in the movies are evil doers punished and the virtuous rewarded. Be careful. In real life, club players tend to forget Black's defensive ideas, after which White may indeed generate a powerful attack, which can take on the aspect of a surly hibernating bear, who is awakened by loudmouthed passing hikers. So study this one well as Black.

**0-1**

### Van Wely,L. - Topalov,V. 33: Dortmund, 2005

**1.d4 e6 2.e4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bd7**

Black replaces ...Qb6 with ...Bd7.

NOTE: The two lines don't necessarily transpose. If White plays 6 Bd3, only then do we transpose back into the Milner-Barry.

**6.a3**

On 6.Be2 Black usually responds with 6...Nge7 7.O-O

(7.dxc5 is well met with 7...Ng6 when Black gets White's valuable e5-pawn)

7...Ng6 8.g3 (intending h4 and h5) 8...Be7 9.h4 cxd4 10.cxd4 O-O 11.h5 Nh8 (Black's knight is only temporarily disconnected and will emerge on f7) 12.h6 g6 13.Nc3 f6 with a satisfactory position for Black. White's h6-pawn may turn into a liability in an ending.

Instead, after 6.Bd3 we transpose to the normal Milner-Barry lines with 6...cxd4 7.cxd4 Qb6 8.O-O Nxd4 .

**6...f6**

TIP: Black immediately challenges e5, profiting from the fact that his queen isn't on b6, which tends to be a poor square in these a3 lines.

**7.Bd3**

After 7.b4 fxe5 8.b5 Nxd4!? 9.cxd4 exd4 Black gets three central pawns for the piece, a fair deal.

**7...Qc7**

Continuing to apply pressure on e5.

**8.Bf4**

White can also gambit the e-pawn.

8.O-O I suggest declining with 8...O-O-O .

**8...O-O-O**

I would be more inclined to play 8...c4 9.Bc2 O-O-O .

**9.O-O**

Alternatively, 9.b4 c4 10.Bc2 h6 11.h4 fxe5 , and if 12.Bxe5 Nxe5 13.Nxe5 Bd6! 14.Nf7 Nf6 15.Nxh8 Rxh8 when ...e5 is coming and it feels to me like Black gets full compensation for the exchange.

**9...c4 10.Bc2 Qb6**

Attacking b2 and provoking White into his next move.

**11.b3!?**

As we saw earlier in the chapter, this move opens lines for White's potential attack, at the cost of creating holes and pawn weaknesses.

**11...cxb3 12.Bxb3 g5 13.Be3!**

13.Bg3?! g4 14.Nfd2 fxe5 15.dxe5 h5 favours Black.

**13...g4 14.Ne1 Na5**

Gaining a tempo, while seizing control over c4.

**15.Bc2 f5 16.Nd3 Kb8 17.a4**

Preventing ...Bb5, while leaving open Na3 possibilities.

**17...Rc8**

White can attack along the open b-file, while Black works over White's backward c3-pawn and c4-square.

**18.Qe2 Qa6 19.Qe1 b6**

Covering against Nc5.

**20.Na3 Bxa3!?**

Topalov hands over his valuable dark-squared bishop to secure control over c4.

**21.Rxa3 Ne7 22.Nb4 Qb7 23.Bd3**

Threat: Ba6.

**23...Nc4 24.Bxc4 dxc4**

Clearing d5 for Black's pieces.

**25.a5**

This move prevents ...a5 and allows White's knight to roost on b4.

**25...b5**

Of course it is in Black's best interest to keep queenside lines closed.

**26.a6 Qa8! 27.Qe2**

White drifts.

After 27.Bh6! Nd5 28.Qb1 Nxb4 29.Qxb4 , and if 29...Qd5?!

(29...Qe4! looks approximately even)

30.Qd6+! Qxd6 31.exd6 White stands a bit better in the ending.

**27...Nd5 28.Nxd5 Qxd5**

NOTE: Opposite-coloured bishops favour the attacking side, which in this case is Black.

White is in deep trouble. An object can be elusive in two ways:

1. It is hidden and far away.

2. It is so commonplace, that we miss it because it is too close.

This is a case of the latter. White may look fine, but upon closer examination, the presence of opposite-coloured bishops is devastating for him. Although it doesn't appear so, Black's king is quite safe. Black's winning plan:

1. White's light squares are slowly eroded with ...h5, ...h4 and ...h3.

2. Also, White's bishop is hemmed in by its own dark-squared pawns, while Black is free to apply pressure down the h1-a8 diagonal with a queen and bishop battery.

3. Black can play ...Ka8 and then transfer rooks to b6 and c6, and pick off White's a6 straggler, which allows a black rook decisive infiltration.

**29.f4?**

WARNING: Avoid fixing your pawns on the same colour as your remaining bishop, since this weakens the opposite colour.

This move, which is at odds with White's interests, makes his bishop even worse, chronically weakens his light squares, and his king's very existence becomes problematic.

White had to try 29.f3! Rcg8 30.fxg4 Rxg4 31.Qf3 (the runty little kid breathes relief when she discovers the school bully is home sick today) 31...Re4! (it's in Black's best interest to keep queens on the board) 32.Qg3 Bc6 33.Bf4 and he is better off than what he got in the game.

**29...h5**

Intending to push all the way to h3.

**30.Rb1 h4 31.Kf1 Bc6 32.Bg1 Ka8 33.Rb4 Rb8 34.Ra2 Rb6**

Reminding White that his a-pawn requires baby-sitting and may fall if an ending should arise.

**35.Ke1 h3**

The weak light squares prove to be a valuable commodity for Black.

**36.g3 Rc8 37.Be3 Bd7!**

Worrying White about ...Rcc6 and ...Rxa6.

**38.Ra5 Qh1+ 39.Kd2 Bc6 40.Qf2**

White's responses are constrained by his dependency. When we lose a long, miserable game, we feel like the serf who is born, lives life in fruitless toil, grows old and dies, without anyone noticing or caring.

**40...Bd5!**

Eliminating all d5 desperadoes from White.

**41.Qg1**

41.Rbxb5?? fatally exposes White's king after 41...Rcb8! 42.Rxb6 Rxb6 .

**41...Qe4 42.Kc1 Rcc6!**

Black's intent slowly swims into view.

**43.Qf2 Rxa6**

White's infrastructure begins to crumble.

**44.Raxb5 Ra1+ 45.Rb1 Rxb1+ 46.Rxb1 Ra6!**

Rook infiltration is a key component of the mating plan.

**47.Qd2 Qh1+**

47...Qh1+ 48.Qd1 Qxh2 is curtains for White.

SUMMARY: The ...Nc6/...Bd7 development scheme is an attempt to reach a favourable version for Black, when White goes for the a3 and b4 plan.

**0-1**

### Baker,B. - Lakdawala,C. 34: San Diego (rapid), 2011

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5!? c5 4.c3 Bd7**

This is the Wade Variation.

NOTE: Black's intent is to dump his bad bishop by playing ...Qb6 and ...Bb5.

**5.Nf3 Qb6 6.Na3**

This move prevents Black's intended ...Bb5 plan.

He can also allow it: 6.Be2 Bb5 7.c4!? .

NOTE: White's common strategy is to meet ...Bb5 with the disruptive c4.

After 7...Bxc4 8.Bxc4 dxc4 9.d5 exd5 10.Qxd5 Ne7 11.Qxc4 Qb4+ 12.Qxb4 cxb4 the ending is close to even. White's superior majority is offset by the slightly weak central light squares, due to the e5-pawn.

6.a3 Bb5 7.c4!? (the same idea as in variation 'a') 7...Bxc4 8.Bxc4 dxc4 9.d5 exd5 10.Qxd5 Ne7 11.Qxc4 Qa6! .

TIP: In this line we can offer a gambit of our c-pawn.

If White goes for it with 12.Qxc5!? we get full light-square compensation with 12...Nd7 13.Qe3 Ng6 14.Nc3 Nc5 15.Qe2 Nd3+ 16.Kf1 O-O-O . Black's development lead and aggressive piece placement offer full compensation for the pawn.

**6...cxd4 7.cxd4 Ne7**

Also possible is 7...Nc6 8.Nc2 Nb4 9.Ne3 Bb5 when Black achieves his aim of swapping light-squared bishops.

WARNING: I would avoid the tempting 7...Bxa3 8.bxa3 .

I actually prefer White here, for the following reasons:

1. Black just gave away his dark squares.

2. Black is unable to swap away his bad bishop via b5, since it is fatally pinned with Rb1.

3. Black may have damaged White's queenside structure, but in return, White got an open b-file to apply pressure with a rook on b1.

**8.Be2 Nbc6 9.O-O Rc8 10.b3?**

White, preparing Bb2, is obsessed with preventing ...Bb5 and allows his a3-knight to get frozen out of play.

Correct was 10.Nc2! Ng6 11.h4 Be7 12.h5 Nh4 13.Nxh4 Bxh4 . It isn't clear yet if White's space represents a plus or a burden of future overextension.

**10...Nb4!**

Now we see a leakage in White's intent. This move disenfranchises the a3-knight, placing it in limbo, by preventing the intended Nc2.

**11.Bb2 Ng6**

This is the only way to unravel the kingside.

**12.g3!**

Preparing h4 and h5, while cutting off ...Nf4 ideas.

**12...Be7 13.h4 O-O!**

TIP: Don't be afraid of getting your knight chased to h8!

It emerges soon enough on f7, after an ...f6 break.

**14.h5 Nh8**

One of my old handles on an online server in the 1990's was 'Lakofdawalapment', and now you know why. Black's last move may contain the look of unintentionality to it, yet it's quite deliberate. IM Jeremy Silman once wrote an article on chess.com, about players' favourite moves, featuring this game. My favourite is any knight retreat. Only a qualified psychologist can tell me why. Outwardly, the knight placement on h8 may elicit a snicker or two, but when examined deeper we see that the idea contains hidden virtues, since the knight pops out again on f7, where it's well placed to cover key squares like e5 and g5.

**15.Qd2 f6**

Dual purpose:

1. Black challenges White's central dominance.

2. Black makes room for ...Nf7.

**16.Rfe1?!**

Believe it or not, this natural move weakens f2, which becomes noticeable in the moves ahead.

On 16.exf6 I intended 16...gxf6! .

TIP: Don't hesitate to play such a move, which seizes control over e5 and prepares a future ...e5. This outweighs the slight weakening of Black's king, who is for now, amply defended.

Instead, 16.h6! looks like White's best. I intended 16...gxh6! 17.exf6 (17.Qxh6 Nf7) 17...Rxf6 18.Ne5 Be8 19.Ng4 Rg6 20.Nxh6+?! Kg7 21.Ng4 Nf7 with a truly messy position typical of the French.

**16...Nf7**

Hi, I'm back again.

**17.Bd1**

White is forced into contortions to get his stranded a3-knight back into play.

**17...fxe5 18.Nxe5**

18.dxe5? is strongly met with 18...Ng5! (the knight is immune due to the hidden counterattack on f2) 19.Re3 Ne4 , and if 20.Qe2 Bc5 White is crushed.

**18...Nxe5 19.Rxe5!**

When we set up a trap, we become Pinocchio, except that our nose remains the same size in our chess lie.

My opponent avoids 19.dxe5?? Rxf2! 20.Qxf2 Bc5 , winning White's queen.

**19...Bd6 20.Re3**

EXERCISE (planning): For now, Black's position is stranded somewhere between efficiency and dormancy. If you find Black's correct plan (which is hidden from view, like Batman, Robin the boy wonder, and Alfred, working out a plan to nab the Penguin in the Bat Cave), you seize the initiative.

ANSWER: Clear c5 to target f2, the square which is Black's ground of hope.

**20...e5!**

TIP: Initiative is the opiate of the masses. In situations where you take on the backward e6-pawn, be on a constant lookout for opportunities to break out with ...e5.

**21.dxe5**

After 21.h6 e4 (intending ...Nd3) 22.hxg7 Rf7 23.Be2 Rxg7 (threat: ...Bf4) 24.Rc3?? is not possible due to 24...Rxc3 25.Qxc3 Bxg3! 26.fxg3 Qd6 and White is curiously helpless to protect g3. If 27.Kf2 , the interference shot 27...Nd3+! wins.

**21...Bc5 22.Rf3 Bf5?**

It's no good if you get things right, but the wrong way around! This is a move order mix up. Dang. Your humble scribe got a bit confused here. I obviously suffer from some kind of chromosomal deficiency where I can't seem to convert winning positions, without at least a few stumbles. This mistake, which bleaches Black's attack of its own significance, invalidates my previous argument. I chose a plan so elaborate, that even Liberace would condemn it as overly ornate.

Correct was the simple path, which I inexplicably saw and rejected, 22...Rxf3! 23.Bxf3 Rf8 24.Qe2 Bf5! . Now is the correct timing, preventing Nc2, while menacing both ...Nd3 and ...Bd3, and if 25.e6 Qd6 (threat: ...Qxg3+) 26.Be5 Qxe6 27.Bf4 Nd3 28.Qxe6+ Bxe6 29.Nb5 Nxf4 30.gxf4 Rxf4 with a winning position for Black.

**23.h6?**

This is the house of cards path.

White may yet save himself with 23.Rc1! Be4 24.Rxc5! (a good investment, which depletes Black of dark-square power in the attack) 24...Qxc5 25.Rc3 Qb6 26.Rxc8 Rxc8 27.Bg4 Rc7 28.Nc4! when Black must return the exchange and is unable to play 28...dxc4?? 29.Qd8+ Kf7 and the simplest way to win is 30.e6+ .

**23...Be4**

Now White is unable to defend f2.

**24.Qg5**

This utilitarian decision saves White from mate, but only leads to a lost ending.

**24...Qxh6 25.Qxh6 gxh6 26.Rf6 Nd3**

We sense a winding down of White's vitality, since he is unable to defend a3, b2 and f2 all at once.

**27.Bg4 Rce8 28.Rc1**

Desperation.

**28...Nxc1 29.Bxc1 Rxe5 30.Rxf8+ Bxf8**

SUMMARY: The idea behind the Wade Variation is to dump the bad bishop for White's good model, with ...Bd7, ...Qb6, and ...Bb5.

**0-1**

## 6: The Exchange Variation

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 exd5**

Something boring this way comes. White's exchange on d5 - where little is said, yet much is implied - isn't exactly laden with ominous overtones, but equalizing isn't the issue for us. This chapter we cover the Exchange French, a line sometimes used by lower-rated players to blackmail us into a draw.

In the position, our dynamism appears in danger of dissolution as White's exchange of pawns on d5 inflicts a deflationary effect upon our future fun. We are not going to respond like grieving players. Have you ever had an obnoxious friend call you two hours after your normal bedtime, and then coyly ask: "I hope I didn't call too late. Did I wake you up?" Well, in this chapter we take on the role of this obnoxious friend, and force our opponents out of bed and into action.

My goal this chapter is to show you that the Exchange line isn't synonymous with an arid game, and no charm exists for our opponent to ward off our mischief-making magic. Our secret? Asymmetry. If our opponent castles kingside, we go the opposite way with our king; if our opponent sets up knights on f3 and d2, we develop ours on the asymmetrical c6- and e7-squares, respectively. With this strategy we force a fight on our peace-loving opponents.

### Iyer,V. - Lakdawala,C. 35: San Diego (rapid), 2014

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5**

My student, Professor Joel Sneed (If Joel's name sounds familiar, it's because he co-authored three Everyman books with GM Boris Gulko) wrote me in an email just yesterday: "Why does everyone play the Exchange French against me? It is a curse. It makes it unplayable."

I will let you in on a little secret: we French players loath the Exchange line. Most books only give the Exchange a cursory glance, dismissing the line as harmless, which is true if you are fine with a draw as Black. If you are playing for a win, however, it becomes a giant pain for Black. My goal in this chapter is to ease your fears that the Exchange French will lead to an automatic draw.

**3...exd5 4.Bd3 Nc6**

TIP: Our secret to beating down the Exchange French is twofold:

1. Create an imbalance in the piece placement - even a slight one, and then be on a constant lookout for further imbalances, i.e. play two knights versus the opponent's bishop-pair, but in a blocked position; or castle on opposite wings, as seen in this game.

2. Our job is to understand the structure deeper than our opponent. If you are a consistent French player with many years of experience, your understanding of the subtleties of the structure will be greater than your lower-rated opponent, who is just playing the Exchange as a one-time weapon to try and draw.

**5.c3**

Alternatives: 5.Ne2 Nb4 6.Bb5+ c6 7.Ba4 when White's bishop is slightly out of play, and our knight can re-route with ...Na6, ...Nc7 and a future ...Ne6.

5.Nf3 allows the annoying pin 5...Bg4 .

**5...Bd6 6.Nf3**

TIP: If White continues in grovel mode with 6.Ne2 intending Bf4, then reply with the aggressive 6...Qf6! denying White's intent.

**6...Bg4 7.h3?!**

WARNING: Don't push pawns on the wing you intend to castle.

The h3 push, a self-thwarting exercise, provides future attacking and sacrificial targets to the opponent. White, itching not to 'waste' an opportunity to gain a tempo, plays a self-harming move. The decision is similar to eyeing your two-week-old sushi in the fridge, and thinking: "It smells a little funny, but it would be a waste of good money to throw it out." Such decisions are a quick way of getting us connected to a stomach pump in a hospital bed.

He should probably continue with a line like 7.O-O Nge7 8.Re1 Qd7 9.Nbd2 O-O-O 10.b4 Ng6 11.Qa4 Kb8 12.b5 Nce7 13.Ne5 Bxe5 (remember to create imbalances!) 14.dxe5 d4 . Nobody can say the game is drawish anymore, B.Petersson-G.Meier, Vaxjo 2015.

**7...Bh5 8.Nbd2 Nge7**

NOTE: Black develops the knight asymmetrically to e7, not f6. This way the path is cleared for a potential future pawn storm with ...f6 and ...g5.

**9.O-O f6**

We begin to see the rudimentary outline of Black's agenda, which is to seize control over e5, while considering ...g5 in the future.

**10.Re1 Qd7 11.b3?!**

WARNING: Don't dilly dally in situations of a potential opposite wing attack, where every tempo counts.

White's move is suspension, rather than motion. In the absence of visibility, a prudent 'I-will-wait-for-a-plan-to-make-itself-evident' strategy can be our worst choice. I'm not sure what motivated my student Venkat into playing this move. Either he intended Bb2 and a future c4, or he was hoping that I would be lulled into castling long (which I intended all along), and only then would he play b4.

NOTE: When White begins the 'attack' early with 11.b4 our opponent forgets that we haven't signed a contract to castle long. Don't presuppose that we must attack in every situation.

Instead, be flexible and go short with 11...O-O! , after which White's b4 thrust may later prove to be a weakening of the queenside light squares for no compensation.

White's most accurate continuation is 11.Qc2! O-O-O and now that Black commits to queenside castling, war has begun with 12.b4 Rde8! (clearing d8 for the knight in case of b5, and leaving the h8-rook free to attack White's king) 13.a4 g5 and it's anybody's game.

**11...O-O-O**

Carpe diem - seize the day!

TIP: Against the Exchange French, if you can, castle on opposite wings and declare war on your peace-loving opponent!

**12.a4 g5**

The Beatles would agree: "You say you want a revolution?"

**13.b4**

NOTE: To play b3 and then b4 is a tail-chasing waste of time, which happens to be a favourite pastime of my dogs.

Not only did White lose a move by taking two moves to achieve b4, but White also suffers for tossing in his earlier h3, since it's easy for Black to pry open White's king.

**13...Ng6**

Eyeing both h4- and f4-squares.

**14.Qc2 Nce7 15.Ba3 Nf4 16.Bb5!**

He wants to provoke ...c6 to later open queenside lines with b5.

**16...c6 17.Bf1**

This bishop isn't quite a slave, and certainly doesn't qualify as a citizen. Maybe he falls somewhere in between, in serf-like fashion.

**17...g4 18.hxg4?!**

WARNING: Don't help your opponent open lines against your king.

There is no reason to agree to this grim-lipped concession. White shouldn't open the g-file without a fight, although even after 18.Nh2 Rhg8

(18...gxh3?! is met with the clogging 19.g3)

19.b5 Bxa3 20.Rxa3 g3! 21.fxg3 Rxg3 22.Kh1 Black's attack still looks faster than White's.

**18...Qxg4**

Black attackers veer right in unison, in imitation of a squadron of synchronized fighter jets at an air show.

**19.b5**

EXERCISE (combination alert): White's game teeters on the brink of dissolution. Black has access to two promising continuations for his attack. You only need to find one of them.

ANSWER: Annihilation of defensive barrier. The knight sacrifice throws the white king's plight into unflattering relief.

**19...Nxg2!**

ANSWER no.2: Less spectacular, but also winning is 19...Bg6! , and if 20.Qb2 Bd3! (removal of the guard, in this case the only defender of g2) 21.bxc6 Nxc6 22.Rab1 b6 23.Bxd6 Bxf1 24.Nh4 Rxd6 25.Nxf1 Qxh4 . Black is up a piece and attacking.

**20.Bxd6**

White's last move is similar to the doctor who tells the nurse: "The patient may be in excruciating pain, but don't waste good morphine on him, since he will die in a few hours anyway."

The text loses without a fight, but there was no saving White. For instance, 20.Bxg2 Rhg8 21.Nh4 (when material up and under attack, our extra loot is a vital commodity, to be doled out in a stingy manner as a bribe which offers: "Take this money in exchange for my life"; we experience a terrible sense of being double crossed when our dishonest opponent takes our bribe and our life!) 21...Qxh4 22.Bxd6 Rxd6 23.Re3

(23.Rxe7?? Qh3 is curtains for White)

23...f5! (threat: ...Rdg6) 24.Rg3 Rdg6 25.bxc6 bxc6 26.Nf1 f4 27.Rxg6 Rxg6 with overwhelming threats to White's king, who is only kept alive via intravenous feeding tubes.

**20...Nxe1+ 21.Bg3 Nxc2**

SUMMARY: Dreary uniformity is not necessarily our fate when our opponent plays the Exchange French. The secret to beating the non-confrontational Exchange line is to create imbalances, such as castling on opposite sides of the board, or trading bishop for a knight. However White sets up his or her opening development, you should do the opposite!

**0-1**

### Kishnevsky,D. - Lakdawala,C. 36: San Diego (rapid), 2009

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5**

I lamented in my notes in 2009: "Not again! This is the third straight opponent who played the Exchange against my French!"

**3...exd5 4.Bd3 Nc6 5.c3 Bd6 6.Nf3 Nge7**

NOTE: This is a minor alteration from last game, where Black avoids an early ...Bg4, and instead hopes to challenge White's good bishop with ...Bf5.

**7.Qc2**

An alert reaction which prevents ...Bf5.

**7...Bg4 8.Nbd2**

Covering f3 against potential structural damage.

**8...Qd7**

Once again renewing the fight for f5, while preparing to castle long.

**9.O-O O-O-O**

Black's most dynamic option.

9...Bf5 10.Re1 Bxd3 11.Qxd3 O-O is dull and even, which is not the kind of game I was looking for.

**10.b4**

White begins his pawn storm immediately.

**10...Bf5!**

TIP: Trade away White's light-squared bishop in the Exchange French, which he soon finds to be an intolerable deprivation when attempting to cover his weakened light squares.

**11.a4**

11.b5 Bxd3 12.Qxd3 Na5 13.Nb3 Nc4 14.a4 Qf5! allows Black either a pleasant ending, or forces White's queen to back off.

**11...Bxd3 12.Qxd3 Qf5!**

TIP: Just because the players castle on opposite sides of the board, doesn't guarantee wild mutual attacks.

In this case Black's strategy is to eliminate both White's good bishop, and also his queen, after which his queenside pawn pushes may later become a liability in the ending.

**13.Qxf5+**

Note much choice since 13.Qe2?! loses time and gets White's pieces tangled after 13...Qc2! 14.Ra3 Nf5 . Black will gain another tempo with a coming ...Re8.

**13...Nxf5 14.Nb3 h5**

Securing the position of the f5-knight by preventing g4.

**15.Bd2 f6 16.a5?!**

WARNING: Principle: avoid fixing pawns on the same colour as your remaining bishop.

Now White's defensive issues begin to grow intractable. When we violate principle, we reach the moment in the Sci-fi movie where the aliens, disguised as humans, betray themselves and begin to arouse suspicion, since everything they do and say appears unnatural.

**16...a6**

This freezes the white queenside pawns on dark squares, while weakening White's light squares.

**17.Nc5?!**

The concept of a team falls apart if one of its members considers him or herself a rugged individualist. It's important not to engage in a plan which is outside the capability of our position. This move further weakens White's structure.

**17...Bxc5 18.bxc5**

Chronically weakening his a-pawn.

If 18.dxc5 Black undermines b4 with 18...d4! 19.Rfd1 Rhe8 20.Kf1 dxc3 21.Bxc3 Nfe7! (intending ...Nd5 and ...Ndxb4) 22.Be1 Rxd1 23.Rxd1 Rd8 24.Rb1 Rd3 . White is tied down and weak on the light squares, and must also deal with a bad bishop.

**18...Na7**

Eyeing the b5 hole.

**19.Ne1 c6?!**

A superficial move. I wanted to stabilize the queenside, but with hindsight, the move is inaccurate, since:

1. The glitch leads to disruption of services, depriving Black of a ...Nc6 option later on.

2. Black deprives himself of an option to infiltrate the queenside with his king, via d7, c6 and b5.

The correct plan is to leave c6 open and post knights on the light squares b5 and c6.

**20.Nd3 g5**

Cutting off both Nf4 and Bf4, while gaining kingside territory.

**21.Rfe1 Rde8**

The correct rook, since Black's d8-rook had nothing to do on the closed d-file.

**22.Kf1 Nb5**

Meaning White must babysit c3.

**23.Rxe8+ Rxe8 24.Re1?!**

Now White's path to a draw is about as secure as an unfertilized egg, en route to becoming a future chicken.

WARNING: We can't rely on generalities in a position of absolutes, and trading isn't always synonymous with drawing.

Now White experiences difficulty in protecting his a5-pawn and his difficulties pass the level of a trial and move seamlessly into an inquisition.

**24...Rxe1+ 25.Nxe1?**

EXERCISE (planning): How did Black force the win of a pawn?

Correct was 25.Bxe1 Na3 26.Nb2! (preventing ...Nc4, followed by ...Nxa5; White must fashion his defence brick by brick, like a determined Inuit, desperate to construct an igloo before the coming snow storm) 26...Nc4 27.Nxc4 dxc4 28.h3 Ne7 29.g4 hxg4 30.hxg4 Nd5 with a good knight versus bad bishop ending. Even here White's survival is far from an unimpeachable truth. His only chance to draw would be to try for a fortress by sealing the position against Black's king entry.

**25...Na3!**

ANSWER: Transfer the knight to c4, after which a5 falls.

**26.Ke2 Nc4 27.Nd3 Nxa5 28.f4?**

Made with the live-free-or-die motivation, but allowing more corrosion on the light squares.

WARNING: This move, demonstrative of White's frustration, is yet another violation of the principle stating that we shouldn't allow our pawns to get fixed on the same colour as our remaining bishop.

**28...g4 29.h3**

White is desperate for some kind of kingside counterplay.

**29...gxh3 30.gxh3 Nc4**

The black knights dominate the light squares, while White must now continually watch out for the promotion attempts of Black's passed a-pawn.

**31.Nf2**

EXERCISE (planning): How did Black force a pawn-up king and pawn ending?

ANSWER: Simplification.

**31...Ng3+! 32.Kd3 Nxd2 33.Kxd2 Ne4+! 34.Nxe4**

After 34.Ke3 Nxf2 35.Kxf2 b6! 36.cxb6 Kb7 37.Ke3 Kxb6 38.Kd2 Kb5 39.Kd3 a5 40.h4 a4 41.f5 a3 42.Kc2 Kc4 Black wins easily.

**34...dxe4**

The king and pawn ending is lost and my opponent resigned here.

34...dxe4 35.f5 a5 36.Ke3 a4 37.Kxe4 (White won his pawn back, but his king is too late in halting Black's a-pawn) 37...a3 38.Kd3 and 'almost' is the most discouraging qualifier in the English language. White loses by one tempo after 38...a2 .

SUMMARY: Sometimes we castle long with the following strategy:

1. Swap away White's good bishop with ...Bf5.

2. Trade away queens with ...Qf5.

3. Play to overextend White on the queenside if our opponent has played b4 and a4.

**0-1**

### Kasparov,G. - Lakdawala,C. 37: Internet (blitz), 1998

Normally a five minute blitz game isn't considered worthy of annotation in a chess book. The exception is when one of the players is the world champion. Each generation produces a Nietzchean 'ubermensch', or metahuman, who plays with god-like abilities. In this game the ubermensch is playing little me!

**1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5**

The lines of the French vary in degree of difficulty from Plato's writings, to the script of Abbot and Costello Meet The Mummy. Of course Kasparov was just goofing around and let me off the hook theoretically in the opening.

Had he played his normal 3.Nc3 then the odds were heavy that your writer would have been clobbered a lot worse than what happened in the game.

**3...exd5 4.Nf3**

NOTE: This is one of the few Exchange French lines where White actually plays dynamically for the win.

The idea behind this move order is twofold:

1. White wants to play an isolani position with c4 next.

2. White allows Black to commit to ...Bd6, and only then plays c4, with an isolani position. This way Black lacks both ...Bb4+ and ...Be7 options later on.

Thereby White hopes to reach a slightly favourable version of an isolani position, as can arise too after 4.c4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Be7 .

NOTE: In this version Black's bishop is better posted on e7, rather than the awkward d6-square in my game with Kasparov.

An example: 6.Bd3 dxc4 (now is the correct time to capture c4, once White's bishop wastes a move) 7.Bxc4 O-O 8.Nge2!? (White wants to play it in Tarrasch French fashion, but with colours reversed) 8...Nbd7 9.O-O Nb6 10.Bb3 c6 11.Re1 Bf5 12.Ng3 Bg6 13.f4!? (White risks overextension with this move) 13...Bd6! 14.Qf3

(14.f5? is well met with 14...Bxg3)

14...Qd7 15.Rf1 Bf5! 16.Nxf5 Qxf5 17.h3 h5 (g4 must be prevented) 18.Qf2 Rad8 19.Bc2 Qd7 20.Ne4?! Nxe4 21.Bxe4 Rfe8 22.Bc2 Bc7 23.Rd1 Nd5 24.Qf3 Nf6 25.Kh1 Qd5 , R.Bruno-C.Lakdawala, San Diego (rapid) 2006. Black has a strategically won game for the following reasons:

1. White's position is riddled with weak squares, like e4, e3 and e2 and d5.

2. White nurses a weak d4 isolani, which may later fall.

3. White lags in development on the queenside.

**4...Bd6**

I think a more accurate move order is 4...Nf6! , after which White gets a reduced scale copy of what he got in the game: 5.c4 and now Black can either play 5...Be7, or 5...Bb4+, both of which are superior to what I got in the game's continuation.

(The reason I avoid 4...Nf6 is the line 5.Bd3 Bd6 6.O-O O-O 7.Bg5 Nbd7 8.Nbd2 c6 9.c3 Re8 10.Re1 when the position is a bit of a snoozer, Wei Yi-Y.Vovk, Baku 2015.)

Instead, 4...Bg4!? is aggressive, but possibly slightly inaccurate, since White extracts an edge after 5.h3 Bh5 6.Qe2+! Qe7

(I have grave doubts about Black's compensation for the pawn after 6...Be7?! 7.Qb5+ Nd7 8.Be2 Ngf6 9.Qxb7 ; I just don't think Black's development lead is enough for the pawn)

7.Be3! Nc6 8.Nc3 O-O-O 9.g4 Bg6 10.O-O-O f6 11.a3 Qd7 12.Nd2 f5 13.Nb3 Nf6 14.f3 . Black's position is acceptable, but still slightly inferior, since White controls e4 and has a queenside build-up, G.Kasparov-N.Short, Tilburg 1991.

**5.c4**

This variation falls between boundaries. Just because it's an Exchange French, doesn't mean that White took a vow of non-violence. So Kasparov goes for a potential isolani position, which comes with long-term risks, like a potential bad ending, if White isn't able to extract anything from his middlegame initiative. Of course Kasparov avoiding the risky/dynamic option would be the same as a mayor of a city, who in a desire to pursue austerity measures, fires all the city's paramedics, replacing them with Uber drivers, equipped with band aids and aspirin.

**5...Nf6**

WARNING: In isolani positions, avoid moves like 5...dxc4?! which allow White a free development jump to c4. Only capture on c4 after White plays either Be2 or Bd3. This way Black gains a tempo.

**6.Nc3 O-O 7.cxd5**

Kasparov wants to play an isolani position.

TIP: Don't fear being down a pawn in such situations. White isn't able to hang on to d5 forever.

NOTE: Playing the isolani position isn't obligatory here. White can also go for a tempo-gain with 7.c5!? Be7 8.Bd3 b6 .

TIP: When White plays c5, chip away at it as early as possible with ...b6. 9.cxb6

(9.b4? a5 overextends White since a3 isn't possible due to ...axb4, when White's a-pawn is pinned)

9...axb6 10.h3 c5 with an acceptable position for Black, E.Sutovsky-B.Socko, Rijeka 2010.

**7...Re8+ 8.Be2 Nbd7**

The idea is to transfer to b6 and then later play either knight takes d5.

**9.O-O**

More enterprising is 9.Bg5 h6 10.Bh4 a6 11.O-O b5 12.a3 Bb7 13.Re1 and now Black can risk 13...g5!? 14.Bg3 Nxd5 . Black regained the lost pawn with a sharp position. Of course once a committal move like ...g5 has been played, Black must take precautions for the safety of his king, which looks adequately defended for now.

**9...h6**

Preventing Bg5.

**10.Bc4!?**

Kasparov makes it as difficult as possible for Black to regain the lost pawn. Yet his move is exceedingly risky, since it allows Black ...Nb6 and ...Bg4, after which it isn't so easy for White to break the f3 pin.

**10...Nb6**

Another plan is 10...a6 intending ...b5, ...Bb7, ...Nb6 and ...Nbxd5. The trouble is White can deny Black his intent by tossing in 11.a4! with an edge.

**11.Bb3 Bg4 12.h3 Bh5 13.Be3?!**

This move loses the initiative.

White should go for 13.g4 Bg6 14.Ne5! . White offers the pawn back. If Black accepts with 14...Bxe5!? 15.dxe5 Rxe5 16.f4 Re7 17.f5 Bh7 18.Bf4 Rd7 19.d6! cxd6 20.Qd4 White gets more than enough compensation for the pawn, with the bishop pair, aggressive piece placement and a dangerous kingside space advantage.

**13...Qd7!**

Intending ...Qf5.

**14.a4!?**

Risky, since it creates a hole on b4. I'm convinced that players like Kasparov are propelled by an unconscious belief that they are immune from mortality - at least on the chess board.

**14...a5 15.Rc1 Qf5**

NOTE: If your opponent has the isolani, then a queen swap is generally in your favour.

This forces an ending, after which White's happiness is destined to be a fleeting thing, while his future misery is of enduring quality.

Maybe I should have proceeded in a calmer manner with 15...Re7 16.Re1 Rae8 when White has no constructive plan and is caught in a nasty pin on f3.

**16.Bc2**

White gets demolished if he gets greedy with 16.g4?? .

WARNING: Avoid impulsive pawn pushes which weaken your king's safety.

Here 16...Bxg4 17.hxg4 Qxg4+ 18.Kh1 Qh3+ 19.Kg1 Ng4 20.Qe2 Bh2+ 21.Kh1 Bf4+ 22.Kg1 Rxe3! 23.fxe3 Bxe3+ wins.

**16...Bxf3 17.Bxf5 Bxd1 18.Rfxd1 Nfxd5**

Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder, and to this beholder, White's game appears rather homely:

1. Black regained the lost pawn.

2. Black stuck White with an isolani, which isn't conducive for an ending. In fact White's structure rests in a state of perpetual dilapidation.

3. White now probably regretted his rash a4 move earlier, since it created a hole on b4.

4. White's bishop pair is anything but an advantage here, since Black's knights more than hold their own.

Conclusion: Black stands slightly better in the ending and White's game requires lengthy strategic convalescence. Still, it's a derailment, rather than a full-fledged train wreck.

**19.Bd2 c6 20.Nxd5 Nxd5 21.Kf1 Re7**

Worth a thought was 21...Bf4 which follows the principle: when your opponent has the bishop pair, eliminate one of the bishops if possible.

**22.g3**

Halting ...Bf4.

**22...Bb4**

So I look for the swap from the other angle.

**23.Bxb4?!**

We, the ordinary, love it when a great player veers off course, since then he is yanked down to our day-to-day human level. This is an unnecessary concession, after which White stands clearly worse.

Correct was 23.Bc3 into a holding pattern.

**23...Nxb4 24.Bg4 Rd8 25.Rc5!**

Provoking queenside pawn weaknesses in Black's camp on c6.

**25...b6 26.Rc3 Rd6**

Covering c6.

**27.Re3 Kf8 28.Rd2**

EXERCISE (critical decision): Is 28...c5 a good move for Black?

28.Rde1 is met with 28...Nd5 .

**28...c5?**

ANSWER: It's weak! White's d2-rook isn't pinned at all.

A herbivore is unwise to pick a fight with a moody T-Rex.

**29.Rxe7! Kxe7 30.Re2+!**

Oops, I forgot he could play this.

**30...Kf6 31.dxc5 bxc5**

Crap. I unnecessarily allowed him to damage my queenside structure, while allowing him to eliminate his d4 isolani. I threw away my advantage, but Black should still be just fine here. To fix such structural defects, Black's pieces must cooperate and call to mind monkeys who carefully groom each other for lice removal.

**32.Re3 c4?!**

Making matters worse.

After 32...Rd3 33.Ke2 Rxe3+ 34.Kxe3 Ke5 Black draws easily.

**33.Be2 Nd3?!**

Black has better chances to hold the game with 33...Rd4 34.Rc3 Nd3 35.b3! Ke5 36.bxc4 Nc5 37.Rc2 Kd6 38.Rb2 Nxa4 39.Rb5 Nc3 40.c5+ Kc6 41.Rxa5 Nxe2 42.Kxe2 Rd7 . White experiences great difficulties in making progress in the rook and pawn ending.

**34.b3!**

Undermining my knight and winning a pawn. White's counterplay, once dead, is jolted to life in Frankenstein fashion.

**34...Ne5 35.bxc4 Rc6 36.Re4**

TIP: Principle: place your rook behind your passed pawn. Correct was 36.Rc3! .

**36...Rc5 37.Rd4 Ke7 38.h4 Nd7!**

The b6-square is the ideal posting for the knight, where it simultaneously attacks c4 and a4.

**39.Re4+**

The greedy comp likes 39.Bd1! intending to hang on to both queenside pawns with Bb3.

**39...Kd6 40.Rf4**

Not best.

40.Bd1! was to be preferred.

**40...f6 41.h5**

Fixing g7 as a potential target.

**41...Nb6 42.Rg4 Rg5 43.Rd4+ Kc5 44.Rd8 Nxa4**

At last, I regained the lost pawn and now own a passed a-pawn. I misassessed here, thinking that Black had a won game, due to this passer. Kasparov's next move shows this just isn't the case.

**45.f4! Rxg3**

45...Rf5?? self-traps the rook after 46.Bg4 .

**46.Rd5+! Kb4**

Simpler was 46...Kb6 47.Rb5+ Ka6 48.Kf2 Rh3 49.Bg4! Rd3 50.Bc8+ Ka7 51.Rxa5+ . The game should end in a draw.

**47.Rb5+!**

Incrementally, it felt like I was losing ground every few moves. There goes my precious a-pawn!

**47...Kc3 48.Kf2 Rh3 49.Rxa5 Rh2+ 50.Kf3 Nb6 51.c5 Nd5 52.c6**

The c-pawn gets awfully dangerous, yet Black has resources to hold the draw.

**52...Kd4 53.Ra7**

Going after g7, while menacing c7.

**53...Rh3+! 54.Kf2 Rc3**

Going after g7, while menacing c7.

**55.Rxg7 Rxc6 56.Bf3 Rc2+ 57.Kg3 Rc3**

57...Ne3 is more accurate.

**58.Rd7**

EXERCISE (critical decision): Black can cover d5 with 58...Rc5, or he can side step the pin with 58...Kc4, relying on tactics. Only one of the moves works. Which one would you play?

**58...Rc5??**

Black's king sighs sadly, upon the realization that the c5-rook, his son and heir, is a complete dunce. To a beaten down man like your writer, who has taken more blows to the head than I can count on the chess board, what is one more? There are three times in a person's life when our life flashes before our eyes:

1. Just before we die.

2. Just before we get married.

3. Just before we lose a chess game.

My last move was an example of number three on the list.

ANSWER: 58...Kc4! holds the draw, after which Black's king feels the happy release of the third-grader who hears the final bell, allowing escape from maths class. After 59.Rh7

(59.Rxd5 is met with the undermining trick 59...Rxf3+! 60.Kxf3 Kxd5 when White must play carefully to draw; the only move to hold the game is 61.Ke3! f5 62.Kd3 which is a drawn king and pawn ending)

59...Ne3! 60.Kf2 Nf5 61.Be4 Ne3 62.Rc7+ Kd4 63.Rxc3 Nd1+ 64.Kf3 Nxc3 65.Bg6 Nd5 66.Kg4 Ne3+ , White's king is denied entry to f5 and the game is drawn.

**59.Kg4 Ke3**

The disgraced king submits his resignation letter.

If I play normally and allow the natural permutation with 59...Kc4 60.Rxd5 Rxd5 61.Bxd5+ Kxd5 62.Kf5 , White wins the king and pawn ending.

**60.Rxd5**

Of course I should resign here, but this was a blitz game and Kasparov didn't have time on his clock. I offered a draw, but world champions don't tend to accept when a piece up against a schmuck, so he played and went on to flag!

**60...Rc8 61.Bd1 Rf8 62.Kf5 Rf7 63.Rd6 Kf2 64.Rxf6 Rd7 65.Rxh6 Rxd1 66.Rg6 Rd5+**

Here I 'won' on time, in a completely hopeless position! 'Winning' under such circumstances is similar to the person awarded an 'honorary' PhD. I'm not fooling anyone calling myself Dr. Lakdawala. Everyone knows I didn't earn a real PhD!

SUMMARY: 4 Nf3 is usually a precursor to an isolani position when White plays c4 next.

**0-1**

## 7: Other Lines

We finish the book with the loose ends chapter of various lesser lines, the most important of which may be the King's Indian Attack. In fact, pretty much every line covered is slightly offbeat, so this means our opponent isn't eager to challenge us theoretically, and in fact may consider any memorization battle offensive.

**1.--**<fen value="r1bqk2r/pp2nppp/2nbp3/2pp4/4P3/3P1NP1/PPPN1PBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 1"/><fend/>

The idealist dreams, while the realist consolidates. With the KIA, White - who is firmly in the latter philosophical category - pretty much concedes his or her first move advantage. As compensation they force a structure into which they are undoubtedly familiar and comfortable. Our suggested counter set-up may yet yank our opponent into unfamiliar territory. For now the clogged centre resembles the freeway during 5.00 p.m. rush hour, and it becomes very difficult to foresee how the structure gels 10 moves from now. We remain flexible, keeping the centre fluid, while slowly preparing queenside expansion, with fully even chances.

The other lines covered in the chapter are not a threat to us in a theoretical sense. Our only danger is that we neglect to study them (a study trap many chess players fall for is to work obsessively on our main lines, like the Winawer, Tarrasch and Advance, while neglecting the less scary lines), so keep these minor lines in your study rotation, and you won't get ambushed.

### Hamdouchi,H. - Edouard,R. 38: French Championship, Pau, 2012

**1.e4 e6 2.d3**

The King's Indian Attack versus the French. This is a closed system where White can either play for a slow direct attack on the kingside, or try for a central/queenside build up with plans like c3, a3, b4 and d4.

**2...d5**

2...c5 is also played, but can transpose to the immediate ...d5 lines.

**3.Nd2**

NOTE: Like in the Tarrasch line, White plays the knight to d2. In this case the idea is to avoid a swap of queens.

**3...c5 4.Ngf3 Bd6**

The normal move order is 4...Nc6 5.g3 Bd6 .

Ultra-sharp is the line 4...Nf6 5.g3 Nc6 6.Bg2 Be7 7.O-O O-O 8.Re1 b5 9.e5 Nd7 10.Nf1 a5 11.h4 b4 . It becomes a battle of Black's queenside attack versus White's kingside build-up.

**5.g3**

WARNING: 5.e5?! just gives Black a target to work over after 5...Bc7 6.g3 Nc6 7.Nb3 b6 . White is tied down to defence of e5 and already stands slightly worse.

**5...Ne7 6.Bg2 Nbc6**

This is the set-up for Black I advocate in my book 'Anti-Sicilians: Move by Move'.

**7.O-O O-O 8.Re1**

Instead, 8.Nh4 Bd7 9.f4 f6 10.c3 Be8 11.f5 dxe4 12.Nxe4 was seen in V.Saulespurens-C.Lakdawala, Los Angeles 1998. Black equalizes with 12...Nxf5 13.Nxf5 exf5 14.Rxf5 Ne5 .

**8...Bc7 9.c3 b6 10.a3**

TIP: With a3 and c3, White keeps options open for both a b4 and a d4 pawn break.

**10...a5 11.a4**

This slows Black's queenside expansion and creates a hole on b5 for Black to worry about.

**11...Ba6**

TIP: Black can apply pressure to d3 by transferring a bishop to a6.

**12.exd5**

White goes for central play.

**12...Nxd5**

12...exd5 is an option, which keeps White's knight out of c4. White can continue with 13.Nb1!? intending to transfer to a3, where it watches over the b5 hole.

**13.Nc4**

Black is unable to boot the knight with ...b5, due to White's earlier a4.

**13...Qd7**

WARNING: Avoid moves like 13...Bxc4?! 14.dxc4 Nde7 15.Qe2 . Black gets a healthy 4 vs 3 kingside majority, while handing White a crippled 4 vs 3 queenside model.

Yet, Black's decision to chop on c4 is incorrect, since his loss of light squares, coupled with the fact that his remaining bishop is bad, means that White got the better of the bargain.

**14.Qe2 h6 15.Bd2 Rad8 16.Rad1**

White's backward d3-pawn is adequately defended and the game looks approximately balanced.

**16...Nce7**

Uncovering an attack on a4, which forces White to weaken on his next move.

**17.b3 Nc6 18.Nfe5**

White initiates central swaps.

**18...Nxe5 19.Nxe5 Bxe5**

Black rids himself of his bad bishop.

**20.Qxe5 Ne7**

Once again Black applies pressure to d3.

**21.d4!? c4!**

Undermining the queenside pawns.

21...cxd4?! is met with 22.Be3! with an edge for White.

**22.Bf1**

Pinning the c4-pawn.

**22...Qc6 23.Bg2 Qd7 24.Bf1 Rc8**

Black refuses the repetition draw offer.

**25.Rb1 Nd5 26.Re4**

Getting Black nervous about a swing of the rook to g4 or h4.

**26...Rfe8 27.Rg4!?**

White itches to take vigorous countermeasures. His move is made with the urgency of the thought: 'If not now, then when?'. White's rook may be out of play on the kingside.

**27...f5! 28.Rh4 Ne7**

Threatening to fork the white queen and rook with ...Ng6 next.

**29.Rh3?!**

WARNING: Rooks are clumsy pieces in a middlegame, so lift them with great caution.

When we deliberately violate principle, we do so looking over our shoulders, expecting a punishing blow from the vengeful chess goddess. White sees his potential attack as half full, rather than half empty, when in reality the rook is out of play on h3 and this path is unlikely to be fruitful. This becomes a question of competing truths: is White's rook an attacking piece? Or is it simply out of play? My belief is in the latter version.

White should offer another repetition draw with 29.Qe3 Nd5

(Black can also play for a win with 29...Ng6! 30.Rh5 b5!? 31.axb5 Bxb5 32.b4 a4 when I still prefer Black's game slightly)

30.Qe5 Ne7 .

**29...Ng6 30.Qe2 e5!**

Black seizes the initiative with this central counter.

**31.Qh5 Qe6?!**

More accurate is 31...Re6! , and if 32.Qxf5? exd4 favours Black.

**32.Be3?!**

White should just go for it with 32.Bxh6! gxh6 33.Qxh6 exd4 34.cxd4 Re7 35.d5 when his chances don't look worse.

**32...Bb7 33.bxc4**

Now White ends up with an inferior game.

He should still try 33.Bxh6! .

**33...exd4 34.Bxd4**

34.cxd4?? is met with 34...Qe4 (threatening both mate and the b1-rook) 35.d5 f4! (this way g6 is covered) 36.gxf4 Qxb1 37.Rg3 Ne7 38.Qxh6 Nf5 . Black defends and wins.

**34...Ne5**

Threatening a big check on f3.

**35.Bg2?**

White had to try 35.Bxe5 .

**35...Bxg2 36.Kxg2 Ng4!**

The knight roams about in the form of free agent. Now ...g6 is a big worry for White.

**37.Rb2 Rxc4?!**

Black missed 37...g6! 38.Qh4 Rxc4 , and if 39.Rxb6 Qd5+ Black forces mate in three moves.

**38.Rh4!**

Nothing unites a nation as efficiently as the existential threat of annihilation.

**38...g6 39.Rxg4**

White extricates his queen, at the cost of the exchange.

**39...fxg4**

To rid ourselves of an authoritarian enemy piece generates in us a malicious bliss similar to seeing your pushy boss slip on a banana peel.

**40.Qb5**

EXERCISE (combination alert): What is Black's best continuation?

ANSWER: Deflection/mating net.

**40...Rxa4!**

What joy when we are given the gift of serendipitous geometry. When we find a hidden combination, we become the biblical prophet who alone is privileged to hear a secret message from God.

**41.Rb1**

The rook is immune.

If 41.Qxa4?? Qd5+ 42.f3 (or 42.Kf1 Qh1#) 42...Qxf3+ 43.Kg1 Re1# .

**41...Qe4+ 42.Kg1 Rb4!**

A sweet interference shot which removes White's rook and weakens his king's defences.

**43.Rxb4 axb4 44.Qxb4 Qe1+ 45.Kg2 Qe6**

Threatening a mate in three moves, starting with either ...Qc6+ or ...Qd5+.

**46.Qb5**

Covering the mating threat.

**46...Ra8**

Threat: ...Qe4+.

**47.h3**

White's game continues to deplete as steadily as sand trickling down the hourglass. Black's only fear in such a position is that he gets careless and allows White's lone queen and bishop to deliver either perpetual check or mate on Black's exposed king.

47.Qxb6?? Qe4+ forces mate.

**47...gxh3+ 48.Kh2 Ra1 49.Qd3 Qc6**

Threatening mate on h1 and g2. This is the part of the movie when the killer enters the house and the soundtrack begins to play sinisterly dissonant music.

**50.f3**

White's king is slowly eroded of cover.

**50...Qe6 51.Bf2 Ra8 52.g4 Rf8 53.Kxh3 h5! 54.Bg3 Kh7**

Silence can be an ominous sign in a war setting, since it can mean the enemy is building for a final assault. Black's move anticipates a future need of king shelter from White's perpetual check attempts.

**55.c4 Rc8**

White must either lose his c-pawn or swap queens, both of which lose.

**56.Qd5**

The arthritic dowager limps to d5, begging for a swap.

56.Bh2 Rxc4 is equally hopeless for White.

**56...Qxd5**

Why not? Black's passed b-pawn ensures the victory.

**57.cxd5 b5 58.d6 Rd8**

SUMMARY: The system involving ...Nc6, ...Bd6, ...Nge7 and ...O-O is a reliable equalizer versus the King's Indian Attack.

**0-1**

### Morozevich,A. - Lputian,S. 39: Wijk aan Zee, 2000

**1.e4 e6 2.d3**

NOTE: When White plays 2.Qe2 on the second move, the idea is to discourage ...d5 since after exd5, Black must recapture with the queen.

We can try and cross White with 2...e5 , where we get a double king's pawn opening, but with White having the less-than-useless Qe2, clogging development. For example, 3.Nf3 Nc6 4.g3 Bc5 5.Bg2 d6 6.c3 a6 7.h3 Nge7 8.O-O O-O 9.d3 f5 10.b4 Ba7 11.Be3 Bxe3 12.Qxe3 f4 when Black's kingside attacking chances are easily equivalent to White's queenside space, D.Aldama-C.Lakdawala, San Diego (rapid) 2016.

**2...d5 3.Qe2!?**

NOTE: This move order prevents our plan from last game, which is the set-up: ...c5, ...Nc6, ...Bd6 and ...Nge7.

**3...dxe4**

This move dodges the main line which runs 3...Nf6 4.Nf3 Be7 5.g3 c5 6.Bg2 Nc6 7.O-O O-O 8.e5 Nd7 with sharp mutual wing attacks.

**4.dxe4 b6**

Black intends to harass White's queen with ...Ba6 next.

Also good enough for equality is 4...e5 which is the route I would take: 5.Nf3 Nd7 6.Nbd2 Bc5 7.Nc4 Qe7 when White's queen is misplaced on e2.

**5.Nd2!?**

A new move at the time;

and more enterprising than 5.Nf3 Ba6 6.Qd2 Qxd2+ 7.Bxd2 , M.Buckley-S.Lalic, British League 2000. Black equalizes after 7...Bxf1 8.Kxf1 Nf6 9.Nc3 Nc6 .

**5...Ba6 6.Nc4!?**

This is Morozevich's idea. He self-pins to avoid a bishop swap.

**6...Nf6 7.Nf3 Nc6 8.c3 Be7**

8...Na5 is met with 9.Qc2! Bxc4 10.Bxc4 Nxc4 11.Qa4+ Nd7 12.Qxc4 . White looks a shade better since he leads in development and Black created a hole on c6.

**9.e5 Nd7!?**

There is no reason to go passive like this.

I would be more inclined to play the knight to d5 with 9...Nd5! 10.Qe4 Qd7 11.Be2

(after 11.Qg4 the threat to g7 can be ignored with 11...Bb7! 12.Qxg7 O-O-O with a dangerous development lead for the pawn)

11...Bb7 12.O-O O-O-O with a sharp position.

**10.Qe4**

White breaks the pin, attacking c6 and intending to swing the queen to g4.

**10...Bb7 11.Qg4 g6**

WARNING: Beware of pins.

11...O-O?? walks into 12.Bh6 g6 13.O-O-O! (stronger than capturing on f8) 13...Re8 14.Qf4 Qc8 15.Ne3 when Black's pieces are horribly tangled and White has a winning attack.

However, I would consider forgoing castling in favour of a zero weakening plan with 11...Kf8!? .

**12.Bh6 b5!?**

This move swaps the b5-pawn for White's e5-pawn.

12...Bf8 was a safer alternative.

**13.Ne3 Ndxe5 14.Nxe5 Nxe5 15.Bxb5+ c6 16.Qe4**

16.Qg3! was more accurate.

**16...Qc7 17.Be2 f5! 18.Qa4?**

After this move White loses the material. I have a friend who is a smoker, who claims that tobacco isn't harmful, since his father smoked two packs a day and made it to age 80. Morozevich's similarly cavalier attitude toward material loss is the same, where it has cost him, and won him countless games.

Correct was 18.Qf4! (the general must eventually be subsumed by detail) 18...O-O-O 19.Nc4 Nd3+ 20.Bxd3 Qxf4 21.Bxf4 Rxd3 22.O-O g5 23.Be5 Rhd8 and chances look balanced in the ending.

**18...Nf7!**

Suddenly, White's bishop is in deep trouble.

**19.Bf4**

White offers a piece to muck it up.

After 19.Bg7 Rg8 20.Bd4 Kf8!

(20...e5? is met with the tricky 21.Nd5!)

21.Nc4 c5 22.Be3 Bxg2 23.Rg1 Qxh2 24.O-O-O Kg7 White doesn't get full compensation for his two missing pawns.

**19...e5 20.Bg3 f4**

The bishop is trapped, but this isn't the end of the story. Morozevich still gets fishing chances for the piece after his next move. Still, White's position has the look and feel of a San Diego State University student (I live a mile from the college, so I speak from experience) brought low by a Saturday night of excess.

**21.Nd5!**

Exploiting the pin of the c6-pawn.

**21...Qd6 22.O-O-O!?**

White's investment threatens to grow prohibitively expensive, but if: 22.Nxe7? is met with 22...fxg3! when White's knight is trapped.

22.Nxf4 exf4 23.Bxf4 Qe6 24.Be3 O-O and White lacks full compensation for the piece.

**22...fxg3 23.Nf4**

A discovered attack on Black's queen.

**23...Qf6 24.Nd5**

Threatening Black's queen, as well as a fork on c7.

**24...Qd6 25.Nf4 Qb8!?**

My lifelong motto: if at first you don't succeed, then just give up immediately. Your chicken-hearted writer would be inclined to take the repetition draw here. Lputian bravely goes for the full point.

**26.Ne6 Ng5!**

Challenging White's knight.

**27.Bc4**

After 27.Nxg5 Bxg5+ 28.Kb1 gxh2 29.Bg4 Kf8 30.Rxh2 Bc8 White still gets some practical chances, but objectively Black is winning.

**27...Nxe6 28.Bxe6 gxh2?!**

The wrong pawn.

28...gxf2! 29.Rhf1 Rf8 30.Bd7+ Kf7 31.Rxf2+ Kg7 sees White's attack shudder to a halt and Black consolidates.

**29.Rxh2 Bd6?**

It's easy to drift in such positions. There are certain fixed laws in the universe, like the one where all restaurants have ketchup, salt, sugar and cream canisters at every table - except at the one we are sitting at. In terrible complications, under pressure and with our clocks running low, it's a near certainty that we will pick an inferior line.

Black should play 29...Qc7! , after which White's counterplay grows tepid: 30.Rd7 Qxd7 31.Bxd7+ Kxd7 . Normally when we lose our queen, we become the resentful serf who just had his new bride deflowered on his wedding night by his liege lord. In this case though, Black's chances are clearly superior, with two bishops and a rook for White's queen.

**30.f4!**

TIP: Open lines and create confrontation when leading in development.

**30...e4?**

Now he can no longer hold off the deluge of threats.

Black had to try 30...Qc7 .

**31.g3 Qc7 32.Qd4! Rf8**

The question is: should White regain his lost piece with 33 Qxd6, or should he spurn the material and keep attacking with 33 Qxe4?

Instead, 32...Ke7 is met with 33.Bc4 Rae8 34.Rhd2 Rhf8 35.Qg7+ Kd8 36.Rxd6+ winning.

**33.Qxe4!**

In this instance, dynamic factors outweigh material considerations. White has a winning attack by chopping the e4-pawn.

**33...Qe7?**

EXERCISE (combination alert): Ignorance may or may not be bliss. Cows live their lives in bovine contentment, because they are unable to grasp the concept of a slaughterhouse. Black just blundered in an already lost position. How should White continue his attack?

He had to try 33...Rf6 .

**34.Rxh7!!**

ANSWER: Deflection/removal of the guard/annihilation of defensive barrier.

Moro doles out further largesse. This is the preliminary tremor in the earthquake to come.

**34...Qxh7 35.Rxd6**

Black's king is helplessly caught in the middle.

**35...Qc7**

EXERCISE (combination alert): White to play and force mate in three moves!

35...Rf6 is met with 36.Bf7+! Kxf7 37.Rd7+ Kg8 38.Rxh7 Kxh7 39.Qe7+ Kh6 40.Qxf6 and White wins.

**36.Bf7+!**

ANSWER: Attraction.

A lie is simply the truth, wearing a disguise.

**36...Kxf7 37.Qxg6+**

37.Qxg6+ Ke7 38.Qe6# is mate!

SUMMARY: When White plays an early Qe2 in the King's Indian Attack, we essentially turn the game into a double king's pawn game with ...dxe4 and ...e5, when White gets the useless 'extra' move Qe2, clogging his kingside development.

**1-0**

### Gunnarsson,J. - Riazantsev,A. 40: European Cup, Rogaska Slatina, 2011

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3**

The Two Knights line. White holds back his d-pawn and simply develops.

**3...Nf6**

I think this simple move is Black's best.

He can agree to White's provocation with 3...d4 4.Ne2 c5 5.c3

(also played is the line 5.Ng3 Nc6 6.Bb5 Bd7 7.O-O Bd6 8.d3 Nge7 with level chances)

5...Nc6 6.cxd4 cxd4 7.Qa4 , but suddenly Black's extended d-pawn is in danger. After 7...Bc5 8.b4! (deflection) 8...Bxb4 9.Nexd4 , White looks slightly better, having traded a wing pawn for Black's more valuable d-pawn.

**4.e5 Nfd7 5.d4 c5 6.dxc5**

NOTE: In this line White is unable to back up the d4-pawn with c3. This means Black inflicts real damage to White's centre by swapping away a c-pawn for White's more valuable d-pawn. White relies on piece play to compensate.

**6...Nc6**

Pressuring e5.

**7.Bf4 Nxc5**

NOTE: Black can capture c5 with either knight or bishop. The difference? The bishop capture helps speed Black's development, while ...Nxc5 discourages White from posting his light-squared bishop on d3, its best square.

After 7...Bxc5 8.Bd3 f6 9.exf6 Nxf6 10.O-O O-O 11.Ne5 Bd7 12.Qe2 Nxe5 13.Bxe5 Qb6 Black's central control, open f-file and active pieces compensate for White's blockade of the e5-square.

However, I favour the tricky waiting move 7...Be7 , and if 8.Be2 a6 9.O-O g5!? .

WARNING: Now White must be on the lookout for sudden ...g5, ...g4 undermining ideas.

For example, 10.Bg3?! (correct was 10.Be3) 10...h5! (threat: ...h4 winning a piece) 11.h3 g4 12.hxg4 hxg4 13.Nd4 Bxc5 14.Nxc6 bxc6 15.Bxg4 Qg5 . Black has a strong attack with two open files on the kingside, B.Baker-C.Lakdawala, San Diego (rapid) 2013.

**8.Be2**

This is a passive square, which also interferes with White's control over e5.

The problem with 8.Bb5 is that Black usually induces White to hand over the bishop after 8...Be7 9.O-O a6 10.Bxc6+ bxc6 . White picked up the bishop pair, strengthened his centre and pried open the b-file for his rook.

**8...Be7 9.a3 O-O 10.O-O f5**

This move gives White a choice: he can take on f6, en passant, handing Black control over the centre, or he can ignore it and allow Black an annoying ...Ne4 post.

**11.exf6!**

The correct decision.

11.Re1?! allows 11...Ne4! with a clear advantage for Black.

**11...Bxf6**

Black more than equalized. Not only does he enjoy greater central control, but he also controls the crucial e5-square.

**12.Bg3 a6**

A precaution against Bb5.

**13.Re1 Ne4! 14.Bd3!?**

A tricky idea, which Black sees through.

White can also risk 14.Nxe4!? dxe4 15.Nd2 Bxb2 16.Rb1 Bc3 17.Nxe4 Bxe1 18.Qxe1 e5 when I don't believe in White's full compensation.

**14...Nxg3!**

Black picks off the bishop pair and eliminates a key defender of e5;

avoiding the tempting but flawed line 14...Nxc3?! 15.bxc3 Bxc3? 16.Bxh7+! Kh8

(16...Kxh7? is met with 17.Qd3+ Kg8 18.Qxc3 when White favourably regains the piece)

17.Nh4! when White has a dangerous attack.

**15.hxg3**

TIP: In general, structurally you are better off capturing towards the centre, rather than away from it.

**15...g6**

Making room for his bishop on g7.

**16.Bf1 Bg7 17.Qd2 b5 18.Rad1 Qf6 19.Qd3 Ra7!**

Planning to swing the rook over to f7.

**20.Rd2 Raf7**

The question arises for White: amplify or diminish?

**21.a4?!**

WARNING: Avoid creating confrontation from an inferior position.

White was better off remaining passive, stiff-upper-lipping it with 21.Nd1 , although I do admit that White's pieces have the look of strolling around aimlessly, like dandies in a Jane Austen novel.

**21...b4 22.Nd1 Qd8**

Intending ...Qa5.

**23.Qe3 Qa5 24.b3**

This move is inaccurate, since it allows Black an easy ...e5.

White should play 24.Qb3 .

**24...e5**

Black dominates, with a strong centre, the bishop pair, open f-file and the more active pieces.

**25.Ng5?**

A move made with the philosophy: when our dream is small and cautious, then it isn't much of a dream. Self-confidence without our position's ability to correspond to reality doesn't equal a self-fulfilling prophecy. White's plan falls under the unfortunate labour-in-vain category. This unjustified lunge is the bar patron who has had one too many, blaming the ground for swaying when he walks home at closing time. White's last move allows a nasty pin. After this mistake White's position reaches a saturation point, where it collapses if it gets even an iota worse.

**25...Bh6!**

Threat: ...d4! disconnecting White's queen from the g5-knight.

**26.f4**

In such situations we are assailed with hurtful regrets of our own past folly.

Also hopeless for White is the line 26.Rxd5 Qxd5 27.Bc4 Bxg5 28.Qxg5 Qd4 and White is down too much material.

**26...exf4 27.gxf4 Rxf4 28.Nf3 Kg7**

This move avoids Rxd5 and Bc4 pin tricks from White.

**29.Qd3 Rxf3**

Less flashy, but stronger was the line 29...Qc5+ 30.Nf2 R4f5 31.Rdd1 Bf4 with total domination.

**30.gxf3 Bxd2**

Black immediately regains the lost exchange.

**31.Qxd2 Rxf3**

Another pawn falls. Money keeps pouring into Black's position, the way a billionaire heir may not have even the vaguest notion of how his bank balance and holdings continue to rise each day.

**32.Bg2 Qc5+ 33.Nf2 Rf8 34.Re3**

34.Bxd5?? walks into a deadly pin after 34...Rd8 35.Rd1 Be6 .

**34...Bf5 35.Bxd5**

EXERCISE (critical decision): Black has two tempting moves. He can pin the bishop with 35...Rd8, or he can activate his knight with 35...Nd4, which simultaneously threatens ...Qxd5 and ...Nxc2. One line is stronger than the other. Which one would you play?

ANSWER:

**35...Nd4!**

Bringing in another attacker is the most efficient route to Black's goal.

35...Rd8 is met with the tricky 36.c4! bxc3 37.Qxc3+ Qxc3 38.Rxc3 Rxd5 39.Rxc6 when White can still fight on.

**36.Bc4**

After 36.Be4 Bxe4 37.Nxe4 Nf3+ 38.Kg2 Qh5 39.Qd7+ Rf7 40.Qd6 Qg4+ 41.Qg3 Nh4+ 42.Kh2 Qh5 Black's queen approaches White's king with the air of a person just about to disclose dreadful news. Black has a winning attack.

**36...Nxc2 37.Rf3 a5 38.Qg5 Qe5**

White is down two pawns with the more exposed king.

SUMMARY: White is lucky to equalize in the Two Knights line. The pre-existing worry: Black can strip White of his or her central pawns with the ...c5 and ...f6 breaks.

**0-1**

### Papaioannou,I. - Gurevich,M. 41: Corinth, 1998

**1.e4 e6 2.b3**

This is an attempt to take Black out of the main lines, and basically weird it up.

**2...d5 3.Bb2**

With this move White disowns all ambiguity, offering to gambit his e-pawn for a development lead.

**3...dxe4**

A move made with the philosophy: a full belly is worth the sin of theft. White's challenge demands a degree of abrasiveness from our side and I suggest we accept the offer.

NOTE: If you don't care for the position Black got in the game's continuation, then Black can also obtain a perfectly acceptable French-like position with 3...Nf6 .

This is the sanitized version, which looks more like a real French position: for example, 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Bb5 Qc7 with approximately even play.

**4.Nc3 f5!?**

Gurevich intends to hang on to his booty, for now, avoiding 4...Nf6 5.Qe2 Be7 6.Nxe4 O-O 7.Nf3 Nc6 8.O-O-O a5 . Black's chances don't appear worse in the coming opposite wings attacks.

**5.f3**

White can gambit the pawn another way with 5.d3 exd3 6.Bxd3 Nf6 7.Qe2 Bb4 8.O-O-O Qe7 9.Nf3 Nc6 10.Rhe1 O-O . Maybe I speak with a French player's bias, but it doesn't feel like full compensation for the pawn here, since Black developed harmoniously.

**5...Bd6!**

TIP: Return the extra pawn to threaten ...Qh4+ and seize the initiative.

Our message to White: power, when exercised too haughtily, generates resentment, and therefore a potential backlash. This is a direct attempt to punish the punisher. Black strikes back without preamble, with his bishop taking a threatening step in the white king's direction. I can never remember if it's the kettle who calls the pot black, or if the pot is the one making the accusation. In any case, this is an attempt for Black to turn the tables, suddenly switching from defence to attack.

Gurevich's move is stronger than allowing White his intent with 5...exf3 6.Nxf3 Nf6 7.Bc4 Bd6 8.Qe2 Qe7 9.Ng5! when White gets more than enough compensation for the pawn due to his development lead and pressure on e6.

**6.fxe4?!**

Entering the wrong line is similar to dialling a wrong number. Ego has an insidious way of shaping its analytical conclusions to its own stylistic needs. White agrees to enter head-spinning complications, which favour Black.

He was better off going into damage control mode with 6.Nxe4!? (this move serves as a foghorn warning to sailors, of treacherous underwater rocks ahead) 6...fxe4 7.Bxg7 Qh4+ 8.Ke2 Ne7 9.Bxh8 Ng6! and White must hand over a second piece for the rook, since ...Nf4+ is a devastating threat. White must play 10.Qe1! Qxe1+ 11.Rxe1 Nxh8 12.fxe4 Nf7 . I still prefer Black's chances in the ending, with two pieces for a rook and two pawns.

**6...Qh4+ 7.g3**

Not much choice since if 7.Ke2?? fxe4 . White is busted with his king stuck in the centre.

**7...Bxg3+!**

Black utilizes a small pin tactic to win the exchange.

**8.hxg3 Qxh1 9.Nb5!**

White's best chance. He threatens both Nxc7+ and also Bxg7.

**9...Nf6 10.Nxc7+ Kd8**

Our brains are in danger of becoming addled with information overload. In such scary complex positions I tend to resemble Richard Nixon in his debate with John F Kennedy, where I sweat and if I wore make up, it would run under the glare of the television lights.

The comp points out that more accurate was the counterintuitive 10...Kd7! 11.Nxa8 Qxg1 12.Qf3 Nxe4 13.O-O-O Qxg3 with advantage to Black in the coming ending.

**11.Nxa8 Qxg1 12.Qf3 Nxe4 13.Bxg7?**

White can't afford this loss of time.

Chances are confusingly even after 13.O-O-O! .

**13...Rg8 14.Be5 Nc6**

Black keeps developing with tempo gains.

**15.Bc7+ Ke7 16.O-O-O Qc5!**

Threatening both ...Nd4, and also ...Qa3+, followed by ...Nb4. White's pieces are tangled in the corner, while Black's develop harmoniously.

**17.Qh1 Qa3+ 18.Kb1**

EXERCISE (critical decision): Should Black play for mate with 18. ..Nb4, which allows White 19 Qxh7+, or should Black take time for a defensive move with 18...Nf6 - ? One line leads to a draw, while the other should win. What is your pick?

**18...Nb4?**

This lunge is hasty and should allow White perpetual check.

ANSWER: Correct was the calm 18...Nf6! , securing h7. After 19.c3 (White must prevent ...Nb4) 19...Bd7 (White's problem: his a8-knight is trapped) 20.Bf4 Rxa8 21.Bg5 Rf8 White lacks full compensation for the piece.

**19.Qxh7+ Kf8 20.Qh6+ Kf7 21.Qh7+ Rg7 22.Qh5+ Rg6**

22...Kg8 23.Qe8+ Kh7 24.Qh5+ is perpetual check.

**23.Qh7+ Rg7 24.Qh5+ Ke7 25.Bd8+??**

Wild guesses are not the best method of establishing the truth. I think it was the press of despair which burdened White's last move.

EXERCISE (critical decision): Pitfalls lay in wait for both sides. Should Black accept the bishop, or should he side step with 25...Kd6 - ? Checkmate, like death, is a place from which there is no return. Black forces mate if you make the correct decision, while Black's own king gets mated if he plays the wrong move. Find the pocket of light within the confusion.

White can hold the game with 25.Qh4+! . If you have one remaining bullet in the chamber, your best bet is to wait for a clean shot: 25...Nf6 26.Bd8+! Ke8 27.Bb5+ Bd7 28.Bxd7+ Kxd7 29.Qd4+ Ke8 30.Qa1! Kxd8 31.Qxf6+ Re7 32.Qd4+ Rd7 33.Qf6+ Kc8 34.Qf8+ Rd8 35.Qc5+ Kd7 36.Qd4+ with perpetual check.

**25...Kd6!**

ANSWER: Black should decline the gift.

This move brings to mind Steve Job's final words: "Oh wow, oh wow, oh wow!". Now White's position, the armless man who continues to threaten his rival with his stumps, festers in absence and need. White runs out of checks and is mated after 25...Kd6! 26.Be7+ Rxe7 27.Bd3 Qxa2+ 28.Kc1 Qa1# . "Good night; sleep tight; don't let the bedbugs bite," recites the queen, as she orders her brother to the dungeon.

However, 25...Kxd8?? turns a win into a loss after 26.Qh8+ Ke7 27.Qxg7+ Kd6

(27...Ke8 28.Bb5+ Nc6 29.Rh1!)

28.Qc7+ Kd5 29.Bc4+ Kd4 30.c3+ Nxc3+ 31.dxc3+ Kxc3 32.Qe5# .

SUMMARY: When White plays 2 b3 we first accept the offer and then return it a few moves later with 5...Bd6!, seizing the initiative.

**0-1**

### Kasparov,G. - Ponomariov,R. 42: Linares, 2002

**1.e4 e6**

Strangely, the position which arose in the game can also come about from the 2 c3 Sicilian, after the move order: 1...c5 2.c3 d5 3.exd5 Qxd5 4.d4 e6 5.Nf3 Nf6 6.Na3 Qd8 7.Nc4 Nc6 8.Nce5 Nxe5 9.Nxe5 when we transpose to the game continuation, but with one extra move played for each side.

**2.d4 d5 3.Nc3**

NOTE: The Rubinstein is also reached after the Tarrasch French move order 3.Nd2 dxe4 4.Nxe4 which transposes to the game.

**3...dxe4**

The Rubinstein French is kind of a default setting, to be played against both 3 Nc3 and 3 Nd2.

TIP: The line is considered one of Black's most safe solid (and unenterprising!) choices in the French, and may be a good pick when facing a very aggressive opponent.

NOTE: The Rubinstein line is similar to the Burn variation of the Classical (which we covered earlier in the book) after 3...Nf6 4.Bg5 dxe4 5.Nxe4 Nbd7 .

The difference is that in the Burn, White commits to an early Bg5, which helps Black, since it becomes easier to swap pieces from a cramped position.

**4.Nxe4 Nd7**

Black's idea is to challenge White's well placed e4-knight with ...Ngf6.

Instead, 4...Bd7 is the Fort Knox line, which runs 5.Nf3 Bc6 6.Bd3 Nd7 7.O-O Ngf6 . Black's idea is to hand over the bishop pair with either ...Bxe4, or ...Bxf3, followed by ...c6, with an ultra-solid yet slightly inferior Caro-Kann-like position.

**5.Nf3 Ngf6 6.Nxf6+**

Kasparov doesn't want to lose time with his knight and so exchanges it off.

6.Bg5 transposes to a line of the Burn variation of the Classical French.

**6...Nxf6 7.c3**

White bolsters his centre in anticipation of Black's coming ...c5.

Instead, after 7.Bd3 c5 8.dxc5 Bxc5 9.Qe2 O-O 10.Bg5 h6 11.Bh4 Qa5+! (this move discourages White from castling long) 12.c3 Nd5 (strategic threat: ...Nf4) 13.Qd2 Be7 14.Bxe7 Nxe7 15.O-O Bd7 Black connects the rooks and achieves a reasonable outcome from the opening.

**7...c5**

WARNING: Be careful about your timing of ...c5, which fights back against White's extra central space, but at the same time violates the principles: avoid opening the game or creating confrontation when lagging in development.

In this case, though, 7...c5 is still Black's main move and is considered a necessary evil. Black can also delay ...c5 for much later with the line 7...Be7 8.Bd3 O-O 9.Qe2 b6 10.Bg5 Bb7 11.O-O-O . White enjoys an edge in the opposite wings attacks, since Black has yet to engineer a successful ...c5, and suffers from a slight lack of central space.

**8.Ne5!**

NOTE: Principles aren't written by a deity, never to be violated. This move is in direct violation of the edict: don't move the same piece twice in the opening. In this case, it is a well-applied exception.

This was a shocking new move at the time of this game and one which is now considered White's best shot at an edge. Black must now watch out for sudden Bb5+ and Qa4 ideas.

8.Be3 is also played here: 8...Qc7 9.Ne5! this is merely a delayed version of Kasparov's idea;

(instead, after 9.Bd3 Bd6 10.O-O O-O Black can be satisfied with his or her position)

9...a6! (once again, measures must be taken against the coming Bb5+) 10.Qa4+ Nd7 11.O-O-O cxd4 12.Nxd7 Bxd7 13.Qxd4 Bc6 14.Be2 Rd8 15.Qg4 h5 16.Qg5 Rd5 17.Rxd5 Bxd5 18.Rd1 g6 19.Qf6 Rh7 , when Black's game remains solid yet passive, R.Kasimdzhanov-G.Meier, Spanish Team Championship 2010.

**8...Nd7?**

The illusion of safety is far more dangerous than if we are aware of danger, since our guard is down. Ponomariov shows up at the OK Corral at high noon, but forgets to load his gun. He takes measures against the coming Bb5+, but in the wrong way.

Later, the correct antidote was found with 8...a6! . This key defensive idea cuts out White's intended Bb5+. After 9.Qa4+

(or 9.Be3 which transposes to the note above)

9...Bd7 (Black is willing to hand over the bishop pair to unravel) 10.Nxd7 Qxd7 11.Qxd7+ Kxd7 12.dxc5 Bxc5 13.Be2 Rhd8 , White's bishop pair offers a tiny edge in the ending, R.Kasimdzhanov-J.Dorfman, German League 2002.

**9.Bb5!**

This is not just roughhousing; it is actual conflict. Life can be so beautiful when our innocent opponent walks straight into our opening preparation. Now Black experiences a shattering transition, finding himself dangerously behind in development.

**9...Bd6**

9...a6? is met with the deadly shot 10.Qf3! threatening mate, and if 10...Qf6 11.Bxd7+! (deflecting Black's bishop from coverage of b7) 11...Bxd7 12.Qxb7 . White won a pawn, while retaining the initiative.

**10.Qg4! Kf8**

In the aftermath of an incorrect plan, we become the incompetent murderer, who does his or her futile best to eradicate all forensic evidence of our past crime. This ugly move is forced. Add another problem to Black's growing list: now the h8-rook will be out of play for some time to come.

However, if: 10...O-O?? hangs material to 11.Bxd7 Bxd7 12.Bh6 g6 13.Bxf8 .

10...g6? creates a fatal dark-square puncture on the kingside after 11.Bh6 a6 12.Bxd7+ Bxd7 13.O-O-O with a winning attack for White.

**11.O-O!**

TIP: Open lines when leading in development.

Kasparov, as is his trademark, fights with zeal more than caution. He is happy to open Pandora's box with the offer of a pawn to enhance attacking chances.

A more safety-minded player would have gone for a line like 11.Qh5 Nxe5 12.dxe5 Be7 13.O-O with a risk-free initiative for White.

**11...Nxe5**

Not every problem has a solution. Some of them, we just have to learn to live with. Black may as well accept, since his position remains miserable if he declines.

**12.dxe5 Bxe5 13.Bg5 Bf6 14.Rad1**

The position feels oddly orderly/complex, as White continues to develop with tempo.

**14...Qc7**

After 14...Qb6 15.Bxf6 gxf6 16.Qh4! Ke7 17.Ba4 Black can't develop. If 17...Qxb2? 18.Rd3 Qb6 19.Rf3 e5 20.Re1 Qd6 21.Rd1 Qb6 22.Rd5! (threat: Rxe5+) 22...Qb1+ 23.Bd1 Qg6 24.Rxc5 White's attack is decisive.

**15.Qh4 Bxg5 16.Qxg5**

One look at Black's completely undeveloped army tells us the story without need of words.

**16...f6**

Black is left in anguished indecision over how to unravel. Every pawn move on the kingside weakens his king, yet he needs the move.

**17.Qh5 g6**

Another loosening move is induced, as if 17...Ke7 18.Bc4 Bd7 19.Rfe1 Rae8 20.f4! and Black's king won't survive.

**18.Qh6+ Kf7 19.Rd3?!**

White may be ready and willing, but is he able? This is yet another example of the universal truth that no good deed goes unpunished. It's amazing to me that this natural move is incorrect, yet the hateful comps demonstrate just that. Kasparov lifts in another attacker in the most natural way, yet the move is inaccurate, since it cuts off Be2 for White.

Stronger was the paradoxically more passive move 19.Rd2! . White refurbishes his attack with new recruits, but in a more modest way. This accurate move allows White's bishop access to e2: 19...a6 20.Be2! Bd7 21.Rfd1 Bc6 22.Bf3! Be8 23.Rd6 and Black is paralyzed.

**19...a6 20.Rh3!**

Threat: Qxh7+!.

Black can successfully defend after 20.Ba4?! b5 21.Bc2 Bb7 22.Rfd1 Bd5 .

**20...Qe7?!**

20...Bd7! may save Black after 21.Bd3 Rad8 22.Rg3 c4 23.Bc2 (23.Bxg6+? is unsound) 23...Qc5 . I don't see a way for White to successfully pursue his attack, and Black looks okay.

**21.Bd3**

All force is aimed at g6 and h7, which continue to fester in Black's camp.

**21...f5**

21...Bd7 is met with the familiar trick 22.Qxh7+! Rxh7 23.Rxh7+ Kf8 24.Rxe7 Kxe7 25.Bxg6 . White is up a clean pawn in the ending.

**22.g4!**

Kasparov wrings every ounce of energy from his pieces.

**22...Qf6 23.Rd1 b5 24.Be2 e5!?**

What we get isn't always what we choose. Black's dilemma: if he acts, he risks a blow-out, but if he does nothing, he risks stagnation. This is a risky unravelling attempt, which further opens the game.

Black can also take his chances with the admittedly scary line 24...g5!? 25.Qh5+ Qg6 26.gxf5 exf5 27.Rd6 Qxh5 28.Bxh5+ Ke7 29.Rc6 c4 30.Re3+ Kd7 31.Rf6 Kd8 when Black remains under pressure, but at least he has an extra pawn in the ending to comfort him.

**25.Rhd3 Ra7?**

Black had to try 25...fxg4! 26.Rd6 Qf4 27.Rxg6 Qxh6 28.Rxh6 Bf5 29.Rd5 Kg7 30.Rc6 Rhc8 with chances to hold the draw.

**26.Rd6 Qg7 27.Qe3 Rc7**

Covering c5.

**28.a4**

More confrontation.

**28...e4**

28...Rf8 was Black's best chance to resist.

**29.axb5 axb5 30.Bxb5 Qe5 31.Qg5 Qe7 32.Qh6 Be6 33.Qf4**

Kasparov missed an immediate win with 33.gxf5! Bxf5 34.Bc4+ Ke8 (the king flees with the skittering footsteps of a rabbit evading a forest predator) 35.Qf4 Rf8 36.Rd8+! Qxd8 37.Rxd8+ Kxd8 38.Qd6+ and White wins.

**33...Bc8 34.Qh6 Be6 35.gxf5!**

The endless probing begins to etch deep fissures of discontent in Black's structure. Kasparov discovers the winning idea.

**35...gxf5 36.Be2!**

Heading for h5.

**36...Qf6 37.Bh5+ Ke7**

EXERCISE (combination alert): White to play and force the win.

ANSWER: Attraction/double attack.

**38.Rxe6+!**

38.Rxe6+! Kxe6

(or 38...Qxe6 39.Qg7+ Qf7 40.Qxf7# ; is it just me, or does Black's king remind you of the bear attack on Leonardo DiCaprio in The Revenant?)

39.Rd6+ Kxd6 40.Qxf6+ Kd7 41.Qxh8 wins.

SUMMARY: The Rubinstein is a solid but passive line, suitable against aggressive opponents.

**1-0**
