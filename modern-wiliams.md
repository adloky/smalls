### (98) Modern Introduction - Modern Introduction #1

**1.e4 g6**

The Modern Defence, against we can again take over the centre.

**2.d4**

As play may transpose to a Pirc after a subsequent ...Nf6, it makes sense for White to begin in the same manner as against the Pirc, although if you like to go your own way early, 2.h4!? isn't completely ridiculous, as once covered by Colin McNab in Everyman's Dangerous Weapons series.

**2...Bg7**

Invariably played, logically completing the fianchetto.

**3.Nc3**

White continues down the standard path and now Black has three main approaches, of which the first is by far the most common form of Modern Defence: B1:3...d6 , B2:3...c6 , B3:3...c5 .

**3...d5**

This unexpected advance is also worth knowing about, if only to avoid an early surprise over the board.

**4.exd5**

Accepting the gambit. The resulting play gives White quite a nice grip on the position, but if for some reason you don't like it, you may wish to consider 4.Nxd5!? c6 5.Ne3 Qxd4 6.Bd3 , keeping the queens on with a complex struggle in fairly independent waters ahead and as played by Maxime Vachier-Lagrave.

**4...Nf6 5.Bc4**

White's main move and a logical choice, overprotecting the extra pawn.

**5...Nbd7**

Black simply wants to regain his pawn with ...Nb6.

**6.Bb3**

Good prophylaxis, retreating the bishop before it's hit and intending Ne2-f4 if Black now castles.

**6...Nb6 7.Nf3**

A change of approach and a less greedy one than 7.Qf3 . White is happy to return the pawn on d5 to exchange knights and so obtain a clamp on the centre.

**7...a5**

Black's most popular course of action, trying to disrupt.

**8.Na4**

Throwing a spanner in Black's works by retaining all the knights is likely even stronger than 8.a4 Nbxd5 9.Nxd5 Nxd5 10.O-O with similar play to our last note.

**8...Nbxd5**

8...Nxa4? 9.Bxa4+ Bd7 10.Bxd7+ Qxd7 11.c4 is just an extra pawn, and 8...Nfxd5?! 9.c4! Nf6 10.Nxb6 cxb6 11.h3! a very pleasant structural advantage and with ...Bg4 ruled out.

**9.c4**

The point of White's play and now retreating to b6 would again see Black having to endure some structural discomfort.

**9...Nb4 10.a3 Na6**

10...Nc6 11.d5 Na7 12.O-O O-O 13.Bf4 also leaves White in control of the board with Qd2 (or h3 if ...Bg4) and Rfe1 next up.

**11.O-O O-O 12.h3**

Once again, ruling out ...Bg4 can do no harm and leaves Black a little cramped and low on counterplay. White will likely follow up with Re1, Bg5 and Nc3, after which he may gradually use his extra space to build up an attack on the kingside and/or advance in the centre with a timely d5.

**12...c6**

Black fights for d5 and gives his knight on a6 a square.

**13.Nc3**

Bringing the knight on the rim back into play. Beginning with 13.Re1 also makes plenty of sense.

**13...Nc7 14.Re1 b5**

Tired of passively waiting and manoeuvring, Black lashes out, but White can deal with this bid for freedom in a calm and controlled manner.

**15.Ne5 Bb7 16.c5**

A big move and a good one. White allows Black use of d5 in return for shutting in the poor bishop on b7 and maintaining full control over the position. 16...Nfd5 17.Qf3 follows the game J.Rogers-Fernandez, British League (4NCL) (2018, where Black was outplayed in instructive fashion. Not only did he now have to deal with the concept of exchanges on d5, but also White launching a kingside attack, such as after Bd2, Rad1 and h4.)

### (99) Modern Introduction - Modern Introduction #2 

**1.e4 g6**

**2.d4**

**2...Bg7**

**3.Nc3**

**3...d5**

**4.exd5**

**4...Nf6 5.Bc4**

**5...Nbd7**

**6.Bb3**

**6...Nb6 7.Nf3**

**7...Nbxd5 8.Nxd5 Nxd5 9.O-O**

reveals White's main idea and note how there's no need to rush with c4 here. Black is hardly in a position to break with ...c5 and simply remains low on counterplay, while White builds up with Re1, possibly h3, Bg5 and then maybe Qd2 or even Ne5 and Qf3: for example,

**9...O-O**

9...Bg4?! 10.h3 is nothing to fear 10...Bxf3 11.Qxf3 c6 12.Rd1 when c4 will leave White with a dynamic and strong centre, as well as the bishop-pair.

**10.Re1 c6 11.h3**

This prevents ...Bg4 and simply intends Bg5 and Qd2 or possibly even c4, beginning to expand in the centre. The immediate 11.Bg5 isn't quite as promising, but still led to an instructive win for White in Karpatchev-Huemmer, Arco 2013. After 11.h3 an instructive example ran: 11...b6 12.c4 Nf6 13.Bg5 Bb7 14.Qe2 e6 15.Rad1 Re8 16.Ne5 with ideal centralization for White who went on to grind out the win in Dominguez Perez-Kamsky, Beijing (blitz) (2013.)

### (100) Modern Introduction - Modern Introduction #3 

**1.e4 g6**

**2.d4**

**2...Bg7**

**3.Nc3**

**3...d5**

**4.exd5**

**4...Nf6 5.Bc4**

**5...Nbd7**

**6.Bb3**

**6...Nb6 7.Nf3**

**7...O-O 8.O-O a5**

is related to 7...a5, but has the point that 9.Na4 can now be met by 9...Nxa4 10.Bxa4 (not with check) 10...Qxd5 . As such, White should go<level start="7...a5"/>

**9.a4**

keeping control ahead of an exchange of knights:

**9...Nbxd5 10.Nxd5 Nxd5 11.h3**

Once again, this feels like a useful move, preventing ...Bg4 and maintaining control. It's true that White hasn't launched an early attack, but sometimes you just have to be happy with a pleasant edge! Moreover, White certainly hasn't lost hope of gradually turning his control and extra space into an attack, as could happen after Re1, Bg5, Qd2 and Bh6.

**11...b6 12.Re1**

12...Bb7 13.Bg5 Re8 14.Qd2 Once again, we find White adopting a simple, direct and effective set-up. 14...Qd6 15.Bh6 Thematic enough, but releasing the pressure slightly and 15.Ne5! was a stronger approach, with the threat of c4, as well as ideas of Ng4 and even Bh4-g3.15...e6 16.Bxg7 Kxg7 17.Ne5 Qb4?  17...Rad8 would have been very solid for Black. 18.c3 Qd6 the bishop is untouchable due to 18...Qxb3 19.Ra3 which traps the black queen. 19.Re4 And if 19...Ne7? 20.Nxf7! Fittingly the decisive blow occurs on Black's traditionally weakest spot, f7:20...Kxf7 21.Rxe6 saw White crashing through in Robson-Hendrickson, Cleveland 2015, with the point of 21...Qxe6 22.Qf4+ Nf5 23.Qxc7+ Re7 24.Bxe6+ which led to resignation after 24...Kf8 25.Qe5<level start="15.Ne5"/><level start="17...Rad8"/><level start="18...Qxb3"/>

### (101) Modern Introduction - Modern Introduction #4 

**1.e4 g6**

**2.d4**

**2...Bg7**

**3.Nc3**

**3...d5**

**4.exd5**

**4...Nf6 5.Bc4**

**5...O-O 6.Nge2 Nbd7**

is similar, but not as good. White can just go 7.Bb3, but

**7.Nf4 Nb6 8.Bb3**

looks even stronger. Unless he wants to go in for an ugly and suspect ...g5 or ...Bh6, Black is going to struggle to regain his pawn - or obtain enough counterplay. One key point is

**8...a5 9.a4**

White maintains full control over the queenside. He is now set to simply castle, after which h3 and Re1 will again be useful moves. Black can sit and suffer or try to change the structure, but in any case is clearly worse: 9...c6!? 10.dxc6 bxc6 11.O-O Qd6 12.Re1 Continuing the simple and strong, as well as classically-approved plan. 12...Bg4 13.Qd3 Rfd8 14.h3 Bf5 15.Qf3 This simply left Black a pawn down for almost nothing in Chatalbashev-Garc√≠a Castro, Mondariz 2002, where White was set to complete development with Be3 and Rad1.

### (102) Modern Introduction - Modern Introduction #5 

**1.e4 g6**

**2.d4**

**2...Bg7**

**3.Nc3**

**3...a6**

is, once again, also possible when after

**4.Be2**

Black can take play into Line B1 with 4...d6. Should he instead prefer immediate expansion, don't forget that White too can play on both flanks - and with some power:

**4...b5 5.h4 h5**

or 5...b4 6.Nd5 Bb7 . Here 7.Bf3 is tempting, as is the simple 7.h5!? e6 With a bishop on g7, Black can now simply meet 8.hxg6 with 8...hxg6 8.Nxb4 Bxe4 9.Bf3 . The knight on b4 may look a little unusual, but will be quite well placed on d3. Meanwhile White enjoys smooth development and may throw a spoke into Black's wheel with a timely h6 should ...Nf6 occur.

**6.a4**

Softening Black up on the queenside, but there's also nothing wrong with one of our favourite plans, 6.Nf3 and 7.Ng5.<addx start="7.Ng5"/>

**6...b4 7.Nd5 Bb7 8.Bf3**

still feels like a pleasant edge for White. Not only is b4 en prise, but e5 is an idea and there are also just the two ever decent mini-plans: c3, to challenge on the queenside and bolster d4, and Nh3-g5. Note too that 8...Bxd5 9.exd5 d6 10.Nh3 would leave White with quite a grip on the position, which he might exploit by probing on the queenside, beginning with a5 and c3.

### (103) Modern Introduction - Modern Introduction #6 

**1.e4 g6**

**2.d4**

In about 10% of games, Black chooses something else, but after

**2...d6**

1...d6 2.d4 g6 also leads to this position

**3.Nc3**

we should probably also mention

**3...a6**

which can be calmly and well met by

**4.Be2**

Now Black should probably head into the waters of Line B1 with 4...Bg7 as

**4...b5**

again looks a little risky for him:

**5.h4**

Following the prescribed method and a strong advance of Harry.

**5...Bb7**

5...h5 is probably safer, although here White can strike on the queenside and expand with tempo: 6.a4! b4 7.Nd5 a5 8.Nf3 . Already Black's light squares and kingside look a little vulnerable with Ng5, Nf4 and Bc4 on their way in some order, while c3 will likely also prove useful, challenging the queenside, overprotecting d4 and facilitating Qb3. We'll see much more of such ideas in Line B1.

**6.h5 b4 7.Nd5**

Already Black is under heavy pressure and vulnerable on both flanks. A well-timed h6 may prove problematic or just the line-opening exchange on g6, not least in the event of 7...e6? 8.hxg6! fxg6 9.Nf4 when Black's position collapses on the light squares: 9...Bxe4 10.Bf3!? or just 10.Nxe6 Qe7 11.d5, 10...Nf6 11.Bxe4 Nxe4 12.Qf3 completes the ruin, after which e6 or g6 will fall with fatal consequences.<level start="10.Nxe6"/>

### (104) Modern Introduction - Modern Introduction #7 

**1.e4 g6**

**2.d4**

**2...d6**

**3.Nc3**

**3...a6**

**4.Be2**

**4...b5**

**5.h4**

**5...h5**

is probably safer, although here White can strike on the queenside and expand with tempo:

**6.a4 b4 7.Nd5 a5 8.Nf3**

Already Black's light squares and kingside look a little vulnerable with Ng5, Nf4 and Bc4 on their way in some order, while c3 will likely also prove useful, challenging the queenside, overprotecting d4 and facilitating Qb3. We'll see much more of such ideas in Line B1.

### (105) Modern Introduction - Modern Introduction #8 

**1.e4 g6**

**2.d4**

**2...Nf6**

is Magnus Carlsen's favourite surprise weapon against lower-rated opponents at blitz, the North Sea Defence:

**3.e5 Nh5**

3...Nd5?! 4.c4 Nb6 5.c5!? Nd5 6.Bc4 is just a bad version of an Alekhine for Black: 6...c6 7.Nf3 d6 8.exd6 exd6 9.O-O ! when Black will come under an early assault down the e-file, with Ng5 also likely to prove quite problematic for him.

**4.Be2**

Simple chess and consistent with our general approach. 4.Nf3 d6 5.Bc4 is also quite promising with Ng5 on its way.

**4...d6 5.f4**

Simple chess, seizing space. 5.Bxh5 gxh5 6.Qxh5?! dxe5 7.Qxe5 Rg8 actually offers Black good counterplay, but Caruana and Leko have made a decent case for the simple approach, 5.exd6 .

**5...Ng7**

Probably wise, or at least 5...dxe5? 6.fxe5 c5 7.d5! is an excellent version of a Four Pawns Alekhine for White, with Black's knight rather misplaced on h5 and Nc3, Nf3 and O-O on their way, not to mention a well-timed g4. Note too that 7...e6 8.Nc3 Qh4+? is nothing to fear: 9.g3! Nxg3 10.Nf3 Qh5 11.Bb5+ Everything comes with tempo. 11...Bd7 12.Rg1 when Black is just getting crushed and will have to shed serious material, as after 12...Nf5 13.Rg5 Qh3 14.Bf1 . 5...c5 6.d5 also looks like a lot of fun for White with his powerful centre: for example, 6...Ng7 7.Nf3 Nf5 8.c3 Preparing a powerful g4 advance without being able to sacrifice a pawn for some play with ...Nd4 in response. 8...h5 9.O-O Bg7 10.Bd3!? The d5-pawn is taboo due to a certain check on b5.10...O-O 11.Be4 . The bishop radiates power in all directions from e4, making it harder for Black to develop with ...Nd7 or ...e6. White will follow up with Na3-c4 or c4 and Nc3 and will eventually prepare to strike against Black's weakened kingside with Ng5 and e6.

**6.Nf3 h5**

6...Bg4 7.h3 Bxf3 8.Bxf3 would be the alternative for Black, but also looks quite grim for him. White may expand with c4 and Qb3, with Be3-f2 another important idea, preventing a black knight on f5 from causing any real havoc.

**7.O-O Nf5 8.Na3**

Preparing to challenge Black's knight with Nc4-e3 or c3 and Nc2-e3. Black's position is solid, but he is low on counterplay and that, allied to his slight cramp and inferior development, should gradually cost him 8...Bh6?! 9.c3 Usefully enough bolstering White's big centre. 9...O-O We've followed the game Ebeling-Vakhidov, Tromsoe Olympiad 2014, where 10.Nc4 would have left White in full control. He may simply drive away Black's best piece with Bd3 and Ne3, while another very tempting idea is Qe1, intending h3 and g4, and all the while ...c5 can simply be met by an exchange on c5 to retain full control of the central situation.

### (106) Modern Introduction - Modern Introduction #9 

**1.e4 g6**

**2.d4**

**2...Nf6**

**3.e5 Nh5**

**4.Be2**

**4...d6 5.f4**

**5...c5 6.d5**

also looks like a lot of fun for White with his powerful centre: for example,

**6...Ng7 7.Nf3 Nf5 8.c3**

Preparing a powerful g4 advance without Black being able to sacrifice a pawn for some play with ...Nd4 in response.

**8...h5 9.O-O Bg7 10.Bd3**

The d5-pawn is taboo due to a certain check on b5.

**10...O-O 11.Be4**

The bishop radiates power in all directions from e4, making it harder for Black to develop with ...Nd7 or ...e6. White will follow up with Na3-c4 or c4 and Nc3 and will eventually limber up to trying to strike against Black's weakened kingside after Ng5 and e6.

### (107) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #1 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

We stick with this seemingly innocuous move, but once again with no intention of playing quietly, Classical Pirc style. If you prefer, the immediate 4.h4!? is also very much an option, if one less likely to surprise a Modern player, especially at fast time limits. 4.Be2 has been over 90% less common than the popular 4.Be3 here, so should surprise. With 4.Be2 we once again most certainly do not renounce an early advance of Harry and are also being quite pragmatic. By far Black's most popular choice here is 4...Nf6 when we're suddenly back into the Pirc and 5.h4 waters.

**4...a6**

Black insists on developing in Tiger Modern fashion. As well as 4...Nf6, he also has:

**5.h4**

With Black busying himself for queenside counterplay, there's no reason to hold back on Harry.

**5...h5**

Wisely keeping lines closed and not 5...Nf6? 6.Bg5 b5? 7.e5! , as we saw back at the start of our Pirc coverage. Your opponent may have some experience with the structure after 5...h5 , but they will likely be much more used to reaching it with White having a bishop on e3, not e2. There are, unsurprisingly, some important differences.

**6.Nf3**

Our standard prescription, eyeing a timely leap to g5 and we saw 6...Nf6 7.Ng5 back in Line A6.

**6...b5**

Black's thematic queenside expansion.

**7.a4**

Again we see this undermining idea to break up Black's queenside pawns. It's not every day that you get to push both rook's pawns two squares in the first seven moves! Good alternatives are 7.Ng5 and 7.Be3 , keeping all White's options open.

**7...b4**

7...bxa4?! 8.O-O looks very pleasant for White, with ideas of Ng5 and possibly Bc4, as well as of e5 if Black is careless. There's always also just Rxa4, after which Bg5, Qd2 and Rfa1 might leave Black under pressure on both flanks.

**8.Nd5**

Leaping forwards and, well, why not?

**8...Bb7 9.Ng5**

Continuing to go forwards.

**9...c5**

A move Black would like to play, but it asks too much of his position.

**10.Bc4**

Beginning to take aim at f7.

**10...e6 11.Nf4**

Again this is a powerful retreat, pressing on e6 and g6, whereas the 11.Qf3 of Bratanov-Lafaurie, French League 2007, actually wouldn't have been so clear after the calm 11...Nf6! .

**11...cxd4**

Easy to criticise, but what else can Black do?

**12.Nxf7**

Ol√©!

**12...Kxf7 13.Nxe6**

White has just a pawn for the piece, but clearly has quite some pressure down the a2-g8 diagonal and enjoys more than enough compensation.

**13...Qc8 14.Bb3 Nc6**

14...d5? 15.exd5 doesn't block the key diagonal for long with d6 already imminent, as well as just O-O.

**15.Bg5**

White threatens Nd8+ and enjoys a very strong attack for the piece. One possible continuation:

**15...Bf6**

15...Na5? loses to 16.Nd8+ Ke8 17.Qf3 .

**16.a5**

Preventing the annoying ...Na5.

**16...Bxg5 17.hxg5 Nge7 18.f4**

White is all set to blast ahead with O-O and f5, and it remains far from clear just how on earth Black is supposed to safeguard his king and coordinate his position. He can dodge the checks at last, but... 18...Ke8 19.f5! gxf5 20.exf5 Nxf5 21.O-O! ...rips open lines with decisive effect. Yes, Black can now go a rook ahead, but just look at the state of the major pieces, all on his bank rank. 21...Ne3 22.Qd3 Nxf1 23.Qg6+ Kd7 24.Rxf1 Ne7, 24...Re8 25.Rf7+ Re7 26.Nf4! is also hopeless, followed by Be6+ or Nd5 or 26...Qe8 27.Qe6+ Kd8 28.Qxd6+ Rd7 29.Rxd7+ Qxd7 30.Ne6+ Kc8 31.Qf8+ Nd8 32.g6! and Gary's a winner. 25.Rf7 Re8 26.Qf5 when there's just no good move in view of 26...Kc6? 27.Ba4#<level start="24...Re8"/><level start="26...Qe8"/>

continues to develop a tempo:

Threatening Nf4+ .

**15...Kg8 16.Qxd4 Kh7 17.f4**

The pin down the h4-d8 diagonal indirectly protects the e4-pawn and Black is simply in big trouble with e5 one threat, f5 gxf5, Rxf5 another, and 17...Nc6 18.Qb6 Rab8 cleaned up by 19.e5! dxe5 20.f5! An unusual version of a standard line-closing for Black and opening for White pawn sacrifice, most commonly seen in Modern Benoni positions. 20...gxf5 21.Rxf5 when the defence is simply overloaded with even 21...Rhf8 22.Raf1! failing to help Black.

This check is a key point, displacing Black's king and leaving him in huge trouble after dxc5 and Be3.

**8.Nd5**

**8...Bb7 9.Ng5**

**9...c5**

**10.Bc4**

**10...Nh6**

would overprotect f7, but still feels quite suspect for Black after

**11.Nf4**

White threatens Bxf7+ Nxf7; Nge6 and even

**11...Bxd4 12.c3**

supplies a big initiative after Qb3. For example: 12...Bf6, 12...bxc3? 13.Qb3 cxb2 14.Bxb2 simply carries too many threats. 13.Qb3 e6 14.cxb4 when even 14...Nc6 doesn't really help Black in view of 15.Bxe6! fxe6 16.bxc5 Talk about complete collapse on the light squares. 16...dxc5 16...Nd4? 17.Qxb7 Nc2+ 18.Kd1 Nxa1 19.Qc6+ is game over. 17.Ngxe6 Qd7 18.Nd5! and the initiative just keeps rumbling on, which is no surprise considering the state of Black's ragged forces.<level start="12...bxc3"/>

### (115) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #9

**8.Nd5**

**8...Bb7 9.Ng5**

**9...Bxd5 10.exd5 Nf6**

would be more sensible, but

**11.O-O**

is not so easy to handle 11.c4!? bxc3 12.bxc3 Nxd5 13.Bf3 c6 14.O-O also offers lasting compensation. White offers a pawn to increase his lead in development and simply wants to blast ahead with f4-f5. This looks pretty dangerous and Black probably has to grab:

**11...Nxd5 12.Bd3**

Threatening Qf3.

**12...Nd7 13.Qe2**

13.Bxg6 fxg6 is simply fiendishly unclear after 14.Qd3 , as 14.Ne6? Qc8 15.Nxg7+ Kf7 traps the knight.

**13...N7f6 14.f4**

White is again ready to blast ahead with f5, although even a slower approach with Bd2 and c4 would be far from terrible. His attacking chances, bishop-pair and dominant knight on g5 leave him with good compensation.

### (116) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #10

fails to keep lines closed:

**14.d5 exd5**

or 14...Nxd5? 15.Bxg6 fxg6 16.Nxe6 when everything hangs

**15.Re1+ Kf8 16.Bxg6**

and Black is undone by the potential fork on e6.

### (117) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #11

**5.h4**

**5...h5**

**6.Nf3**

**6...b5**

**7.a4**

**7...b4**

**8.Nd5**

As well as trying to counter in the centre, Black does have the slow

**8...a5**

but then

**9.c3**

both challenges him anew while offering some useful overprotection to d4. After

**9...e6 10.Nf4**

White's knights will look quite menacing once Ng5 has been played, with Black now looking more overextended than awash with counterplay on the queenside.

### (118) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #12 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**6.Nf3**

**6...b5**

**7.a4**

**7...b4**

**8.Nd5**

**8...Nf6 9.Nxf6+ exf6**

is another possibility we should mention. This does keep White out of g5, but after

**10.O-O O-O 11.c3**

White should again have an edge. He can overprotect e4 with Bd3 and Re1, if needed, with Nd2 and f4 very much an idea too. Yet again, finding good counterplay for Black is not so easy, partly as

**11...bxc3 12.bxc3 f5**

is well met by 13.Bg5 and the simpler

**13.e5 dxe5 14.Nxe5**

followed by Bf3 or 14...Bb7 15.Bg5! f6? 16.Nxg6 fxg5 17.Bc4+ Kh7 18.Qxh5+ Bh6 19.Rfe1 with a winning attack after Re6 or Re7+. And if 14...Qxh4 15.Bf3 is quite awkward, as 15...Ra7? walks into 16.Nxg6! fxg6 17.Qb3+

### (119) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #14 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**4...a6**

**5.h4**

**5...h5**

**6.Nf3**

**6...Nc6**

can hardly be terrible, but feels a little slow in conjunction with ...a6. Indeed, 7.Be3 should be quite pleasant for White or even

**7.d5 Ne5 8.Nxe5 Bxe5 9.Be3**

Whi@e now has ideas of Qd2 (or Qd3) and O-O-O, as well as of f4 and he may well also seek to exchange off Black's better bishop with Bd4.

### (120) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #15 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**4...a6**

**5.h4**

**5...h5**

**6.Nf3**

**6...c6**

also feels a little strange here, but was seen in Benjamin-Lein, New York 1989:

**7.Ng5 b5 8.a4**

White follows up the thematic knight leap by immediately striking out on the queenside. One point is to try and deflect Black's bishop, i.e.

**8...Bb7**

8...b4 was preferred in the game, where we're not sure how Joel resisted 9.Bc4!? followed by redeploying the knight to e2 once Black covers f7. Yes, he really must as 9...bxc3? 10.Bxf7+ Kd7 11.bxc3! is simply superb compensation for a piece. White now threatens Ne6 and 11...Kc7 12.Bxg6 will be four pawns for the piece once h5 falls as Black counters the threat of Nf7, all the while as White can look to maintain the initiative with O-O, Re1 and e5 and likely Rb1 at some stage.

**9.f4**

when White is simply going to blast ahead with f5.

### (121) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #16 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**4...a6**

**5.h4**

Once again, we should also consider the other line-closing attempt that is

**5...h6**

Here, however, it appears that White can proceed full steam ahead:

**6.h5 g5 7.f4 gxf4 8.Bxf4**

The only reason for not bulldozing ahead so would be if Black could arrange a strong ...e5 counterstrike, but while he can break, White can retain control. As such, we have to disagree with that classic book 'Tiger's Modern', where Tiger Hillarp Persson described the position as 'very nice for Black'. Let's see why:

**8...Nc6**

8...Nd7!? 9.Nf3 c5 is preferred by the engines, but here White has at least 10.Qd2 cxd4 11.Nxd4 and Nf5 or 11...Nc5 12.Nb3! Nxb3 13.axb3 , retaining control in a slightly messy pawn structure. While White may be able to go long, his king is currently quite safe on e1, keeping options open, with the simple plan of Be3 and Nd5.

**9.Nf3 Bg4**

9...Nxd4 10.Nxd4 e5 has also been tried, but 11.Be3 exd4 12.Bxd4 maintained control in Bjornsson-Johannesson, Reykjavik 2006, where 12...Rh7 might just have been met by 13.Nd5 , tying Black's queen to c7 and only then going Qd3 and O-O-O.

**10.d5**

A timely upping of the ante.

**10...Bxf3 11.gxf3**

Opening the g-file.

**11...Nd4 12.Be3 Nxe2 13.Nxe2**

White is quite happy to trade b2 for b7 and plays on his significant space advantage. Black tried 13...c5 in Faerman-Thiede, Vienna 2009, where 14.c3 followed by Qb3 and Ng3 was one approach. The more aggressive 14.dxc6!? bxc6 15.c3 another. The idea is simply Nd4-f5 and even Nf4-d5 becomes possible if Black goes ...c5. All the while, White will likely complete development with Qc2, (a3 if needed after ...Qa5) (and O-O-O, leaving his king somewhat safer than its counterpart and Black likely to come under pressure down the g-file and on h6.)

### (122) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #17 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**4...c6**

is, as we've seen, quite a common move in these Pirc/ Modern positions, but here it does nothing to dissuade our favourite advance:

**5.h4**

5.f4 looking to get in a quick e4-e5 is also quite tempting against the slightly slow 4...c6. Now 5...Nf6 6.h4 would take us back into Line A3 of our Pirc coverage, but Black may instead seek counterplay or block our favorite h4-h5 advance:<level start="4...c6"/>

**5...h5 6.Nf3**

Our standard development, heading for g5 and readying for a transposition back to Line A6 after 6...Nf6 7.Ng5 . Independent options for Black might now again include an attempt to pressure d4:

**6...Bg4 7.Ng5**

Our thematic leap to avoid an exchange on f3.

**7...Bxe2 8.Nxe2**

Moving the knight over to the kingside while also facilitating c2-c3 if required to bolster d4. Aggressive souls may also wish to consider Mestrovic's 8.Qxe2!? with the idea of 8...Bxd4 9.Qc4 Bxc3+ 10.Qxc3 , swapping the d-pawn for the dark squares and an initiative.

**8...Nd7 9.O-O**

This feels like an edge for White, in part thanks to his mighty knight on g5 and also flexibility. The bishop's pawns might be quite happy on c3 and f3 as part of a restraining policy, possibly in conjunction with an a4 advance, or White might simply blast ahead with f4: for example: 9...Ngf6 10.f4 threatening the good old e5-e6.10...e5 11.f5 Qe7 12.c3 when Qb3 will increase the pressure and 12...O-O-O 13.Ng3 maintains control. Black is scarcely in a position to launch an attack on the kingside here and White may complete development with Qd3 and Be3, even get Alfie quickly involved with a4-a5, and d5 is another idea, aiming to close the centre before attacking on the queenside, or if cxd5; exd5 when a white knight will be able to sit pretty on e4.

### (123) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #18 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**4...c6**

**5.h4**

**5...h5 6.Nf3**

**6...Nd7 7.Be3**

means that White can at least meet 7...Qb6 with 8.a3 , if not 8.O-O!? . Instead,

**7...Qc7 8.Ng5 Ngf6**

only now became Pirc-like in Bigg-McNab, Coulsdon 2005, where 9.f4 Nb6 wasn't so clear, but

**9.a4**

would have been quite strong. White again puts the kibosh on Black's queenside counterplay and may now follow up with O-O and f4 or even

**9...a5 10.Qd3**

which also keeps open the option of going long and even allows White to consider

**10...O-O 11.g4**

suddenly switching straight to direct and strong attacking mode:

**11...hxg4 12.h5 gxh5 13.f3 gxf3 14.Bxf3**

would surely leave Black unlikely to survive down the g- and h-files after O-O-O and Rdg1.

### (124) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #19 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**4...c6**

**5.h4**

**5...Qb6**

is a bit risky, exposing the queen to potential attack after Be3 or a4-a5, but does strike straight at d4 when White isn't in a good position to gambit: 6.Be3? Qxb2

**6.Nf3 Bg4**

6...Nf6 is yet to be tried here, but would prevent h4-h5. As such White should look to seize space elsewhere: 7.a4!? 7...a5 8.e5 . Now if the knight moves White will get in h4-h5, so an exchange is likely: 8...dxe5 9.Nxe5 . White is now ready to go h4-h5 and Black probably shouldn't block: 9...h5?! 10.Bc4 e6 11.O-O . This feels like a small, but pleasant edge for White. Re1 and Bg5 may follow, with another idea to note that of Ra3, not only facilitating Rb3 or Bg5 without dropping the b-pawn, but hoping for a timely rook swing to g3 with Black potentially vulnerable to a piece sacrifice on g6.

**7.Bc4**

White sacrifices a tempo with the bishop, but threatens Bxf7+ and intends aggressive central play:

**7...e6**

Of course, 7...Bxd4?? 8.Qxd4 and 7...Nd7? 8.Bxf7+! Kxf7 9.Ng5+ Ke8 10.Qxg4 Bxd4 11.O-O are somewhat inadvisable for Black.

**8.Bb3 Bxf3**

Otherwise, White would simply go 9.Be3 .

**9.Qxf3 Qxd4 10.h5 Nd7 11.Bf4**

White threatens Rd1 and even a sneaky defense may not enable Black to equalize: 11...Bh6!?, 11...e5?? 12.Be3 would carry a certain double threat, 11...Qf6 12.Qg3! keeps the queens on before harvesting d6 or much more if 12...e5?? 13.Bg5 and 11...Be5 12.Rd1 will win the pawn back with a bishop-pair plus after a forcing line: 12...Qc5 13.hxg6 hxg6 14.Rxh8 Bxh8 15.Bxd6. 12.Rd1 Qf6 13.Bxd6 Qxf3 14.gxf3 . After 14...Ngf6 Black has at least manage to stabilize matters and develop his kingside, but White's bishops and the hole on d6 may still promise an edge after 15.hxg6 hxg6 16.f4 O-O-O 17.Ke2 The king can now come to f3 in many lines and White will strive to break with f4-f5 to open up the bishop on b3.<add start="12.Rd1" value="11...Bh6"/>

### (125) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #20 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**4...c6**

**5.h4**

**5...Qb6**

**6.Nf3 Bg4**

**7.Bc4**

**7...e6**

**8.Bb3 Bxf3**

**9.Qxf3 Qxd4 10.h5**

Good defence. Black otherwise finds his queen and/or d6 quickly becoming a target:

**10...Qf6 11.Qg3 Qe7 12.Bf4**

forces further weaknesses

**12...e5 13.Bg5 Bf6 14.hxg6 fxg6 15.Be3**

when the bishop on b3 is a monster and

**15...Nd7 16.O-O-O**

followed by Rd3 keeps Black rather bottled up

### (126) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #21 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**4...c6**

**5.h4**

**5...Qb6**

**6.Nf3 Bg4**

**7.Bc4**

**7...e6**

**8.Bb3 Bxf3**

**9.Qxf3 Qxd4 10.h5 Nf6 11.Be3 Qe5 12.Bf4**

Once again we find Black under heavy pressure on d6 and down the h-file, with h5-h6 very much an idea, as well as hxg6 for White:

**12...Qc5 13.h6 Bf8 14.e5 dxe5 15.Be3 Qe7 16.Bg5 Nbd7 17.O-O-O**

wins material due to the pin.

### (127) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #22 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**4...c6**

**5.h4**

**5...Qb6**

**6.Nf3 Bg4**

**7.Bc4**

**7...e6**

**8.Bb3 Bxf3**

**9.Qxf3 Bxd4 10.Bf4**

followed by O-O-O also feels like good compensation: for example,

**10...Be5 11.O-O-O Qc7 12.h5**

leaves Black creaking badly on the light squares and down the d- and h-files.

### (128) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #23 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**4...c6**

**5.h4**

**5...Qb6**

**6.Nf3 Bg4**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Nf6**

overprotects the bishop, but also creates a target:

**8.e5 Nd5**

We hope you know what's wrong with 8...dxe5? 9.Bxf7+! Kxf7 10.Nxe5+ Ke8 11.Nxg4 - do brush up on your basic tactics if not!

**9.exd6**

The right central exchange. White is now ready to capture on d5 and 9...exd6? also exposes Black down the e-file, whether White prefers 10.Qe2+ or even 10.O-O , so Black likely has to try to block:

**9...e6 10.O-O O-O 11.Ne4**

White is now ready to go c2-c3, so Black is pretty much forced into exchanges: 11...Bxf3 12.Qxf3 Qxd4 13.Bb3 The knight on d5 remains pretty strong and the d6-pawn isn't entirely secure, but we still quite like White's active pieces and bishop-pair, with h4-h5 very much on the horizon and Black also potentially vulnerable on f6 after Bg5 and c2-c4. For example: 13...Qe5 14.Bg5 Nd7 or 14...h6 15.Bd2 Nd7 16.c4 N5f6 17.Nxf6+ Nxf6 18.Rad1 When if Delroy leaves the board then after 18...Qxd6 White can either remove h6 or pocket the exchange with 19.Bf4 and Bd6. 15.Rfe1 h6 What else to try with c2-c4 such a big threat? 16.Bd2 Qxb2 17.Rad1 and White enjoys decent compensation. He threatens to seriously inconvenience Black's queen with Bc1, c2-c4 is still in the position and h4-h5 may finally arrive.<add start="15.Rfe1" value="13...Qe5 14.Bg5 Nd7"/>

### (129) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #24 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**4...Nc6**

str@kes straight at d4 and is better-timed than with ... Nf6 and h4 inserted (Line A4). White should avoid 5.d5 Nd4 in favour of the flexible

**5.Be3**

when Black can either head for Pirc waters or react in the centre:

**5...Nf6 6.d5**

A change of approach as 6.h4 h5 7.Nf3 Ng4 is slightly annoying, if far from bad for White. We should also mention 6.g4!? , a delayed Spike, when White may be able to press ahead with g5 and h4, or just expand after h3 and f4. The text is also quite aggressive.

**6...Ne5**

6...Nb8 has been less common, but is likely a more prudent choice. Now 7.g4!? turned out well enough in Chepukaitis-Pliasunov, St Petersburg 2000, and White can also consider, on top of developing too, our favourite advance: 7.h4!? h5 8.Nf3 . Yet again, Ng5 is the plan and now ...Ng4 can be met by Bd4. White may go Qd2 and O-O-O, but a switch of focus with O-O is very possible too, after which a4 may be a useful advance, as well as f4. And, finally, we should mention that 8...O-O 9.Ng5 would return play to a position we considered in Line A6 via 6...Nc6 there.<skip start="6...Nc6"/>

**7.f4**

Taking up the challenge.

**7...Ned7**

7...Neg4?! 8.Bd4 fails to inconvenience White as Black can't hit back fast enough in the centre, i.e. 8...c5?, 8...e5? 9.dxe6 Bxe6 10.Bxg4! wins a piece: 10...Bxg4 11.Bxf6, 9.dxc6 followed by e5 or 9...e5 10.fxe5 dxe5 11.Bc5!? Qxd1+ 12.Rxd1 bxc6 13.h3 Nh6 14.Nf3 with much the healthier pieces for White.<add start="9.dxc6" value="8...c5"/>

**8.g4**

It's hard not to be drawn to this Stockfish-approved idea and improved Spike. White simply wants to suffocate Black after g5 Ng8; Bd4 and also has a devious pawn sacrifice in mind:

**8...h6**

8...O-O ?! 9.g5 Ne8 hopes for 10.Bd4 e5! , but White found something much stronger in: Hawkes-Babb, Edmonton 1980:10.h4! . The simple plan is h5 and Qd2 and surely nobody would want to face such an attack down the h-file as Black.

**9.Nf3 Nxg4 10.Bd4**

White has sacrificed a pawn for quite some initiative. He'd love to see his queen land in the centre of the board and e5 is very much imminent. Black probably has to try

**10...Ngf6**

10...O-O ? 11.Bxg7 Kxg7 12.Qd4+ followed by e5 and O-O-O is surely just too strong an attack.

**11.e5 Nh5 12.e6**

White will target g6 and Black is most certainly under pressure: For example, 12...fxe6 13.Nh4 Even 13.dxe6!? Ndf6 14.Nh4! Nxf4 15.Rf1 turns out very well for White according to the engines. 13...Bxd4 14.Qxd4 e5 Desperately trying to deflect White with there being no good way to cover g6.15.fxe5 dxe5 16.Qe3 Nf4 17.O-O-O This feels like excellent compensation for two pawns - just look at White's lead in development! Already Nxg6 Nxg6; Bh5 is a threat and Black is struggling to untangle, as shown by 17...Nf6 Hoping for 18.Qxe5 Qd6 18.Bb5+! Kf8 19.Nf3!? Ng4 20.Qd2 Qd6 21.Rde1 when White is in no rush and now threatens Nxe5, as well as just h3, all the while as Black's position continues to resemble a Swiss cheese.<level start="13.dxe6"/>

### (130) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #25 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**4...Nc6**

**5.Be3**

**5...e5**

is the independent Modern approach, but just as in our Pirc coverage, White does quite well by resolving the tension on e5:

**6.dxe5 Nxe5**

6...dxe5 7.Qxd8+ leaves Black struggling as he has no pawn on c6 to cover the key b5 and d5 points, and 7...Nxd8 8.Nb5 Ne6 9.Nxa7 Bd7 10.Nb5 simply bagged a pawn in Barua-Khamdamov, Teheran 1998.

**7.Qd2 Be6 8.O-O-O**

is a pretty attractive set-up for White. Once again, h4 and if ...h5, Nh3-g5 is an idea, f4 and Nf3 perhaps an even better one. After that latter set-up, White may even be able to get in h3 and g4 or begin to seize the initiative with

**8...Nf6 9.f4 Neg4 10.Bxg4 Nxg4 11.Bd4**

which preserves the key bishop, while leaving Black both low on counterplay and vulnerable on the kingside.

### (131) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #26 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**4...Nd7**

feels a little old-fashioned and committal. White might respond with 5.f4 , stay flexible with 5.Be3 or simply push Harry:

**5.h4 h5 6.Nf3**

The knight may well come to g5, especially if Black develops with ...Ngf6. He likely does better to avoid such Pirc style play, but even so may struggle slightly for counterplay:

**6...c6 7.a4 Nh6 8.O-O**

Having prevented ...b5, White houses his king and will expand with Bc4 and e5 if Black does nothing. A further queenside advance in a5 is very much an idea too, with the aim to limit Black's counterplay while improving White's pieces. For example: 8...O-O 8...Ng4?! 9.Ng5 simply looks a little pointless for Black with f3 and Bc4 on their way. Even 9.Nh2!? with various kingside designs isn't ridiculous.

### (132) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #27 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**4...Nd7**

**5.h4 h6**

hopes for 6.f4 h5! followed by maintaining control of the kingside with ... Ndf6 and ...Nh6. As such,

**6.Be3**

is @ensible, keeping White's options open. One simple plan is Qd2, O-O-O and h5, looking to meet ...g5 with g3 and f4 to open lines. Another possibility generated by the knight on d7 (try to always ask yourself, what does my opponent's move allow that I couldn't do before, as well as what's their threat and plan?) is

**6...Ngf6 7.Nh3**

the idea f4 under improved circumstances, i.e.

**7...c6 8.f4 h5 9.f5**

when Black will come under pressure after Ng5 or Nf4 and White will most likely castle long.

### (133) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #28 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**4...Nd7**

**5.h4 c5**

also strives to make a virtue of the knight being on d7 and was even tried by a young Magnus. For once our central exchange doesn't cut the mustard, as 6.dxc5 Nxc5 merely activates Black's pieces. As such, the choice is between 6.d5 and

**6.Be3**

White maintains his centre, is ready to go h5 and/or Qd2, and should be happy with a Dragon structure:

**6...cxd4 7.Bxd4 Ngf6 8.h5**

This looks like a dream opening for White and all because Black's queen's knight can't come to c6. As well as Qd2 and O-O-O, White is ready to cramp with h6 and may even get in g4-g5.

### (134) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #29 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**4...Nd7**

**5.h4 c5**

**6.Be3**

**6...h5 7.Nf3**

heads for g5 in typical fashion and once again Black would do well to avoid the obvious development:

**7...Ngf6 8.e5 Ng4 9.e6 fxe6**

when both 10.Ng5 and

**10.Qd3**

simply leave White with a venomous, early initiative as g6 is dropping.

### (135) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #30 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**4...e6**

heads for a Hippo-type set-up, but also feels a little slow:

**5.h4**

And why not?

**5...h6**

This is generally how Hippo players like to go, rather than see 5...h5 6.Nf3 Nd7 7.Ng5 when Be3, O-O and f4 may follow, looking to crash through with a timely f5.

**6.Be3**

Sensible and aggressive development while avoiding 6.f4 h5 .

**6...Nd7 7.Qd2 a6 8.f4**

Only now does White advance so, with a clear route to c1 open for his king and ....h5 unconvincing for Black:

**8...h5 9.f5 exf5 10.exf5**

Already Black faces a choice of evils: to allow a weak point on g6 and Nf3-g5 or to see his kingside shattered after

**10...gxf5**

The latter may hope for ...Ndf6-g4, but White too has his squares on the kingside and

**11.Bf3 Ndf6 12.Bg5 Ne7 13.Nh3**

followed by Nf4 and O-O-O leaves Black nursing weaknesses, low on counterplay and with the problem of what to do with his king.

### (136) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #31 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**4...e6**

**5.h4**

**5...h6**

**6.Be3**

**6...Nd7 7.Qd2 a6 8.f4**

**8...b5 9.h5 gxh5**

also looked rather unconvincing back in Dobrovolsky-Knaak, Cesky Brod 1970, where White might even have gone

**10.Bf3 Bb7 11.Nge2**

followed by Ng3 with a dream centre and kingside targets.

### (137) Modern B1: 3...d6 - B1: 3...d6 #32 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Be2**

**4...b6**

might also be chosen by a Hippo fan, but is slow and rather asks for Harry:

**5.h4**

White's idea of h5 is obvious and Viktor Moskalenko was a slightly lucky boy when he got away with an immediate central counter:

**5...h5 6.Nf3 Bb7 7.Ng5 e6 8.Be3**

White cannot be unhappy. The knight on g5 is yet again rather powerful, Qd2 and O-O-O may follow, and as well as f4, White can look to break with g4, as well as d5. That central advance closes down the bishop on b7 and can be pretty powerful with a knight on g5. A sample line: 8...Nd7 9.Qd2 Ne7 10.O-O-O a6 sees Black making all the standard Hippo moves, but White now beats him to the bounce and rips open the position: 11.g4! Nf6 12.gxh5 Nxh5 13.d5! exd5 or 13...e5 14.f4 , beginning to target f7.14.Bd4 In return for the pawn, White has the initiative and much the safer king, which should all add up to quite some advantage.

### (138) Modern B2: 3...c6 - B2: 3...c6 #1 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c6**

Black hints at ...d5, but also doesn't commit to anything just yet, meaning that ...d6 and ...Nf6, Pirc style, is very much still on the table too.

**4.Be2**

We too wait with this rare move, which may well throw opponents on to their own resources at a very early stage. White gets closer to castling kingside, most certainly doesn't fear 4...d5 and even keeps Harry primed for action. 4.Nf3 d5 5.h3 and 4.f4 d5 5.e5 are the two main lines, with 4.Bc4!? and if 4...d6 5.Qf3 another decent option for White.

**4...d5**

The@move which Black's last seemingly prepared and his most popular choice. Alternatives are extremely rare apart from 4...d6 5.h4 when we're back into Line B1.4...Qb6 strikes at d4 when we can't really gambit b2 with 5.Be3, but straightforward development followed by pushing Harry works fine: 5.Nf3 d6 6.h4!? takes us back into a line we considered in B1 and here 6.Bc4!? is also quite tempting, eyeing f7 and looking to get in a quick e5.4...b5?! feels a little strange (...a6 would surely be better preparation for such an advance), and can be met simply by 5.Nf3 and if 5...b4 6.Na4 Qa5 7.c4 with a pleasant edge. There's also 5.e5!? , freeing e4 for the queen's knight and intending Nf3 and Bf4, as well as quite possibly h4.

**5.e5**

Shutting down the bishop on g7 and seizing the space on offer. Just as in the related position with 4.f4 played instead of 4.Be2, Black now has three main ways to continue on the kingside, of which a Gurgenidze-type approach has been his most common. In all three cases though, White is aided by his flexibility: we may still go f4 and Nf3, but h4 and even simply h3 and Nf3 may pose more of a challenge.

**5...h5**

The Gurgenidze-type approach. Black hopes that we'll go 6.f4 Nh6 7.Nf3 Bg4 when he has quite easy play and decent control of the kingside.

**6.h3**

Preventing ...Bg4. White is now set to complete development with the calm Nf3 and O-O, thereby obtaining a good version of an Advance Caro-Kann, with Black having done some slightly strange things on the kingside.

**6...Nh6 7.Nf3**

Once again, sensible, straightforward development is the order of the day. White has sometimes been tempted by 7.g4 , but matters are then far from clear following 7...c5! .

**7...Nf5**

Black hopes that the knight will prove less of a potential target than a bishop on this square, but if anything, he now finds himself even more cramped and low on counterplay.

**8.Bf4**

Overprotecting in anticipation of ...f6. There's also absolutely nothing wrong with 8.O-O followed by Re1.

**8...e6 9.O-O Nd7 10.Bd3**

White hints at a timely exchange on f5 while freeing e2 for his other pieces.

**10...Bf8 11.Ne2**

Thi@ cleared the way for ...c5 to be met by c3 (an earlier ...c5 would have walked into Nb5), leaving White clearly for choice in Boros-Bodo, Hungarian League 1995. He was now ready to go not only Qd2, but also Bg5. White might well then follow up with Bxf5 gxf5; Nf4, leaving a certain h-pawn as a target, as well as Black rather passive and badly behind in the development and counterplay stakes.

### (139) Modern B2: 3...c6 - B2: 3...c6 #2 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c6**

**4.Be2**

**4...d5**

**5.e5**

**5...h5**

**6.h3**

**6...Nh6 7.Nf3**

**7...Nf5**

**8.Bf4**

**8...f6**

would be a more active try, if still pretty good for White after

**9.Bd3**

Now ...Nd7 will run into Bxf5, White is simply set to complete development with Qe2 and O-O-O, and there's no reason to fear a kingside expansion:

**9...g5 10.Bd2 g4**

Black is lured forwards, but otherwise White would just go Qe2 and O-O-O with a large advantage.

**11.hxg4 hxg4 12.Rxh8+ Bxh8 13.Ng5**

A crushing piece sacrifice to open up the queen's path to the kingside:

**13...fxg5**

or 13...Nxd4 14.Bg6+ Kf8 15.Nf7

**14.Qxg4 e6**

14...Ng7 tries to save both pieces, but Black is a goner after 15.Bg6+ Kf8 16.Qf3+ .

**15.Bxg5 Ne7 16.O-O-O**

There's simply no defense for Black as White calmly crashes through with Rh1-h7.

### (140) Modern B2: 3...c6 - B2: 3...c6 #3 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c6**

**4.Be2**

**4...d5**

**5.e5**

**5...h5**

**6.h3**

**6...Bf5**

develops Black's bishop outside the pawn chain, but he must then take care that it doesn't simply become a target on f5:

**7.Nf3 Nd7 8.O-O**

Simple chess from White, who may now aim to bag the bishop-pair with Nh4 or simply improve his pieces with Re1 and Bd3. All the while White is waiting for ...e6 when Bg5 will again begin to exploit Black's weaknesses. For example,

**8...e6 9.Re1 Nh6 10.Bg5**

If Black now moves his queen, White will go Qd2, but neither is

**10...f6 11.exf6 Bxf6**

remotely a panacea for Black on account of a strong, if perhaps slightly unstereotyped exchange:

**12.Bxh6 Rxh6 13.Bd3**

This simply deprives Black of the bishop-pair and leaves him riddled with weakness on e6, e5, g5 and g6.

### (141) Modern B2: 3...c6 - B2: 3...c6 #4 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c6**

**4.Be2**

**4...d5**

**5.e5**

**5...h5**

**6.h3**

**6...Bf5**

**7.Nf3 Nd7 8.O-O**

**8...Bh6 9.Re1 Bxc1 10.Qxc1 e6 11.Bf1**

when White has a very pleasant edge. He may regroup with Ne2, both bringing the knight over to the kingside and freeing the queenside pawns to advance. Note too how if Black ever goes ...h4, he is likely to become tied down to that advanced pawn.

### (142) Modern B2: 3...c6 - B2: 3...c6 #5 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c6**

**4.Be2**

**4...d5**

**5.e5**

**5...h5**

**6.h3**

**6...Bf5**

**7.Nf3 e6 8.Bg5**

rather exploits the dark-square holes that Black has created:

**8...Qb6 9.Qd2**

An important point. White is now ready to begin to take over with O-O-O and Nh4, and the b-pawn is taboo:

**9...Qxb2 10.Rb1 Qa3**

10...Qxc2? 11.Qe3! simply leaves Black's queen trapped and O-O followed by Rfc1 imminent.

**11.Rxb7 Nd7 12.O-O**

Black's position is a complete wreck, with neither king nor queen especially happy, while White is all set to go Rfb1 and/or Rc7.

### (143) Modern B2: 3...c6 - B2: 3...c6 #6 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c6**

**4.Be2**

**4...d5**

**5.e5**

**5...Nh6**

rather asks for...yes, you guessed it, Harry:

**6.h4**

Suddenly the spectre of h5 looms and Black really must try to break out:

**6...f6 7.h5**

Gambiting e5 and few defenders will be entirely comfortable facing such a quick and dangerous-looking assault. Black can now keep lines closed, but only at some positional cost:

**7...fxe5 8.dxe5**

is probably critical, even though Black cannot, of course, touch the e-pawn just yet. Not only can White target g6, but he is all set to go Nf3, Bf4 and Qd2, so Black probably has to counter against e5:

**8...Nd7 9.hxg6**

Exchanging keeps things simple and avoids any notion of 9.f4 g5!? .

**9...hxg6 10.f4**

The position is already quite unbalanced, and a little unusual. However, White should be slightly for choice, due to the target on g6 and because he has the easier moves, not least with Nf3 and Bd3 being the immediate plan. For example, 10...Qb6, 10...Nf5? 11.Rxh8+ Bxh8 12.Nf3 merely helps White with Bd3 and especially g4 on the way. 11.Nf3 Nc5 Now 12.Be3 would allow 12...Qxb2! , but 12.a4! intending a5 Qc7; Be3 12...a5 13.Be3! works. Let's see why: 13...Qxb2, 13...Nf5 14.Rxh8+ Bxh8 15.Bxc5 Qxc5 when 16.Qd3 is one good move, 16.Bd3! another. This frees e2 for the knight should Black check on e3 and simply intends Qd2 followed by g4, with 16...Qb4? 17.Qd2! Qxb2? 18.Rb1 Qa3 19.g4 already pretty much decisive as g6 falls. 14.Bd4! Nf5 15.Rxh8+ Bxh8 16.Rb1 Qa3 Had the a-pawns not advanced, Black's queen would be on a safe path back to a5, but now she is stuck behind enemy lines. White can't win her immediately, but can maintain the initiative: 17.Bd3! Bg7 18.Qd2 White is now set to go Bf2 and g4, so Black might well exchange, but even then he remains under pressure: 18...Nxd3+ 19.Qxd3 Nxd4 20.Nxd4 Kf7 21.Kf2!? Calm play from White, but we hope you've observed how he has continued to frustrate both Black's bishops. Finally, g4 may now follow (and if ...Bxg4 then Rg1) , or even Rb3 Qc5; Nce2 followed by swinging the queen across to the kingside. In both cases, we agree with the engines that White has promising compensation and in practice Black would face no easy task trying to hold his position together and find a plan.<level start="10...Nf5"/><add start="14.Bd4" value="13...Qxb2"/>

### (144) Modern B2: 3...c6 - B2: 3...c6 #7 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c6**

**4.Be2**

**4...d5**

**5.e5**

**5...Nh6**

**6.h4**

**6...f6 7.h5**

**7...fxe5 8.dxe5**

**8...Qb6**

is also a little disruptive, angling for 9.Nf3? Ng4 , but White has a strong and direct reaction:

**9.Na4 Qa5+ 10.c3**

He is now ready to exchange on g6 and go f4, while even b4 may prove useful:

**10...Nd7 11.hxg6 hxg6 12.f4**

12...b5 13.Nc5 is the key point, making good use of a fork. After, say, 13...Nxc5 14.b4 Qc7 15.bxc5 White is just doing pretty well, having by far the most useful pawn advance in g4 available and simply intending Nf3-d4.

### (145) Modern B2: 3...c6 - B2: 3...c6 #8 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c6**

**4.Be2**

**4...d5**

**5.e5**

**5...Nh6**

**6.h4**

**6...f6 7.h5**

**7...Be6 8.Nh3**

threatens to land on f4.

**8...g5**

was similar to 7...g5 in Dogge-Lorscheid, Hoogeveen 2003, where White continued:

**9.g4 Qd7 10.f4**

This brave and strong advance is the point of White's play. Yes, g4 is falling, but Black's kingside is also collapsing:

**10...Nxg4**

10...Bxg4 11.fxg5 Bxh3 12.gxh6 Bf8 13.Bf4 also turns out pretty well for White, with Qd2 and O-O-O on their way, and even 10...gxf4 11.exf6 is promising, in view of 11...exf6 or 11...Bxf6 12.g5 Bxh3 13.gxf6 Qf5! 14.Qd2! followed by Qxf4, which will still maintain the initiative 12.Bxf4 Nxg4 13.Rg1; the pressure down the g-file may not look too hard to deal with, but look deeper and you'll see that there just isn't a great continuation for Black, as shown by 13...f5 14.Qd2 followed by O-O-O and Ng5 with very strong pressure on the light squares and kingside.<add start="13...f5" value="10...Bxg4 11.fxg5 Bxh3 12.gxh6 Bf8 13.Bf4"/>

**11.fxg5 fxe5 12.h6**

drove Black back in disarray in the game 12...Bf8 and now 13.dxe5 would have been strong, followed by Nf4 or 13...Nxe5 14.Qd4! Nf7 15.Bh5 Rg8 16.Rf1 leaving Black rather bound hand and foot.

### (146) Modern B2: 3...c6 - B2: 3...c6 #9 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c6**

**4.Be2**

**4...d5**

**5.e5**

**5...Nh6**

**6.h4**

**6...f6 7.h5**

**7...g5 8.f4 g4**

8...gxf4 is again well met by an intermediary exchange: 9.exf6 Bxf6 10.Bxf4 followed by Nf3, Qd2 and O-O-O.

**9.Bd3**

White makes it hard for Black to settle his bishop on f5 and can be quite happy with his early gain of space. We'll see how this edge might play out in Tomczak-Heberla, Katowice 2019.

### (147) Modern B2: 3...c6 - B2: 3...c6 #10 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c6**

**4.Be2**

**4...d5**

**5.e5**

**5...f6**

has been tried by the majority of grandmasters who have defended this position. With e5 under threat now is the time to maintain White's proud pawn centre:

**6.f4 Nh6**

Even 7.g4!? comes into consideration here, as played by Dave Smerdon and Bragi Thorfinnsson, and White has done well enough with 7.Nf3 Bg4 8.Be3 , but it's also possible to deny Black easy development with

**7.Be3**

White doesn't need to rush to follow up with Nf3 and may well castle long:

**7...O-O**

7...Bf5? 8.g4 simply annexes some very useful space, after which White will complete development following a bishop retreat with h3, Qd2, Nf3 and O-O-O. 7...Nf5 8.Bf2 reveals one important point behind our set-up. 8...fxe5 leaves White with a pleasant choice between 9.fxe5, and if 9...c5 10.dxc5 and 9.dxe5!? , claiming a kingside majority and simply intending to expand with Nf3 and g4, with a very pleasant and aggressive set-up.

**8.Qd2**

Continuing to hold back on Nf3 and hoping to lure Black into aiming for an exchange of bishops.

**8...Bg4 9.f5**

reveals the downside to Black's attempts to trade off his problematic light-squared bishop. The simple threat is Bxh6 and Black is already in some trouble:

**9...Bxe2 10.Bxh6 Bh5 11.Nh3**

would have left Black in huge trouble. Nf4 is threatened and Black can't close the kingside: 11...g5? 12.Bxg7 Kxg7 13.Nxg5! when White will regain his piece with significant interest. And if 11...fxe5 12.Bxg7 Kxg7 then 13.Ng5! is White's other key point, graphically exploiting the glaring weakness of e6.

### (148) Modern B2: 3...c6 - B2: 3...c6 #11 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c6**

**4.Be2**

**4...d5**

**5.e5**

**5...f6**

**6.f4 Nh6**

**7.Be3**

**7...O-O**

**8.Qd2**

**8...Bg4 9.f5**

**9...Nxf5 10.Bxg4 Nxe3 11.Qxe3 fxe5 12.Nce2**

doesn't leave Black with anything like enough for a piece with Nf3 and even h4 on their way, not to mention a certain hole to exploit on e6.

### (149) Modern B2: 3...c6 - B2: 3...c6 #12 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c6**

**4.Be2**

**5...f6**

**6.f4 Nh6**

**7.Be3**

**7...O-O**

**8.Qd2**

**8...Nf5 9.Bf2 Qb6 10.Na4**

is more of the same and after

**10...Qc7 11.Nf3 fxe5 12.fxe5**

12.dxe5!? followed by g4 and h3 might be even stronger

**12...Nd7 13.g4 Nh6 14.h3**

White was all set to leap forwards with Ng5 and was doing pretty well in Morozevich-Iordachescu, Zagan 1997.

### (150) Modern B2: 3...c6 - B2: 3...c6 #13 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c6**

**4.Be2**

**4...d5**

**5.e5**

**5...f6**

**6.f4 Nh6**

**7.Be3**

**7...O-O**

**8.Qd2**

**8...Ng4 9.Bxg4 Bxg4 10.h3**

is @lso welcome news for White, with Nf3 and g4 on the way (or Nge2 if you prefer to meet ...fxe5 with fxe5, not dxe5).

### (151) Modern B2: 3...c6 - B2: 3...c6 #14 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c6**

**4.Be2**

**4...d5**

**5.e5**

**5...f6**

**6.f4 Nh6**

**7.Be3**

**7...O-O**

**8.Qd2**

**8...fxe5**

also leaves White with a pleasant choice according to taste. 9.fxe5 Nf5 10.Nf3! Nxe3 11.Qxe3 leaves White in control and

**9.dxe5**

simply intends h3 and g4. Black can try to disrupt, but

**9...g5**

would have backfired in Skripchenko-Krasenkow, Wijk aan Zee 2002, had White now gone

**10.Nf3 gxf4**

or 10...g4 11.Ng5 followed by h3, Bd3 and O-O-O in some order.

**11.Bxf4 Nf7 12.O-O-O**

followed by h4 or

**12...Bg4 13.Nd4**

when e5 is indirectly protected, leaving White in full control and with much the safer king.

### (152) Modern B2: 3...c6 - B2: 3...c6 #15 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c6**

**4.Be2**

**4...d5**

**5.e5**

**5...f6**

**6.f4 Nh6**

**7.Be3**

**7...Qb6**

attempts to disrupt, but can be met well enough in standard fashion for this variation:

**8.Na4 Qa5+ 9.c3**

White will now seize yet more space with b4 and Black may run a little low on oxygen:

**9...Nd7 10.b4 Qc7 11.Nf3**

simply intends to castle. White will meet ...b5 with Nc5 and

**11...a5**

should also not be feared:

**12.b5 O-O**

was Motylev-Iordachescu, Bucharest 1998, where

**13.O-O Nb6 14.bxc6**

would have retained control over the position, as with

**14...Qxc6 15.Nxb6 Qxb6 16.h3**

when g4 would be far from ridiculous, but White is more likely to be eyeing up the c4 break to activate his bishops. 16...Qc6 17.Rc1 b5 does put the kibosh on that plan, but after 18.g4 White's kingside prospects are quite real. One direct plan would be Qd2 and f5, while Ne1-d3 might also prove quite useful, eyeing a certain hole on c5.

### (153) Modern B2: 3...c6 - B2: 3...c6 #16 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c6**

**4.Be2**

**4...d5**

**5.e5**

**5...f6**

**6.f4 Nh6**

**7.Be3**

**7...Nd7 8.Qd2 Nb6 9.h3 Be6**

was the course of Sax-Qendro, Bratto 2005, where there was no need for 10.b3 Instead,

**10.g4**

is thematic and effective, refusing to fear an invasion on c4:

**10...Nc4 11.Bxc4 dxc4 12.Nf3**

threatens f5 and after 12...f5 13.Ng5! Bd5 14.Nxd5 Qxd5 15.Rg1 White will be quick to challenge Black's light-squared grip with Qg2 and/or b3, and do note how his knight can skip into e6 if the queens come off.

### (154) Modern B2: 3...c6 - B2: 3...c6 #17 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c6**

**4.Be2**

**4...d5**

**5.e5**

It should be said that Black probably does have to react as we've seen on the kingside, especially as

**5...c5 6.dxc5**

is premature. The centre opens when only White is ready, and if

**6...d4**

or 6...e6? 7.Nb5!

**7.Nb5 Nc6 8.Nf3**

which will maintain an extra pawn.

### (155) Modern B3: 3...c5 - B3: 3...c5 #1 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5**

The so-called Sniper, as popularised in the UK by the enthusiastic Geordie FM Charlie Storey about 10 years ago and earlier in the US by IM Ron Henley. Black's immediate central break feels like it should coordinate well with his early fianchetto, but it just doesn't work out like that in practice, especially when White simply takes the pawn.

**4.dxc5**

Our favourite option in such positions and a strong one here, since Black must lose time if he wants to regain his pawn.

**4...Qa5**

Black's most popular choice, pressuring c5 and c3. It's easy to criticize when you see how easily White now obtains the initiative, but finding a superior option for Black isn't so easy. 4...Na6?! 5.Bxa6 bxa6 6.Nge2 is also excellent for White followed by f3 and Be3, as is 4...Nf6? 5.e5 .

**5.Bd2**

Covering c3 and menacing Nd5.

**5...Qxc5 6.Nd5**

A strong way to seize the initiative and already a dream position for White. Can you spot the immediate threat? Well, it's 7.Bb4 Qc6 8.Bb5! , winning serious material.<addx start="7.Bb4"/>

**6...Na6**

To cover c7. Black has been known to fall for the trap and even his queen-saving alternatives aren't all that hot.

**7.Nf3**

Not White's only good move, but a simple and strong one. The immediate threat is 8.b4 Qd6 9.Bf4 and unsurprisingly White has scored over 75% from here.<addx start="8.b4"/>

**7...e6**

Black usually tries this.

**8.Be3**

Also rather promising are 8.Bc3 when Black usually goes 8...Kf8 and 8.b4!? Qf8 9.Ne3 .

**8...Qa5+ 9.Nc3**

To our surprise this position is yet to be reached in practice, but we would be very happy as White. The immediate idea is to further weaken Black on the dark squares with Bd4 and not only is Black vulnerable on the kingside, but also d6.

**9...Nf6 10.Nd2**

Slightly retrograde perhaps, but this prevents both ...Nxe4 and ...Ng4 and already carries a threat: Nc4 followed by Nd6+ and/or e5.

**10...d5 11.Nb3**

Simple chess. If you'd prefer a promising version of a French for White then 11.e5 Nd7 12.Nb3 followed by f4, Qd2 and O-O-O might be preferred.

**11...Qd8 12.Bxa6**

Yet again we find White more than happy to develop with tempo.

**12...bxa6 13.exd5**

With Black lacking a great way to recapture, White can be very happy with how the opening has gone. White is set to go short and/or cause trouble with Bc5.

**13...O-O 14.d6 Bb7 15.O-O**

Black surely doesn't have enough for a pawn here, with White set to go Qd2 and Rad1, or if 15...Nd5 16.Nxd5 Bxd5 17.Qd3! This threatens c4, also eyes a6 and allows White to consider augmenting his dark-square grip with a timely f4 (such as after ...Qh4) . There's also a very strong exchange sacrifice potentially coming up: 17...Bxb2 18.c4! Bxa1 19.Rxa1 Bc6 20.Rd1 White has far, far too much for the exchange with Na5 on its way to help the connected central passed pawns, which surely Black won't be able to halt as well as defend his rather vulnerable king.

### (156) Modern B3: 3...c5 - B3: 3...c5 #2 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Qa5**

**5.Bd2**

**5...Qxc5 6.Nd5**

**6...Na6**

**7.Nf3**

**7...e6**

**8.Be3**

**8...Qa5+ 9.Nc3**

**9...Nf6 10.Nd2**

**10...d5 11.Nb3**

**11...Qd8 12.Bxa6**

**12...bxa6 13.exd5**

**13...Nxd5**

13...exd5? 14.Bc5 is even worse, badly disrupting Black's attempt to complete development.

**14.Nxd5 Qxd5 15.Qxd5 exd5 16.Bd4**

would be something of a positional disaster for Black, with White's knight set to take up an ideal blockading post on d4.

### (157) Modern B3: 3...c5 - B3: 3...c5 #3 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Qa5**

**5.Bd2**

**5...Qxc5 6.Nd5**

**6...Na6**

**7.Nf3**

**7...e6**

**8.Be3**

**8...Qa5+ 9.Nc3**

**9...Bxc3+ 10.bxc3 Qxc3+**

does grab a pawn, but only at the cost of weakening Black's already lose hold on the dark squares:

**11.Bd2 Qc6**

or 11...Qc7 12.Bxa6 bxa6 13.Bb4 .

**12.Bxa6 Qxa6 13.Bb4**

Neither side can castle, but Black's king is surely in the greater trouble. White will likely wait for Black to move his queen or go ...b6 before landing a strong blow with Qd6, while the immediate threat is Qd4 followed by f6; e5 f5; c4, further weakening Black's structure ahead of castling kingside.

### (158) Modern B3: 3...c5 - B3: 3...c5 #4 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Qa5**

**5.Bd2**

**5...Qxc5 6.Nd5**

**6...Na6**

**7.Nf3**

**7...Bxb2 8.Rb1**

once again can't be recommended for Black, with White set to complete development a tempo:

**8...Bg7 9.Bxa6 bxa6 10.O-O**

Talk about a lead in development! The immediate threat is 11.Bb4 Qc6 12.Ba5 and it's almost impossible to find even a half decent move for Black.<addx start="11.Bb4"/>

### (159) Modern B3: 3...c5 - B3: 3...c5 #5 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Qa5**

**5.Bd2**

**5...Qxc5 6.Nd5**

**6...Na6**

**7.Nf3**

**7...Nf6**

presumably misses the threat

**8.b4 Qd6 9.Bf4 Qe6**

Here White can simply carry on attacking with tempo

**10.Ng5 Qc6**

but now 11.b5 Qc5 actually isn't so clear. However, White has a huge advantage if you know just one more move

**11.Be5**

This contests the key diagonal and leaves Black without a good way to meet 12.b5 Qc5 13.Be3.<add start="12.b5" value="11.XX XX"/>

### (160) Modern B3: 3...c5 - B3: 3...c5 #6 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Qa5**

**5.Bd2**

**5...Qxc5 6.Nd5**

**6...Bxb2**

hopes for 7.Bb4? Qd4 , but loses to

**7.Rb1 Be5**

or 7...Ba3 8.Rb3 followed by Rc3 or Qa1 with huge pressure, as occurs too following 7...Bd4 8.Bb4! Bxf2+ 9.Ke2 Qd4 10.Bc3 .

**8.Nf3 Bc7 9.Bb4 Ba5 10.c3**

and there's just no good move for Black.

### (161) Modern B3: 3...c5 - B3: 3...c5 #7 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Qa5**

**5.Bd2**

**5...Qxc5 6.Nd5**

**6...Bxb2**

**7.Rb1 Be5**

**8.Nf3 Bd6 9.Rb5 Qc6 10.Nd4 Qa6 11.Ra5**

finally traps the queen

### (162) Modern B3: 3...c5 - B3: 3...c5 #8 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Qa5**

**5.Bd2**

**5...Qxc5 6.Nd5**

**6...b6 7.Bb4 Qc6 8.Bb5 Qb7**

keeps the queen safe, but surely at too large a cost in terms of development and time. Now the engines quite like 9.Qf3!? and

**9.Nf3 Nc6 10.Bc3**

simply left White clearly better in Wells-Dougherty, Hoogeveen 2005:

**10...Bxc3+ 11.Nxc3**

will be followed by Qd2 and O-O-O, with Bc4 and an assault on f7 very much an idea too.

### (163) Modern B3: 3...c5 - B3: 3...c5 #9 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Bxc3+ 5.bxc3**

is the other critical line, but while White's c-pawns may not be easy on the eye, he does control the dark squares. Moreover, White hasn't given up on obtaining the initiative and even Qd4 may become a strong possibility:

**5...Qa5 6.Qd4 Nf6 7.Qb4**

Not our usual approach, but a strong offer to exchange queens. White would be delighted to do so, even at the cost of e4, leaving him with the two bishops and full control. Black might instead decline the swap, but remains clearly worse in any case:

**7...Qc7 8.Bd3**

Again, we see this method of development from White, simply intending Ne2, O-O and Bf4. Black can either kick the queen or try to break out

**8...Nc6 9.Qa4**

The@safest square for the queen and one which avoids the option of 9.Qa3 Nxe4!?. White is now ready to go Ne2 and Be3 or Bf4 and it's far from clear how Black can obtain any compensation. For example: 9...e5 10.a3 b6! 11.cxb6 O-O 12.Nf3 Qb8 13.b7!? was an easy method to maintain control in Sharapov-Skalski, Wroclaw 2007, where 13...Bxb7 14.Rb1 Qc7 15.O-O d6 16.c4 facilitated Qc3 and Bh6, as well as c5 and was just an extra pawn for White.<level start="9.Qa3"/>

### (164) Modern B3: 3...c5 - B3: 3...c5 #10 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Bxc3+ 5.bxc3**

**5...Qa5 6.Qd4 Nf6 7.Qb4**

**7...Qc7 8.Bd3**

**8...b6 9.cxb6 axb6 10.Be3**

wasted no time in revealing the downside to Black's approach in Pashikian-Istratescu, European Championship, Antalya 2004, where

**10...Na6 11.Bxb6 Qc6 12.Qd4 d6 13.Nf3**

Followed by e5 or 13...Nc5 14.Bxc5 dxc5 15.Qe5 with two extra pawns, and if 15...c4 16.Nd4 .

### (165) Modern B3: 3...c5 - B3: 3...c5 #11 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Bxc3+ 5.bxc3**

**5...Qa5 6.Qd4 Nf6 7.Qb4**

**7...Qxb4 8.cxb4 Nxe4 9.Bb2 O-O 10.Bd3**

is excellent for White with two such raking bishops, not to mention ideas of Ne2, f3, g4 and h4, suddenly launching a powerful assault.

### (166) Modern B3: 3...c5 - B3: 3...c5 #12 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Bxc3+ 5.bxc3**

**5...Qa5 6.Qd4 Nf6 7.Qb4**

**7...Nc6 8.Qxa5 Nxa5**

was the line Storey tried to make work for Black, but even after a ...b6 gambit he is just somewhat worse:

**9.Bd3 O-O 10.Ne2**

is not White's only good approach, but is a simple one, developing the kingside while keeping the dark-squared bishop's options open. After

**10...b6 11.cxb6 axb6 12.Bg5**

White is surely just doing pretty well with Rb1 set to demonstrate that Black too has a clear target on the queenside.

### (167) Modern B3: 3...c5 - B3: 3...c5 #13 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Bxc3+ 5.bxc3**

**5...Nf6**

could be a better practical try, but not if White is well prepared:

**6.e5 Ne4**

Now Richard once went 7.Qd5 , but

**7.Bc4**

is even stronger, with the threat of Qd5:

**7...Nxc5**

Or 7...Qa5 8.Ne2 when White is ready to go Qd5 or Qd4 should Black take with the queen. He also has 8...Nxc5 9.Qd5 e6 10.Qf3 Nc6 , but this is simply excellent for White after 11.O-O . Just look at those dark squares! One idea is clearly Qf6, another Nd4, and, if allowed, Nb5.

**8.Qd5**

Consistent and forcing the pace. White has also scored well with 8.Nf3 followed by O-O and Bh6.

**8...Ne6**

This was A.C.Taylor-Storey, British Championship, Torquay 2019, where

**9.Nf3 Nc6 10.O-O**

wou@d have left White in control. One idea is Qe4 followed by Bd5, after which Re1 may leave Black struggling to free his position. White may then even be able to attack e7 with Qh4 and Ba3 (possibly after a4) or Bg5, all the while hoping that Black will castle into a surely fatal attack on the kingside.

### (168) Modern B3: 3...c5 - B3: 3...c5 #14 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5**

**4.dxc5**

**4...Bxc3+ 5.bxc3**

**5...Nc6 6.Be3 Qa5 7.Qd2**

maintains control and the extra pawn with simple moves. Black can try to castle, but even doing so is far from a panacea for him:

**7...Nf6 8.f3 O-O**

Here 9.h4 b6! gives Black some much needed counterplay, but White is doing very well after 9.Ne2 and Nd4 or

**9.c4 Qa3 10.Ne2**

followed by Qc3, as in Drake Diez De Rivera-Bocanegra Moreno, correspondence 2003.

### (169) Modern B3: 3...c5 - B3: 3...c5 #15 

**1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5**

**4.dxc5**

Other moves are rare for Black and easy to meet, as shown by

**4...Nc6 5.Be3**

followed by Qd2 or

**5...Nf6 6.f3 O-O 7.Qd2**

which just left White with an excellent version of a Dragon in Prizant-Sigurjonsson, correspondence 1988, where Harry even managed to get in on the action:

**7...Qa5 8.Bd3 Ne8**

8...b6!? 9.cxb6 axb6 10.Nge2 followed by O-O would have restricted White to a clear plus.

**9.Nge2 d6 10.Nc1 f5 11.Nb3**

11...Bxc3 12.bxc3 Qc7 13.h4! and Black didn't last too much longer on the kingside
