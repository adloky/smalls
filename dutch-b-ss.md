## Wojtaszek, R. vs. Williams, S. 0-1

My opponent rated 2721 at the time and the second of the World Champion, Vishy Anand, succumbed to the power of the Classical Dutch!

**1.d4 f5**

For training purposes we've changed the beginning move order, which was 1...e6 2.Nf3 f5

**2.Nf3 e6 3.g3 Nf6 4.Bg2 Be7 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6**

The main line of the Classical Dutch and a position that we will concentrate on in the larger course as you are very likely to get into this position.

**7.Qc2**

Not a great square for the Queen unless White can play e4.

**7...a5 8.Nc3 Nc6**

A very nice position for Black. ...e5 is coming. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ...e5 IS THE MAIN IDEA FOR BLACK IN THE CLASSICAL DUTCH!!!!

**9.b3 e5 10.dxe5 dxe5 11.Rd1 Qe8**

Another manoeuvre that you should know. The queen moves over to h5, where it starts an attack against White's Kingside.

**12.Nb5**

Hitting c7 but who cares about pawns!?

**12...Qh5!?**

Played in the spirit of a drunk 17th century coffee house player! 12...Bd8 is safe with a perfectly fine position, but safe is boring right?

**13.Nxc7 f4**

Everything aims at White's King. Whilst White may be able to defend with the upmost correct play this kind of attack is certainly not pleasant to face. Who cares about Rooks right?

**14.Nxa8 Bc5**

Increasing the pressure against f2.

**15.Rd5??**

This turns out to be the losing move.

I spent so much time looking at 15.Nc7?! bringing the knight back into play, that I failed to find White's best line. Taking a further look at this move (which I gave as leading to a draw in the June update) I have found some additional resources for both players: 15...Nb4 16.Qb2?!

after 16.Qc3 Bxf2+! 17.Kf1 fxg3 18.Qxe5 Qxe5 19.Nxe5 Ng4 Black has good compensation<level/>

16...Ng4 17.Nd5 Bxf2+!

Not 17...Nxf2? as 18.Be3! kills off the attack, and following 18...Nxd1 19.Rxd1 fxe3 20.Qxe5 Qxe5 21.Nxe5 Nxa2 22.Ra1 Nb4 23.Rxa5 White has good winning chances<level/>

18.Kf1 Nxd5 19.h3!

19.Rxd5? fxg3 20.hxg3 Bxg3 21.Kg1 Bf2+ 22.Kf1 and now the attack after 22...Qh4!! seems too strong<level/>

19...Nde3+ 20.Bxe3 Nxe3+ 21.Kxf2 Nxg2 22.Kxg2 Qxh3+ 23.Kg1 e4! with adequate compensation.

White has in fact to play 15.gxf4 ! (as pointed out and analyzed by Denis Monokroussos. The lines that follow are based largely on his work) After 15...Bf5

Black lacks ammunition after 15...e4 16.Ng5 Bf5 17.Qc3 Ng4 18.Nh3<level/>

16.e4

there may be more than one way to obtain an advantage: 16.Qb2!? Rxa8<level/>

16...Ng4 17.e3 Nxh2 18.Nxh2 Qxd1+ 19.Nf1<level value="+2"/>

17.Be3 Bxe3 18.fxe3 Ng4 19.Qc3 e4 20.h3 Nf6 21.Nd4 Bxh3 22.Qe1 Nxd4 23.Rxd4 Bxg2 24.Kxg2 Ra6 25.f5! and White seems to be on top<level/>

16...Bxe4 17.Qe2 Rxa8 18.Bb2 Bf5 19.Bxe5

or possibly 19.fxe5!? Ng4 20.Kf1<level/>

19...Ng4 20.Rd5! with advantage. Naturally one can further analyze these variations to determine exactly how big is White's plus, but it seems evident that 15. gxf4 is a good antidote. So 12...Qh5 seems to be unsound, in theory, but of course those who like to gamble may still be tempted...

**15...Nb4**

Now Black is just better.

**16.Rxe5**

If 16.Qb1, then 16...Nbxd5

16...Bf5? 17.Rxe5<level/>

17.cxd5 Bf5 18.Qb2 Ng4 19.e3 Be4 gives Black a vicious attack.

**16...Nxc2 17.Rxh5 Nxh5 18.Rb1 fxg3 19.hxg3 Nxg3! 20.Rb2 Bf5**

Well I enjoyed that game...

A similar game that I had with the White pieces went... 1.f4 d5 2.Nf3 g6 3.e3 Bg7 4.Be2 c5 5.O-O Nc6 6.d3 Nf6 7.a4 O-O 8.Kh1 The only main difference between this and the main game is that my king is placed on h1. Occasionally, I play 1\.f4, it is not such a bad move. Will you be tempted by the end of this course !? 8...Qc7 9.Nc3 a6 10.e4 dxe4 11.dxe4 Rd8 12.Qe1 Nd4 13.Bd1 would now be the 'sensible' move but I am not known for my sensibilities. 13.Bc4!? as in the main game 13...Nxc2 14.Qh4 Nxa1?

14...Rd4 would have been much stronger.<level/>

15.f5 b5!? 16.axb5 axb5 17.Nxb5 Qb7 18.Ng5 e6 19.Nxh7 with a dangerous attack. 19...Nxh7 20.Qxd8+ Nf8 21.Qh4 f6 22.e5 Black's position goes downhill quickly. 22...g5 23.Qg4 Qe7 24.Bxg5 fxg5 25.f6 Qf7 26.Bd3 Bxf6 27.exf6 Nh7 28.Nd6 Qd7 29.f7+ Kf8 30.Bxh7 1-0 (30) Williams,S-Yuan Zhong Zhao 2: World Under-20 Championship 1999

## The Classical Dutch: Main line 8. Qc2 Nxc3 9. bxc3 #1

**1.d4 f5**

This is the move order that we concentrate on in the larger course, but 1...e6 maybe of interest to French Defence players (like myself) as you avoid a number of second move alternatives that White can play. Such as 2 Bg5 and the Staunton Gambit. The issue though is that you should only play

1...e6 if you do play the French Defence, as after 2.e4 you can no longer enter into a dutch Defence. If that is not the case then always play 1...f5 and ignore this move order in the future.

**2.Nf3 e6 3.g3 Nf6 4.Bg2**

This is it, the main line. White's Bishop is especially well placed on g2 from where it creates pressure across the whole board.

**4...Be7**

4...d6 may also be possible, but I find ...Be7 first to generally be more flexible.

4...Bb4+!? is an interesting idea that I have used on a number of occasions. The idea is to try and tempt White into playing 5. Bd2?!, but 5.Nbd2! is the critical test. Aiming to gain the Bishop pair hassle free.

**5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6 7.Nc3 Ne4!?**

This is a logical move. White has a space advantage so Black aims to alleviate his position by exchanging pieces with the move ...Ne4. This move also frees the f6-square for Black's dark-squared bishop. I used to think that this was the solution to all of Black's problems. That was until White started to play 8 Nxe4! The latter is the only way that White can aim to gain an advantage, but there is still not enough evidence to suggest that the resulting position is equal or even slightly better for White. The position remains unbalanced and is therefore extremely interesting. 7...Ne4 is an easy line to remember and Black's future plans are relatively straightforward compared with Black's other options on move eight.

7...a5 is a move that I have lost faith in

7...Qe8!? is an alternative, yet White remains better in a couple of ways. 8.b3 Ne4 9.Nxe4⩲ is yet again a problem for Black as we will see later. This is always the move that White should be aiming to play!

7...Nc6?! 8.d5 also seems to lead to a White advantage.

**8.Qc2**

This is, without a doubt, White's most natural move and I am sure that if you play ...Ne4, you will find that a lot of your opponents will respond with Qc2. This move forces Black to make a decision about his knight on e4 and it also helps White to play e4 at a later stage. Nonetheless, Qc2 is not disconcerting and it seems that Black will obtain a good position in most cases.

8.Qd3 has little independent value as the position will normally transpose after 8...Nxc3 9.Qxc3.

**8...Nxc3 9.bxc3**

9.Qxc3 is more logical and common and we will take a short peek later at this move.

**9...Nc6!**

The best move preparing ...e5! In this case we are not as worried about d5 because of White's pawn weaknesses on the c-file.

**10.d5**

This is a very important option. This does leave White very weak on c3 and c4 though.

10.Rd1 is another try by White that is analyzed in the larger course.

**10...Na5!**

Hitting c4.

**11.Qa4**

This defends the pawn on c4 and attacks Black's Knight on a5.

Some alternatives that are considered in the larger course are 11.Nd4

and 11.dxe6.

**11...b6**

The simplest.

**12.dxe6**

Here the main course also considers 12.Nd4 - 4 variations.

**12...Bxe6 13.Nd4 Bxc4 14.Nc6**

14.Bxa8 Qxa8 Black has excellent compensation on the light squares. I would love to get this position as Black! 15.Qd7 and now the move 15...Rf7!∓ which is stronger than my previous suggestion ...Qd8. 16.Qxc7?? Bf8−+

**14...Qd7 15.Nxe7+ Qxe7 16.Bxa8 Rxa8⩱**

Black has great compensation on the light squares.

## The Classical Dutch: Main line 8. Qc2 Nxc3 9. bxc3 #2

**1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 e6 3.g3 Nf6 4.Bg2 Be7 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6 7.Nc3 Ne4 8.Qc2 Nxc3 9.bxc3 Nc6! 10.e4**

White continues with his standard plan.

**10...e5! 11.dxe5**

The larger course also considers 11.d5, which however cannot be critical - closing the centre can only benefit Black, as now White will always have extremely weak c-pawns.

**11...dxe5**

Black has established his ideal pawn attacking formation - e5 and f5.

**12.Rb1!? f4**

If Black can play this move in the classical Dutch he should do so!

**13.Rb5 Qd6! 14.Rd1 Qf6**

After 15.gxf4 exf4 16.e5 Qh6 =+ Black is doing fine.

## The Classical Dutch: Main line 8. Qc2 Nxc3 9. Qxc3 #1

**1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 e6 3.g3 Nf6 4.Bg2 Be7 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6 7.Nc3 Ne4 8.Qc2 Nxc3 9.Qxc3 a5**

This is my main suggestion and 9...a5 makes a lot of sense. Black stops White from playing b4 and gains space on the Queenside himself. One thing you must be aware of here though is the resulting endgame which comes up.

The endgame should be fine for Black, but if you want to keep more pieces on the board then it may be an idea to take a look at 9...Bf6!?. I want to give you two choices here, which are pretty much equally as good. You must decide going on your own style. A sample line is 10.b4 Nd7 11.Bb2 a5 12.b5 c5 13.Qd2 cxd4 14.Nxd4 Nb6 15.Rac1 e5=

**10.b3**

The most natural move which helps White complete his development. What should Black's plan be? The plan we are about to look at is very important as it appears in several positions and is an idea that you should remember...

In the larger course we also consider 10.a3,

10.Qc2,

and 10.Re1 (12 variations) - here an important and crazy line we consider goes 10...Nc6! 11.e4 e5! 12.exf5 Bxf5 13.dxe5 dxe5 14.c5! Bf6 15.Qb3+ Kh8 16.Qxb7 Nb4! 17.Nxe5 Nc2 18.Bf4! Nxa1 19.Qxa8 Qxa8 20.Bxa8 Nc2 etc.

**10...Bf6! 11.Bb2 Nc6!**

Black is preparing to play ...e5 and there is nothing that White can do to stop it.

**12.Qd2 e5**

12...Qe7 13.d5!

**13.dxe5 dxe5 14.Qd5+**

The Black King is pushed offside which can only help White in the endgame.

**14...Kh8 15.Qxd8 Rxd8 16.Rfd1**

This is a key Endgame. Black must watch out for the following plan: Rfd1, Ne1, Bxc6, Nd3 and then Nc5. I originally studied this position with the Pert twins, who thought that this was a good way for White to obtain a small but safe advantage. In actual fact, this position can be quite dangerous for Black but with accurate play, Black should be doing fine.

**16...Re8!**

This may be the best move. The Rook gives extra protection to the e5-pawn from e8 making it possible to generate quick counterplay on the Queenside with ...a4.

**17.Ne1 a4 18.Bxc6 bxc6**

Black is planning to play 19...Rb8 on his next move and increase the pressure against b3.<addx start="19...Rb8"/>

**19.Nd3 e4! 20.Bxf6 exd3=**

## The Classical Dutch: Main line 8. Qc2 Nxc3 9. Qxc3 #2

**1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 e6 3.g3 Nf6 4.Bg2 Be7 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6 7.Nc3 Ne4 8.Qc2 Nxc3 9.Qxc3 a5 10.b3 Bf6 11.Bb2 Nc6 12.Qd2 e5 13.dxe5 dxe5 14.Qd5+ Kh8 15.Qxd8 Rxd8 16.Rfd1**

is a key Endgame.

**16...Re8! 17.Ne1 a4 18.Bxc6 bxc6 19.f4**

Black is planning to play 19...Rb8 on his next move and increase the pressure against b3, so White has to take action.

**19...exf4! 20.Bxf6 gxf6**

With an equal game. Komodo 12 gives the following line.

**21.gxf4 Rxe2 22.Rd8+ Kg7 23.bxa4 c5!**

Now 24.a5 Kf7 25.Rh8 Kg7 26.Rd8 Kf7 is a possible repetition.

If Black wants to play for more, he could try 24.a5 Bb7!? as going after the c7- or h7-pawn is risky for White - Black is very active.

## The Classical Dutch: Main line 8. Nxe4! fxe4 9. Ne1

**1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 e6 3.g3 Nf6 4.Bg2 Be7 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6 7.Nc3 Ne4 8.Nxe4!**

The main test and the only way that I can find for White to fight for an advantage.

**8...fxe4 9.Ne1**

A move that has been suggested by theoretician Glean Flear. The disadvantage of this line for White is that the Queen on d1 is left exposed, but the advantage is that the Bishop on c1 can move.

We will also take a look at the more popular 9.Nd2.

**9...d5 10.f3**

And now for a newish move

**10...Nc6**

I wanted to suggest this idea for two reasons. 1 It has only been played four times before. 2 It is similar to the line I suggest after 9. Nd2. As far as I can tell this line also offers Black a good game, without getting involved with the complications of 10...dxc4

10...dxc4 is my old main line. Played so that Black can play a quick ...e5 and take advantage of the pin on the pawn on d4. But I will avoid it in the larger course to try and keep things as simple as can be! The main course features 5 variations starting with 10...Nc6.

## The Classical Dutch: Main line 8. Nxe4! fxe4 9. Nd2 and 10. e3

**1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 e6 3.g3 Nf6 4.Bg2 Be7 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6 7.Nc3 Ne4 8.Nxe4 fxe4 9.Nd2 d5 10.e3**

This move is more quiet than the usual 10.f3, though it can transpose, but this move order gives Black an extra option.

**10...Nc6**

Here an interesting alternative I offer is 10...c5!? which is a move that I would probably play to make things more entertaining. 11.dxc5 Nc6!? interesting and dynamic 12.f3 exf3 13.Bxf3 Ne5! All of a sudden Black's pieces become very active!: Hawes, J (2151) (-Bibby,S) (2229) (Mallorca 2004)

**11.f3**

This transposes to the more popular 10. f3 Nc6 11. e3.

## The Classical Dutch: Main line 8. Nxe4! fxe4 9. Nd2 and 10. f3 #1

**1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 e6 3.g3 Nf6 4.Bg2 Be7 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6 7.Nc3 Ne4 8.Nxe4 fxe4 9.Nd2 d5 10.f3**

In the larger course we also look at White's try 10.Nb1!? - rerouting the knight to c3 after which he continues to develop normally - 3 variations.

**10...Nc6 11.e3!?**

is another line which is a bit annoying for Black, as White plays it safe and solid.

**11...exf3 12.Nxf3 b6!**

Safest and the best. Black has some alternatives here in 12...Qd6

and 12...Bf6!?, but neither of them seem to promise Black equality.

**13.b3 Bb7 14.Bb2 Bf6**

In the main course we also consider 14...Qd7 15.Qc2 Rf7, when the position is dull but Black should be equal.

**15.Qe2 Qd6 16.Rad1 a5!**

Now in Korotylev, A. vs. Glek, I., Moscow 2017, White became impatient and played 17.e4?! a bit premature, but how to wait!? 17...dxe4 18.Qxe4 a4 19.Rfe1 axb3∓ 20.axb3 Rfe8 21.Qe3 Ra2 22.Rd2 Rxb2 23.Rxb2 Nxd4 24.Rf2 Nxf3+ 25.Bxf3 Bd4 26.Qf4 Qxf4 27.gxf4 Bxf3 0-1

## The Classical Dutch: Main line 8. Nxe4! fxe4 9. Nd2 and 10. f3 #2

**1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 e6 3.g3 Nf6 4.Bg2 Be7 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6 7.Nc3 Ne4 8.Nxe4 fxe4 9.Nd2 d5 10.f3 Nc6 11.fxe4! Rxf1+**

Now the question is how White retakes on f1, he has tried almost every possible capture and each has its own advantages and drawbacks.

**12.Nxf1**

The most popular, for now, Black is currently ok.

**12...dxc4 13.Be3**

White has a strong centre but the position remains dynamic. Black also has a number of interesting possibilities.

13.e3 e5!⩱

**13...Bd7!**

This is looking fine for Black from a theoretical stand point. This line is examined in more detail in the larger course - 10 variations.

## The Classical Dutch: Main line 8. Nxe4! fxe4 9. Nd2 and 10. f3 #3

**1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 e6 3.g3 Nf6 4.Bg2 Be7 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6 7.Nc3 Ne4 8.Nxe4 fxe4 9.Nd2 d5 10.f3 Nc6 11.fxe4 Rxf1+ 12.Kxf1**

This was originally praised by a number of people on the Chess Publishing forum and now it has become the current trend for White. Originally, I did not believe this idea, as it just looks too odd moving the king to f1 whilst allowing the Knight on d2 quick access to f3. Currently Black has enough ways to play against this to hold equality.

**12...dxc4**

Normally the correct way for Black to continue in this rather complex and obscure variation. By capturing on c4 he creates pressure against White's pawn on d4. White now has two critical continuations 13. Nf3 and 13. e3.

**13.Nf3!**

Discussed on Chess Publishing in length.

I spend 6 variations on 13.e3 in the main course.

**13...b5**

This natural move seems to hold the balance.

**14.Be3**

Now Black has to make a choice between a number of options.

**14...Qe8**

14...a6!? also seems to hold the balance, as in the game Chris Ward vs. Nick Pert, Hull 2018.

**15.d5 Nb4 16.a3 Na6 17.b4**

The computer's top choice.

After 17.a4 the knight can go back: 17...Nb4! - we dig deeper into this position in the main course, 5 variations.

**17...Kh8=**

This move allows Black to play for a win.

An alternative is 17...Bb7 18.Bh3 exd5 19.Be6+ Kh8 20.Ne5 Bf6 21.Nf7+ Kg8 22.exd5 Kf8 23.Ng5 Qg6= - a line of the Perts. After the text Black intends to continue ...Bb7 without having to worry about Bh3-e6+ coming with check.

## The Classical Dutch: early Nh3 line

**1.d4 f5 2.g3 e6 3.Bg2 Nf6 4.Nh3**

This was a move that used to concern me when writting the 'Killer Dutch' but that fear has passed. Nh3 is normally aimed against the Stonewall Dutch set-up. In that set-up, with Black pawns on c6, d5, e6 and f5, White aims to take complete control of the weak e5-square. White does this by playing Nf4-Nd3 and with the other Knight Nd2-Nf3.

But here Black has not played ...d5 yet, so it should be in his favour to play ...d6 and ...e5, limiting the activity of White's Knight on h3 and taking control of the e5-square.

**4...Be7 5.c4 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.b3!**

This looks like the toughest test for Black. We look at this move in some detail during the introductory games of the larger course.

Other tries that we consider in the main course are 7.Nc3 - 4 variations,

7.Qb3 - 3 variations,

and 7.Nf4 - 1 variation.

**7...c6!**

Nearly always a useful move in this variation. Black gives his Queen a chance to move to the c7-square supporting ...e5.

7...e5 8.Bb2 e4 9.Nc3 c6

9...d5 10.cxd5 Nxd5 11.Nxd5 Qxd5 12.f3<level/>

10.d5! This is a good move that gives White an advantage. Black was planning to play ...d5 himself and this move cuts across it, it also opens up the Bishop on b2 and prepares to break down Black's pawn structure on e4 and f5, with the thematic move f3! White is slightly better here.

**8.Bb2**

The main course also considers 8.Nd2.

**8...Qc7!**

is the correct way to handle White's plan. As seen in N.Pert vs R.Pert, 2015, British Championships.

8...Qe8 9.Nd2 a5 Ambartsoumian, A (2424) (-Altounian,L) (2427) Costa Mesa 2003 Allows White to play 10.e4!?⩲

**9.Nd2**

This looks like the most sensible square for White's Knight. The other option was c3 but it does little there, as it no longer has the option of moving into d5.

**9...e5 10.c5**

Very logical. Other options may even allow Black the chance to gain a big pawn centre with the moves ...e4 and ...d5.

In the main course we spend 4 variations looking at 10.e4.

**10...e4!**

This forces White to capture on d6, otherwise Black will play ...d5 on his next move with a great position. After 11.cxd6 Bxd6 12.Nc4 Nd5 Black should be at least equal.

## The Classical Dutch: 7. b4

**1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 e6 3.g3 Nf6 4.Bg2 Be7 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6 7.b4!?**

is like 7. b3 yet having the pawn on b4 has it's downsides. Mainly it is more exposed to attack here, with moves like ...a5 and then after b5 ...c6.

The main course also features some other rare options - 7.Qc2

and 7.Bg5.

**7...a5!**

This is probably strong than 7...Ne4 8.Bb2 and only then 8...a5, as this gives White the extra option 9.a3.

**8.b5 Ne4 9.Bb2 a4!?**

To stop a4 and threaten ...a3 in some positions.

**10.Nfd2**

Aiming to remove the beast on e4.

The larger course also considers 10.a3

and 10.Qc2.

**10...d5**

My simple solution. White's pieces are slightly misplaced and the pawn on b5 is a target, so entering into a Stonewall structure makes sense to me. I think Black is fine here as we explore in the larger course (6 variations) .

## The Classical Dutch: 7. b3

**1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 e6 3.g3 Nf6 4.Bg2 Be7 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6 7.b3!**

A simple and often played move. White wants to give extra control to the e5 square. This move is often seen and I have tried many different things against it. For this course I am suggesting 7...a5!?.

**7...a5**

After doing a lot of research I am coming around to Pinski's (Classical Dutch - 2002) way of thinking. He came to the conclusion that ...Ne4 was only worth playing when White is threatening to go e4! That is what we are aiming at here, we will play a number of useful moves until that is an option.

**8.Bb2**

8.Nc3 (11 variations) stops Black from playing 8...a4. 8...Qe8 9.Qc2 Nc6 Igor Naumkin has great results on the Black side of this variation. 10.e4 Qh5!? is an interesting suggestion of Komodo. The idea is 11.exf5 e5! with great play for Black.

**8...a4 9.Nc3 a3 10.Bc1 Ne4!**

Now that White can not control the a1-h8 diagonal so easily this idea is good. In the main course there are 3 variations starting from this position.

## The Dutch vs. the London System

**1.d4 f5 2.Nf3**

2.Bf4 e6 is another move order to the London System.

**2...e6 3.Bf4 Nf6 4.e3 b6**

It feels best to place the Bishop on b7 before deciding how to proceed.

**5.Bd3**

5.Be2 is an alternative way for White to play, but our plan remains the same: 5...Bb7 6.O-O Bd6!? 7.Bxd6 cxd6 8.c4 d5 9.Nc3 dxc4 10.Bxc4 Nc6 11.Rc1

11.d5 Na5 Ne7 is one of the 9 variations that we look at after 5. Be2.

**5...Bb7 6.Nbd2**

This is a very common set up that White will play, but I think Black should fear it less than the set ups with c4 and Nc3. What is the White Knight actually doing on d2!? Lets follow our main plan.

**6...Bd6!?**

This is my suggested way of developing against the London. Place one Bishop on b7 and simply swap the other one off on d6.

**7.Bxd6**

Of course we should also look at what to do when White refuses to capture on d6. In the course we look at 7.Ne5!?,

7.Bg3

and 7.c4.

**7...cxd6**

A strange structure, but one that looks fine to me. One of Black's main ideas is often to play ...d6 ...d5 and then swap off that pawn for White's c-pawn (after White plays c4) . The resulting pawn structure looks very even to me. it should be noted that this plan works especially well once White has already played h3, as h3 is an irrelevant move.

**8.c3?!**

8.c4 is better but the knight on d2 is misplaced in that case.

**8...O-O 9.O-O d5 10.a3 Ne4 11.Rc1 Rf6!?**

11...d6= Black has good attacking chances.

## 2. e4 Staunton gambit

**1.d4 f5 2.e4**

A popular variation, but certainly not something you should fear. In fact this is just the type of thing that you want when playing the Dutch. An uncompromising, unbalanced and interesting position that you can play for a win in.

**2...fxe4 3.Nc3**

3.f3 allows d5

**3...Nf6**

3...d5?? has been seen far too often 4.Qh5+± White wins the pawn back with a great position.

**4.Bg5**

Is by far the most common move, but 4. f3 is an interesting alternative that we spend 8 variations on in the main course.

**4...c6!?**

A simple idea. Black keeps options of the Queen coming out to a5 and also prepares ...d5 without worrying about any Qh5+ ideas. This move also scores the best. We look at this idea in more detail in the larger course, in 5 variations.

## The Dutch with 2. Nc3

**1.d4 f5 2.Nc3**

This used to scare me, but after filming a DVD for GingerGM with GM Roeland Pruijssers I started to like Black's position after the following sequence.

**2...Nf6**

Black needs to fight for the e4 square.

2...e6?! 3.e4

**3.Bg5**

The only logical plan. White wishes to continue with Bxf6 and e4.

**3...d5!**

Stopping White's plan. Now he must decide how to continue.

**4.Bxf6**

This would be the only move to cause me concern, but not too much concern.

4.f3!? is another move we analyze in the main course - 3 variations.

4.e3 is also possible, we spend 12 variations on this try.

**4...exf6 5.e3 Be6**

We now need to play a bit of a waiting game to see where White puts his King. This position is considered in more detail in the main course - 13 variations.

## The Dutch with 2. Bg5

**1.d4 f5 2.Bg5**

This has always been one of the most worrying moves for me and I still think that it is a good option for White. I will though, hopefully convince you, that Black is fine after ...h6 and ...g5 advancing on the Kingside.

**2...h6**

A 'kick' move. With 2...h6 Black is basically saying, 'You will not come into my territory!'

**3.Bh4**

We now have a rather strange situation. White's Bishop is in danger of being trapped but in doing so, it will weaken Black's King. Saying that, we are brave Dutch defence players so we must play the most critical variation!

White can also try 3.Bc1!?

or 3.Bf4 - we spend some time looking at these options in the main course, although they are less critical.

**3...g5**

Off we go! This brave move must be played! Yes the Black King becomes weak but Black also gains space and threats on the Kingside.

**4.e4**

The most aggressive and dangerous move. We must now trod with fear.

4.e3 is a quieter alternative that the main course spends 2 variations on.

**4...Nf6!**

The best and simplest move to learn!

**5.e5**

5.Bg3? is too meek and Black can gain a useful pawn advantage after the simple fxe4.

5.Be2?! is often an idea that White might try, but here Black just needs to avoid getting mated on h5 with 5...e6 when Black will the Bishop on h4 leaving White with insufficient compensation.

**5...e6!**

Black wants to capture back on f6 with the Queen and not a pawn. It is important to remember in this variation to not to be in a rush to snap the White Bishop on h4 off the board. The Bishop is not going anywhere, and it is better to develop some pieces first.

**6.Bg3**

6.exf6 Qxf6 7.Bg3

7.Qh5+ Qf7<level/>

7...f4 transposes.

**6...f4**

Trapping the White Bishop for good! There a number of options for White here, in what is an extremely complex situation.

**7.Bd3**

A good developing move, Black is often advised to not be in a rush to grab the Bishop on g3 in this line. Only capture it when needed. There are other options though and things can get quite complex. For that reason, lets try to verbally explain what Black is trying to achieve here. 1 Avoid getting checkmated: 2 Give the Black King some space to move to. This can be done by playing ...d5 and ...c5. 3 Attack Whites center, with ...d5 and ...c5. 4 Do not be in a rush to capture White's Bishop on g3. It is not running away and capturing it will open up the Rook on h1.

In the larger course we look at the alternatives 7.Bxf4 - 3 variations

and 7.exf6 - 1 variation.

**7...d5!**

This is a must! The Black King needs the d7 square. It is also important to take a firm grip in the center of the board.

**8.Bxf4**

I would consider this to be critical. It is funny how both sides are not in a hurry to capture their opponents minor pieces, it is more important to maintain the pressure. With this move White aims to move some of his pieces, mainly the Knight on g1, into the weakened squares on the Kingside.

**8...gxf4 9.Nh3**

As far as I can tell this is a Novelty and a very interesting one for White. The Knight brings itself into the battle via f4. The following positions are very exciting and still rather unclear. I have checked everything with Komodo 10 who assures me that Black is fine, but you do need to have nerves of steel to play this line as Black! Saying that, if you do not have nerves of steel why are playing the Dutch opening!?

9.exf6 is also considered in the main course - 3 variations.

**9...c5**

Giving our King more space on c7, whilst attacking the center of the board.

**10.Nxf4**

Bringing the Knight into the action.

**10...cxd4**

This position is considered in more detail in the main course (7 variations) . Ultimately I believe Black is doing fine in this line, but he does have to know what he is doing!

## The Classical Dutch vs. the Reti: 1. Nf3, 2. d3

**1.Nf3**

I have always enjoyed playing the Dutch against 1 Nf3. The main reason for this is that Black will often be able to play ...e5 without a fight, and then start one of our normal attacks against the White King.

**1...f5**

You should push this pawn with confidence! When playing 1. Nf3 White often has an idea about what his first ten moves will be, and playing them in a blind manner against a typical Dutch set up with ...e5 can put White on the backfoot immediately.

**2.d3**

This move was made trendy by a certain Magnus Carlsen. White aims to play e4 and challenge Black in the center.

**2...Nc6!**

This is another very exciting way of playing against 2 d3. Black's main idea is to advance in the centre with ...e5! Currently, 2...Nc6 is doing very well from a theoretical point of view and this is my main suggestion against 2. d3.

**3.e4**

3.d4!? e6! and Black can develop as in a classical Dutch position, the only difference being he has the move ...Nc6 extra! Still White has some venomous ideas here. In the larger course we look at this line in 13 variations.

**3...e5**

The point behind ...Nc6! Black responds in Kings Gambit style, offering a pawn but in return gaining the middle of the board.

**4.Nc3**

This is the position that you are most likely to reach after playing 2...Nc6.<level/>

Another variation we look at in the larger course is 4.d4!? fxe4 5.Nxe5 play has transposed to a Vienna game with colours reversed! 5...d6 6.Nxc6 bxc6 7.d5 Nf6 8.Nc3 Be7 9.Bc4 O-O 10.dxc6+ Kh8 11.O-O Qe8 Black has good attacking chances here. The simple idea is ...Qg6 and then either ...Bh3 or ...Bg4 to f3.

4.exf5 d5! is also considered in the main course.

**4...Nf6 5.exf5**

Against other moves Black will develop the Bishop on f8 play ...d6 and castle Kingside with a promising game.

**5...d5**

We now see the main reason why Black avoided playing ...d6. Black can now play ...d5 in one move, saving a tempo. White must act quickly otherwise Black will simply capture the pawn on f5 and maintain a fantastic center.

**6.d4**

The best way to cause Black some headaches, but the loss of tempo with playing d3 and then later d4 means that White won't get any advantage.

The larger course also considers the greedy alternative 6.Nh4.

**6...exd4**

The simplest and best option. 6...e4?! is slightly dubious due to 7.Nh4 when Black's compensation is somewhat lacking.

**7.Nxd4 Nxd4**

Again, simple is the best way. Black captures to win the pawn on f5 back.

**8.Qxd4 Bxf5**

A critical position for the evaluation of this opening. On all current evidence and computer calculation, Black can look to the future with confidence. It is worth remembering that in a number of lines the Black King is best placed on f7 after a check on the e-file.

**9.Bg5**

White has many alternatives on this move that we look at in the larger course:

9.Bb5+,

9.Bf4,

9.Bd3,

and 9.Qe5+.

**9...Bxc2!**

It is best to be brave; other options allow White to castle Queenside. This stops that and bags a pawn in the process! This position is examined in more detail with 6 variations in the larger course.

## The Dutch vs. the English

**1.Nf3 f5 2.g3 Nf6**

To show how I think Black should play against an English setup, I have included this model game that is featured in the main course as well as in my book 'The Killer Dutch'.

**3.Bg2 d6!?**

If Black can play ...e5 in one move then he should do! I prefer this to

3...e6 4.O-O Be7 5.d3 d6 6.c4 e5 Black has lost time.

**4.O-O**

4.d4 should lead back to our main line position after something like 4...e6 5.O-O Be7 6.c4 O-O 7.Nc3

**4...e5**

I already prefer Black's position! I may be a bit biased though...

**5.d3?!**

White is playing on auto-pilot. A big mistake, as this really does not challenge Black's plan of attack. 5.d4 is more tricky, but Black has nothing to fear 5...e4 6.Ng5 d5=

**5...Be7 6.c4 O-O 7.Nc3 a5**

Black can also play without this move. Now lets talk about the general plan for Black in this type of position. I have won countless games with...

1 Getting the Black Queen involved. ...Qe8 ...Qh5

2 Using the f-pawn. ...f4

3 Swapping off the Bishop on g2, a great defender of the White King. ...Bh3

4 Create threats against h2 ...Ng4

5 Swap off the defender of h2. The Knight on f3 ...fxg3 and ...Rxf3!

6 Checkmate on h2 ...Qxh2#

Ok, it doesn't always work this way, but things are pretty close in this game!

**8.Rb1**

Preparing to launch with a3 and b4.

**8...Kh8**

A useful waiting move. Getting off the a2-g8 line.

**9.a3 Qe8!**

Here it comes!

**10.b4 Qh5**

The Queen joins in the attack.

**11.Qb3?**

It is better for White to keep the Queen on d1 from where it may, later, be able to exchange itself off for Black's Queen.

White should have played 11.e3!. At least this attempts to stop ...f4. White would also love to swap the queens and now this may be possible if he can move the knight on f3.

**11...f4!**

Of course...

**12.Nd5**

A normal idea from White. Exchanging Knights to try and ease the attack.

**12...Nxd5 13.cxd5**

The open c-file is not a major concern for Black as he can always defend c7 with the move Bd8.

**13...axb4 14.axb4**

What to do now?

**14...Nd7!**

Again, an idea worth remembering! When the Knight on f6 has gone, use the other one!

**15.Bd2 Nf6! 16.Ra1**

Too slow.

**16...Rb8 17.Rfc1 Bh3!?**

17...Bd8 is a perfectly safe option.

**18.Be1**

White should have at least grabbed a pawn for his worries.

18.Rxc7 Better to suffer a pawn up 18...Bd8 19.Rcc1 Bb6 With a great attack for Black.

**18...Ng4**

The perfect position!

**19.b5**

Again, I think White should have tried 19.Rxc7 Bd8 20.Rc4 with some defensive chances: 20...Bb6 21.Ra2.

**19...fxg3**

Opening up the f-file.

**20.hxg3**

The only option, as 20.fxg3 loses to 20...Bxg2 21.Kxg2 Rxf3! (a standard plan in this type of position, which rips White's kingside apart) 22.exf3

22.Kxf3 Rf8+ 23.Ke4<level/>

23.Kg2 Qxh2#<level value="+2"/>

23...Qg6#<level/>

22...Qxh2+ 23.Kf1 Ne3#.

**20...Rf6!**

Now that White has played hxg3, the h-file is exposed. For this reason, Black brings his rook to h6.

20...Bxg2 was also very strong, for example, 21.Kxg2 and now Rf6

21...Rxf3? would be a mistake as White's king can escape: 22.exf3 Qh2+ 23.Kf1 Qh1+ 24.Ke2 and White is over the worst.

**21.Qa4?**

It is all over now. A better try was 21.Bh1 but 21...Bf1! should be mating. 22.Nh4 g5 23.Kxf1 gxh4 and White has no plan, except wait to be killed...

**21...Bxg2 22.Kxg2 Rh6 23.Ng1**

It is mate in two now. I will give you a couple of seconds to solve it...

**23...Qh1+ 24.Kf1 Nh2#**

Hopefully everyone will get one of those games at some point! 0-1, Sowray, P. 2364 vs. Pert, R. 2424, Douglas 2005.
