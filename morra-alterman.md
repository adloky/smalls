## Introduction

The Sicilian Defense is one of the most popular openings and it is quite difficult to cope with the many lines and theory. As an antidote the Morra Gambit was one of the first opening lines shown to me by my first chess coach.

I remember being given some photocopied pages from an old article in a chess magazine from the Soviet Union, where the ideas of the Morra Gambit were explained in depth. We seriously studied these pages and then played the Morra Gambit quite successfully.

The Morra Gambit combines lot of tactical ideas (such as a sacrifice on f7, the e4-e5 break, the Nc3-d5 sacrifice) with many positional ideas (such as strong control over the center, a space advantage, attacking via open files, dominating pieces). Let’s start with the main ideas of this famous opening line.

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3**

In the Morra Gambit White offers a pawn in exchange for speedy development and the opening up of the c- and d-files.

**3...dxc3 4.Nxc3**

White’s position already boasts several trumps:

a) An actively placed pawn on the e-file.

b) One developed piece while Black has none.

c) A space advantage.

d) Pressure over the important central squares e4, d4 and d5, with which White hopes to develop an initiative and also to prevent the mobilization of Black’s pieces.

## Bxf7 combinations

One characteristic of the Morra Gambit is that it develops along the lines of the Open Games. Combinations in the Morra Gambit also involve the weakness of f7, which we know to be the weakest spot in the opening.

**Game 78**

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 a6**

Black intends to fianchetto his bishop and is ready to hit White’s bishop with ...b5 should it land on c4.

**5.Bc4 b5?**

Black is oblivious to Whites threat. After the standard:

**6.Bxf7+ Kxf7 7.Qd5+ e6 8.Qxa8 Qc7**

Blacks only chance lies in trapping the enemy queen, but this doesn’t work. Instead 8...Nc6 9.Nf3 Qc7 10.Bf4 d6 11.e5! and White is winning easily.

**9.Be3!**

White is alert and saves his queen.

**9...Bb7 10.Qa7 Nc6 11.Qb6**

**1-0**

The queen escapes and White is an exchange up.

**What we have learned:**

- Many tactics involve the weakness of f7.

- Be alert and use tactics to save your queen which could be trapped after capturing a rook in the corner.

**Game 79**

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 d6 5.Nf3 Bg4 6.Bc4 Nf6?**

6...Nc6 covers the e5-square, but leaves the bishop unprotected on g4. f7 is also weak, defended only by the king. By exploiting these factors, White can begin a combination with the smashing:

7.Bxf7+ Kxf7 8.Ng5+ And by means of a discovered attack on the bishop, White regains his pawn. Blacks king has also lost his castling rights. 8...Ke8 9.Qxg4 Thus it is clear that White has the advantage when he has restored the material balance.

**7.Bxf7+!**

The simplest and most effective of White’s options.

**7...Kxf7 8.Ne5+!**

Because the bishop is defended, 8.Ng5+ would give White nothing. A surprise check on a square attacked by the enemy pawn, however, makes all the difference.

**8...Ke8**

The knight cannot be taken because the black queen’s only defender was distracted away on move 7, and so 8...dxe5? 9.Qxd8 would win the queen.

**9.Nxg4**

White regained his sacrificed pawn and the enemy king has lost his castling rights.

**What we have learned:**

- Bxf7 in combination with a discovered attack on the enemy bishop is a violent way of unpinning.

## The e4-e5 break!

**Game 80**

Let’s now examine Black’s defenses against the Morra. We will start off with defenses involving ...d6. The basic idea of the Morra Gambit, pushing e4-e5, can be seen most clearly in this line and the games which follow.

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 d6**

Black keeps the enemy e-pawn in check, preparing to develop his knight to f6. This also keeps the h3-c8 diagonal open for his bishop, not that it would be too happy to make an appearance on g4, as we have already seen in Games 2 and 3. His other bishop, however, has to accept a more passive role and would most likely move to e7 in preparation for castling.

**5.Bc4**

The bishop develops onto its strongest and most aggressive post where it attacks the weakest spot in Blacks position, the f7-pawn.

**5...Nf6?!**

Black continues developing calmly, but this move enables White to exploit his advantage in development:

**6.e5!**

At first sight this looks to be a blunder — Black simply captures the pawn.

**6...dxe5??**

But he will find himself in an embarrassing situation.

**7.Bxf7+!**

Diverting the king leaves the queen unprotected, and after:

**7...Kxf7 8.Qxd8**

White gains a decisive material advantage

**Game 81**

**1 .e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 d6 5.Bc4 Nf6 6.e5!**

And so Black instead has to move his knight. But where to?

6...Ng8?! can be met with the simple developing 7.Nf3! when Black is still unable to remove White’s nasty pawn: 7...dxe5?? (or 7...Bg4?! 8.Bxf7+ Kxf7 9.Ng5+) 8.Bxf7+! With a similar combination.

6...Nfd7 will be met by 7.Bxf7+ Kxf7 8.e6+ Ke8 (8...Kxe6 9.Qb3+ Kf6 10.Nd5+) 9.exd7+ keeping the initiative.

**6...Ng4!?**

Probably the best move. White can retain his initiative with the typical pawn thrust:

**7.e6!**

This cuts the connection between the c8-bishop and the hanging knight on g4. It also threatens the enemy pawn on f7.

**7...Ne5**

The best try. 7...fxe6? loses a piece to 8.Qxg4; 7...Bxe6? leads to the same outcome after 8.Bxe6 fxe6 9.Qxg4.

**8.exf7+ Nxf7**

Apart from 9.Bxf7+ Kxf7 10.Nf3, preventing Black from castling, White can also play:

**9.Nf3**

Reserving the option to exploit the weakened a2-g8 diagonal later, for example:

**9...g6**

With the idea ...Bg7 and ...O-O.

**10.O-O Bg7 11.Qb3!**

White keeps a long-term initiative; Black can hardly castle since 11...O-O will be met by 12.Bxf7+ Rxf7 13.N<sub>g</sub>5.

**Game 82**

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 d6 5.Bc4 Nc6**

This move, keeping an eye on e5, is a much better continuation.

**6.Nf3**

White completes the development of his kingside and prepares to castle.

**6...Nf6 7.e5!**

While both sides’ knights developed and took aim at e5, it is still Black’s pawn which should execute the e5-pawn. This soldier knows the aggressive posting of the light-squared bishop grants him immunity from the c6-knight.

**7...Nxe5??**

This leads to the usual theme of diverting the defender:

**8.Nxe5 dxe5 9.Bxf7+ Kxf7 10.Qxd8**

White gains a decisive material advantage.

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 d6 5.Bc4 Nc6 6.Nf3 Nf6 7.e5**

Capturing with the pawn directly is also a mistake:

**7...dxe5?**

The problem is this opens up the position for Whites better developed pieces.

The best move is 7...Ng4 and this will be studied in the Practice & Puzzles section.

**8.Qxd8+!**

Considering White wants to attack, this exchange of queens is surprising, but White’s initiative grows as he puts more pressure on Black’s position. Black has two possible recaptures:

8...Kxd8 is hoping for 9.Bxf7? which would throw away White’s initiative after 9...e6! when the bishop is trapped, but much stronger is 9.Ng5!. Black is facing a serious problem - how to stop the Nf7 fork. 9...Kc7 10.Nxf7 Rg8 And now White unleashes another blow: 11.Nxe5! Nxe5 12.Bf4 Black’s position is hopeless.

**8...Nxd8**

So, with no better choice, the queen has to be captured with the knight. Now White could capture the pawn after 9.Nxe5, but his fine mobilization allows an even more powerful punch.

**9.Nb5!**

White intends Nc7 winning a whole rook. Suddenly Black has no good answers.

After 9...Ne6? White immediately eliminates the knight with 10.Bxe6 Bxe6 and invades with the decisive fork 11.Nc7+ picking up the a8-rook.

9...Be6? also loses immediately to 10.Nc7+ Kd7 11.Nxa8 Bxc4 12.Nxe5+ 1-0 D. Thompson —  D. Levadi, Detroit 1983.

The attempt to cover c7 with 9...Kd7? simply leads to mate after 10.Nxe5+ Ke8 11.Nc7#.

**9...Rb8**

The only defense.

**10.Nxe5**

White creates the threat of Nc7 checkmate and 10...Ne6? does not help: 11.Bxe6 Bxe6 12.Nc7+ Kd8 13.Nxe6+ fxe6 14.Nf7+ Ke8 15.Nxh8+− B-Alterman - morriss, Internet Chess Club 2003.

**10...e6**

Now White could simply take the pawn after Nxa7 or continue the attack by:

**11.Nc7+ Ke7**

Let’s evaluate the position. White has completed his development, while the black pieces are mainly still on the back rank. Thus White can easily exploit the ugly position of the king on e7 by increasing his pieces’ activity and building up the unpleasant pressure.

**12.Be3**

Also good is 12.b3, gaining more development due the mating threat of Bad. For example, 12...Kd6? when after 13.Bf4 Black is lost as 13...Kxc7 14.Nxf7+ wins.

**12...Nc6 13.O-O-O Nxe5??**

A blunder. After 13...Nd7 14.Nxf7 Nde5? (better is 14...Kxf7 15.Bxe6+ Kg6 16.Bxd7 Bxd7 17.Rxd7 with a clear advantage for White) 15.Nxh8 Black resigned in the game Alikhanov - Brineva, Cherkessk 2007.

**14.Bc5#**

**What we have learned:**

- e4-e5 can open up the position for White’s pieces to exert their power.

- Watch out for tactics, those of your opponent and your own!

- Black, especially, has to be very careful.

- One slip could lead to immediate disaster, as we have seen.

## Morra Accepted - Developing the bishop to g7

**Game 83**

**B-Alterman - claymore**

Internet Chess Club 2003

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 Nc6 5.Nf3 g6**

This set-up looks solid, since Black is going to develop the bishop on the long diagonal h8-al. However this is not as easy as it looks.

**6.Bc4 Bg7**

Planning to continue developing with ...d6 and ...Nf6. But White can stop this plan by the aggressive pawn thrust:

**7.e5!**

Offering this pawn sacrifice is the only way to keep Whites initiative alive. White is gaining space and preventing ...Nf6.

Black is doing fine after 7.O-O d6! followed by ...Nf6 and ...O-O when it is hard to see any compensation for White’s pawn deficit.

After 7.O-O less clear is 7...Nf6 8.e5 Ng4 9.Bxf7+ Kxf7 10.Ng5+ and Blacks king has lost the right to castle.

**7...Nxe5 8.Nxe5 Bxe5 9.Bxf7+!**

Just like in the Open Games, White finds a combination to exploit the weakness of f7. Instead the obvious 9.Qd5 would be met by 9...Bxc3+ 10.bxc3 e6! when White’s attack is gone.

**9...Kxf7 10.Qd5+ e6**

Better is 10...Kg7 whereas 10...Kf6 could be met by 11.Ne4+ Kf5?? 12.g4+! and mate is coming soon.

**11.Qxe5**

White keeps a great initiative.

**11...Nf6 12.O-O d6 13.Qe2 Re8 14.Bg5 d5 15.Qe5 Ng4 16.Qf4+ Nf6 17.Rfe1 Kg7 18.Rad1**

By centralizing all his pieces White has created enormous pressure, and it is easy to miss the next threat...

**18...a6?**

***How can White finish the game on the spot?***

**19.Nxd5!!**

Also good enough was 19.Ne4!. The knight cannot be captured:<level/>

19...exd5 20.Rxe8 Qxe8 21.Qxf6+ Kg8 22.Bh6 with inevitable mate

19...Nxd5 20.Qe5+ and the black queen is dead.

So all Black could do was to resign immediately... **1-0**

**Game 84**

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 Nc6 5.Nf3 g6 6.Bc4 Bg7 7.e5!**

7...Bxe5 leads to a line that is similar to 7...Nxe5, after: 8.Bxf7+ Kxf7 9.Nxe5+ Nxe5 10.Qd5+<level start="7...Nxe5"/>

**7...Nh6**

Black decides to accept some temporary discomfort, waiting until after castling to get rid of the intruder on e5.

**8.O-O O-O**

And not 8...Nxe5? 9.Nxe5 Bxe5 10.Bxh6.

**9.Bf4!**

Supporting the e5-pawn and taking more control over the d6-square. Now Black must forget about playing ...d6.

**9...Nf5? 10.g4 Nh6 11.h3** The knight is trapped...

**11...Kh8**

Otherwise after 12.Qd2 the h6-knight is a goner, for instance: 11...b6? 12.Qd2 Nxg4 13.hxg4 1-0 Hennings - Basta Sohair, Lucerne 1982.

**12.Qd2 Ng8 13.Rfe1 f6 14.Rad1 fxe5 15.Nxe5 Nxe5 16.Bxe5 Bxe5 17.Rxe5 Nf6 18.Qd4** Total centralization; Black can hardly move. Let’s see one losing example: 18...e6? 19.Bxe6!

After all the exchanges, White is left with a clear superiority in development. His rooks are effectively situated on the open d- and e-files, his bishop is aggressively posted and looking at Black’s weakened kingside, and the knight controls the central squares.

## An early ...e5 is almost always bad!

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 e5?**

This move cannot be recommended. Instead of developing, Black dramatically weakens his d5-and d6-squares.

**5.Bc4 d6 6.Nf3 h6?**

This move loses instantly, thanks to the following brilliant combination:

**7.Bxf7+! Kxf7 8.Nxe5+**

The d6-pawn is pinned; Black’s king must start a hopeless journey. There are various options but no escape: 8...Ke6 9.Qd5+ Kf6 10.Qf7+! Kxe5 11.Bf4+ Kd4 12.Qd5#, 8...Ke7 9.Nd5+ Ke6 10.Qg4+ Kxe5 11.Bf4+ Kxe4 12.Nc3+ Kd4 13.Be3+ Ke5 14.Bd4# and 8...Ke8 9.Qh5+ Ke7 10.Qf7#.

**8...Kf6 9.Nd5+ Kxe5 10.Qh5+ g5**

10...Kd4 does not help: 11.Be3+ Kd3 12.Rd1+ Kc4 13.Qe2#

**11.Qf7!**

The key move of the plan; Black’s king won’t make it back home.

**11...Be6**

Now White is ready to sacrifice another piece.

**12.Bf4+ gxf4 13.Qxf4+ Kd4 14.Qe3+ Kc4 15.Qb3+ Kd4 16.Qa4+ Ke5 17.f4#**

All these lines once again show that a king in the center has no hope against a well-developed army.

**Game 85**

**B-Alterman - Switters**

Internet Chess Club 2005

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 e5? 5.Bc4**

We know 5...h6 loses by force, so Black has tried other moves: 5...Bb4? allows the same motif: 6.Bxf7+! Kxf7 7.Qb3+. 5...Be7?? loses immediately after 6.Qd5! and Black resigned in B-Alterman - lauchinis, Internet Chess Club 2006. 5...d6 6.Qb3 Qd7 7.Nf3 Nf6? 8.Ng5 d5 9.Nxd5 Be7 10.Nxf7 1-0 B-Alterman — captain, Internet Chess Club 2003.

**5...Nc6**

This move is definitely better, but even here Black is in trouble after:

**6.Qb3!**

Forcing Black’s queen to move.

**6...Qe7 7.Nd5 Nd4**

After 7...Qd6 8.Nc7+ Qxc7 9.Bxf7+ Kd8 10.Bxg8 White regains the material and keeps the better chances. For example, attempting to start a counterattack with 10...Nd4?? would be punished by 11.Bg5+! Be7 12.Bxe7+ Kxe7 13.Qf7+ Kd6 (13...Kd8 14.Qf8#) 14.Qf8+ Kc6 15.Rc1+ and Black loses his queen.

**8.Qd3 Qc5 9.Be3 Bd6 10.Ne2**

Increasing the attack on the d4-knight.

**10...Ne7 11.b4!**

The decisive strike.

**11...Qc6 12.Nxd4 exd4 13.b5 Qc5 14.Bxd4**

Black is losing at least a rook.

**14...Qa3 15.Qxa3 Bxa3 16.Nc7+**

## Black can try move orders:

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 Nc6 5.Nf3 e6 6.Bc4 Qc7**

It should be noted that 6...d6, now or anytime later, would transpose into the lines with ...d6.

**7.O-O Nf6?**

With this move order Black deliberately avoids ...d6, leaving the h2-b8 and a3-f8 diagonals open for his queen and bishop.

**8.Nb5!**

It is vital to note that typical Morra development with 8.Qe2 is just what Black wants: 8...Ng4! Preparing a fine trap. Now if White plays the obvious 9.h3?? then unexpectedly the beautiful 9...Nd4! diverts the only defender of the h2 square — the f3-knight — which leads to mate after 10.Nxd4 Qh2#.

9.Bg5?? leads to the same problem: 9...Nd4! 0—1 Boulard — Hawelko, Paris 1990.

9.Rdl? does not fix the problem, since after 9...Bc5! White cannot comfortably protect f2.

**8...Qb8 9.e5!**

White is going to sacrifice another pawn, and the main target is the unprotected c7-square. After sacrificing 2 pawns, White must play very accurately, since one false move could turn the tables immediately. On the other hand, Black has to play several only-moves in order to survive.

**9...Nxe5**

Also not good enough is 9...a6 10.exf6 axb5 11.fxg7 Bxg7 12.Bxb5, when White wins back a pawn, keeping a positional advantage thanks to Blacks exposed kingside.

If instead 9...Ng4 10.Bf4 then Black has to be very careful when choosing his next move:

a) 10...Ngxe5? loses to a neat tactic: 11.Nxe5 Nxe5 when White has a choice of wins.

12.Bxe6! is a knockout punch. Whichever way Black recaptures, he is doomed: 12...dxe6 13.Rc1 f6 14.Nc7+ or 12...fxe6 13.Qh5+ g6 14.Qxe5 Qxe5 15.Bxe5. In both variations Blacks rooks are murdered in their beds.

Also strong is the simple 12.Rc1! d6 13.Bxe5 dxe5 14.Nc7+ Qxc7 15.Bb5+ and White wins the queen.

b) 10...a6 is better but not good. After 11.Nd6+ Bxd6 12.exd6 Blacks position is very cramped.

**10.Nxe5**

After 10.Bf4 d6 11.Rcl Bd7 there are no more Nc7 tactics.

**10...Qxe5 11.Re1**

Black keeps moving his queen, while White steadily increases his lead in development by bringing more and more pieces into the attack.

**11...Qb8**

Black’s pieces are under nasty pressure and virtually all restrained to the back rank!

If 11...Qc5 12.Bf1 a6 13.Be3 Qc6 14.Na7! Qc7 15.Rc1 Qd8 16.Qc2 and Black’s c8-bishop must die.

**12.Qd4!**

The decisive move; suddenly Black has no good defenses against the coming 13.Bf4!. Even at this early stage of the game, Black is already lost.<addx start="13.Bf4"/>

**12...d6 13.Bf4 e5**

The only way to stop Nxd6. Since White has a huge lead in development the following combination is “as natural as a baby’s smile”.

**14.Rxe5+**

White ruins Black’s fragile shelter with this simple rook sacrifice. Black has to accept the rook but after:

**14...dxe5 15.Bxe5**

The queen is trapped.

**Game 86**

**Mayers - Rutter**

Lloyds Bank Open 1993

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 Nc6 5.Nf3 e6 6.Bc4 Qc7 7.O-O a6**

Black decides to secure his queen from any nasty Nb5 business.

**8.Qe2**

White continues developing in Morra-style. He frees dl for the king’s rook, which could exert serious pressure on the d-file.

**8...Nf6?!**

A careless move. Black would do better to prevent White’s aggressive operation, so I would recommend 8...d6 as the best response (which transposes into systems with ...d6 — 8...d6 9.Rd1 Nf6 10.Bf4 Be7).

**9.e5!**

This interesting move leads to a very sharp battle. Here we can see another useful point of the move 8.Qe2. White gains even more space, and challenges Black’s counterplay, which is based on a direct assault on the e5-square.

**9...Ng4 10.Bf4**

White increases his piece-activity, while also bringing more power to bear on the e5- and d6- squares.

From Black’s point of view, the e5-pawn is too strong and so he tries to destroy it immediately. However, this is premature and opens up the position, a factor which Black’s uncastled king can ill afford.

It is not so easy to escape from the pressure:

10...Be7 11.h3 Nh6 12.Rfd1 and the further Ne4! will lead to a huge positional advantage for White.

10...f5!? 11.h3 Nh6 12.Rae1 is also not so pleasant.

However, one idea that deserves attention is: 10...d6 11.exd6 Bxd6 12.Nd5 Qd8 13.Bxd6 Qxd6 14.Rad1 Qb8 15.Nb6 Ra7 16.h3 Nf6 17.Qe3 O-O 18.Rd2! Taking more control over the d-file. 18...Qc7 19.Rfd1 The black rook looks and is ugly on a7, and Black is unlikely to escape from White’s positional pressure.

**10...f6?**

Now White cannot capture at once with 11.exf6? because of 11...Qxf4. The e5-pawn cuts Black’s position in half! The queenside is completely “out of the loop” about what’s happening on the kingside.

Using the bad position of the black king, which is still stuck in the center, White unleashes a fine tactical blow, which immediately demolishes Black’s position. With White’s minor pieces

fully developed and his queen placed on the same file opposing the enemy king, the time is ripe for a sacrifice to open up the position.

**11.Nd5!**

The point! Black fears accepting the sacrifice, since after 11...exd5 the e-file can be opened to create a massive strike. 12.exf6+ Discovered check, and a discovered attack on the black queen, forcing Black’s next move. 12...Nge5 13.Nxe5 Nxe5 14.Bxe5 Qxc4 It seems that Black is still alive, however after

15.fxg7!! the smoke clears and Black is lost after either: 15...Qxe2 16.gxh8=Q which leads to huge material losses, or 15...Bxg7 16.Qh5+ Kf8 17.Qf5+ with a mating attack: 17...Ke8 (17...Kg8 18.Qg5) 18.Bxg7 Rg8 19.Rfe1+ Kd8 20.Bf6+ Kc7 21.Rac1

**11...Qb8**

If 11...Qa5 then 12.exf6 and Nc7 is inevitable.

**12.exf6 Bd6 13.Bxd6 Qxd6 14.Rad1**

14.fxg7 Rg8 15.Rfd1 is even stronger.

**14...Qb8 15.fxg7**

Blacks kingside is totally demolished, so the rest is easy:

**15...Rg8 16.h3 b5 17.Bb3 Nge5 18.Nxe5 Nxe5 19.Qh5+ Ng6 20.Nf6+ Kf7 21.Nxg8 Kxg8**

**22.Qh6 Qf4 23.Bxe6+**

**1-0**

**Sample Games**

**Game 87**

**Begin — Delorme**

Paris 1999

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 d6 5.Bc4 Nf6 6.e5! d5?!**

This “freeing” pawn move will not solve Black’s problems.

**7.Bb5+! Nfd7 8.e6!**

A typical pawn sacrifice, breaking up the enemy pawn structure and exposing his king along the h5-e8 diagonal.

**8...fxe6 9.Qh5+ g6 10.Qe5**

The queen swings to exploit the newly-created weakness of the unprotected rook in the corner.

**10...Rg8 11.Qxe6 Rh8**

The mass of pieces surrounding Blacks king is impressive, and White brings another piece into

the game.

**12.Nf3 a6**

And here White has the strong move:

**13.Ng5!**

Weaving a mating construction that forces Black to resign, since he cannot avoid: 13...Qc7 14.Qf7+ Kd8 15.Ne6# **1-0**

**Game 88**

**B. Damljanovic - D. Leskur**

Novi Sad 1989

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 d6 5.Bc4 Nc6 6.Nf3 Nf6 7.e5! Ng4**

The strongest continuation, however White has enough power to keep a strong attack.

**8.e6!**

This move has similar ideas to lines that we have already studied. Black is forced to make an unpleasant choice:

**8...fxe6**

Or 8...Bxe6 9.Bxe6 fxe6 10.Ng5 Nf6 11.Nxe6 with a strong attack.

**9.Ng5 Nf6**

9...Nge5 10.Nxe6 and Black cannot escape from White’s powerful pressure.

**10.Nxe6 Qa5 11.O-O Bxe6 12.Bxe6**

White has two bishops in an open position, and Damljanovic also keeps control over the e6- square, preventing Blacks king from leaving the center. Blacks next move is simply a clear error:

**12...Nd7?**

Trying to castle, but:

**13.Nd5!**

Moving the knight to its most aggressive outpost. Castling queenside is still impossible because Black’s queen is too cramped: so if 13...O-O-O then 14.b4! and Black is dead after either 14...Nxb4 15.Bd2 or 14...Qa6 15.a4. Black’s position is getting worse and worse...

**13...Qd8 14.b4 Nf6 15.Bb2**

White’s positional domination ruins Black’s last chance to activate his kingside pieces.

**15...g6 16.b5 Nb8 17.Rc1**

**1-0**

**What we have learned:**

- The move e4-e5 has a sound tactical basis.

- Sacrificing the pawn with e5-e6 is a key instrument of attacking play.

**Game 89**

**B-Alterman — Carpetstain**

Internet Chess Club 2005

Another set of defenses are those which involve ...e6. Black safeguards f7 against an attack, and develops his pieces without playing ...d6, trying to utilize the h2-b8 and a3-f8 diagonals which are left open as a result. Holding back on ...d6 also has disadvantages: the dark squares in Blacks camp are considerably weakened. Should White be able to utilize these weaknesses, Black can come to grief. We start off with 2 miniatures, which merely serve to exaggerate these weaknesses.

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 Nc6**

4...e6 5.Nf3 Qc7?

It is too early to develop the queen, as she immediately finds herself under fire: 6.Nb5 Qa5+

6...Qb6 7.Be3 and Black cannot continue with development — 7...Bc5? — because he would be losing after 8.Bxc5 Qxc5 9.Rc1.

Admitting his mistake and retreating with 6...Qd8 was best

7.Bd2 Bb4?

A logical development of the bishop after illogical moves with the queen. Alas, such schizophrenic play is easily refuted:

8.Nd6+

Black will lose either his c8-bishop, or the f7-pawn and the h8-rook.

1-0, Leuranguer — Baseler, Bellheim 1994.

**5.Nf3**

Both sides’ knights develop in tandem, both controlling the central squares d4 and e5.

**5...e6**

The safest set-up; Black blocks the dangerous diagonal, where, as we have already seen, catastrophes on f7 usually occur.

**6.Bc4 Bb4**

The bishop rejoices at its freedom and develops most actively, pinning the enemy knight.

**7.O-O**

The pin was short-lived, and now Blacks bishop is misplaced.

**7...Bxc3**

Not wishing to waste time retreating with his bishop, Black exchanges it off, but the dark squares are irrevocably weakened as a result.

**8.bxc3 Nge7**

**9.Ba3**

With the disappearance of the enemy dark-squared bishop, the dark squares in Black’s camp become vulnerable. Whites bishop is most actively posted here, where it bears down on the a3-f8 diagonal and the hole on d6, however more precise was 9.Qd6!.

**9...Qa5**

Instead 9...O-O also had problems, as White’s control of the dark squares is severe and could be cemented with 10.Qd6 occupying the hole on d6. 10...Re8 11.Rfd1 Black is cramped, while White has lots of useful moves. 11...Ng6 12.Rab1 a6 13.Bc5 b5 14.Bf1 Bb7 There is no other way — in order to develop the queenside Black must return the sacrificed pawn, when after 15.Qxd7 White will have the bishops and the more active pieces (Black could not play 14...Re7? due to 15.Qxc6 dxc6 16.Rxd8+).

The only chance to get rid of the pressure was 9...d5!.

**10.Qd6 Ng6?**

Black would rather not castle...

**11.Nd4 Qd8?**

Incomprehensible. Black throws in the towel, when he could have held on with 11...a6 or 11...Nxd4 12.cxd4, although White certainly has great compensation as he controls the dark squares and is preventing Black from castling.

**12.Nb5 1-0**

**What we have learned:**

- The (obvious!) importance of the dark-squared bishop in controlling the dark squares.

- The weakness of the d6- and c7-squares might be crucial when Black has surrendered the usual defender of the dark squares in his camp.

## Postscript:

It must be noted that the whole concept of Black “actively” developing the bishop to b4 is dubious, and its exchange for the knight is even more so. Just to give you a better idea of how to handle the positions that would arise, here is a sample variation, with the move ...a6 included:

**Game 90**

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 Nc6 5.Nf3 e6 6. 6.Bc4 a6 7.O-O Bb4 8.Qe2**

White is not bothered and continues with his development in Morra-style.

**8...Nge7 9.Rd1 O-O 10.e5**

The Morra-move, gaining space and also clamping down on the weakness on d6.

**10...Bxc3**

No doubt Black has less space anyway, but exchanging this bishop will be costly due to the dark-square weaknesses in Black’s camp.

**11.bxc3 Ng6 12.Ba3 Re8 13.Bd6!**

White has great compensation for the pawn.

abcdef gh

**7.Qd5!**

Attacking the h1-a8 diagonal that was weakened by Black’s last move, and also threatening to capture on f7.

**7...Qe7 8.Nxe5!!**

The main point of White’s previous move. Now best for Black would be to develop:

**8...Nf6**

8...Nxe5? 9.Qxa8 is a condemnation of the move 6...b6, when Black is an exchange down. He cannot capture White’s hanging bishop, because 9...Nxc4? 10.Qxc8+ Qd8 11.Qxc4 wins White even more material.<level start="6...b6"/>

8...Qxe5? allows White to crash through on f7 with 9.Qxf7+ Kd8 and he will regain the piece with a superior position after 10.Qxf8+.

**9.Qxf7+ Qxf7 10.Bxf7+ Kd8 11.Nxc6+**

White has a material and also a positional advantage.

**Game 92**

**Alterman - NN**

Internet 2006

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 Nc6 5.Nf3 d6 6.Bc4 a6**

By playing this move order, Black seeks to improve upon the immediate 6...Nf6, as 6...a6 prevents White’s pieces from using the b5-square. Black also prepares ...Bg4 before closing the

a2-g8 diagonal with ...e6. Strangely enough White cannot exploit the loss of tempo caused by 6...a6, since 7.e5 and the similar variations no longer work (his knight cannot go to b5!). This means that he has to continue developing:

**7.O-O Nf6 8.Qe2**

More precise is 8.Bf4! with the idea of meeting 8...Bg4 with 9.h3! Bxf3 10.Qf3 e6 11.Rfd1 with unpleasant pressure.

**8...Bg4 9.Rd1!**

Now Black had to response with 9...e6! keeping a safe position, however after:

**9...Ne5??**

abcdefgh

***White to play!***

With 9...Ne5 Black hoped to exploit the pin on the f3-knight, but was Black’s last move that great?

**10.Nxe5!**

The pieces around Blacks king have not yet moved, creating the preconditions for a mating attack by landing a blow on f7. To achieve that aim, White does not begrudge sacrificing even his queen!

**10...Bh5**

Of course 10...Bxe2 11.Bxf7 was mate, and after Blacks last move White can recycle the same idea:

**11.Qxh5!**

To remove the last defender of f7.

**1-0**

***White to play and win!***

The black queen and the c1-rook are jostling for the c-file, and even though there are hordes of pieces lined up between them, this is rather dangerous for the queen. Making the position even more precarious for Black is that he has just weakened the defense of his c6-knight with 12...b6. Can White exploit these factors to his advantage?

**13.Nd5!**

Beginning to clear the c-file.

**13...Qd8**

More tenacious is 13...Nxd5 14.Bxd5 Bb7 and Black looks to have c6 sufficiently defended, but 15.Rxc6! Bxc6 16.Rc1 wins for White.

**14.Nxf6+**

And Black resigned in light of 14...Bxf6 15.Bd5 which picks up the pinned knight.

**1-0**

Black forgets about his d6-pawn. Necessary was 10...a6.

**11.Nb5! Qb8 12.Bxd6 Bxd6 13.Nxd6 Rd8 14.e5 Ng4?**

**15.Nxf7! Kxf7 16.Ng5+**

By uncovering a discovered attack on Black’s hanging knight, White regains his piece, and remains a pawn up with the superior position.

**16...Kg8 17.Qxg4 b5? 18.Bxe6+ Bxe6 19.Qxe6+**

In the game Black played **19...Kf8** and was mated with **20.Qf7#.** After 19...Kh8 White mates with 20.Nf7+ Kg8 21.Nh6+! Uncovering a double check on precisely this square is vital — the reason will soon become clear. 21...Kh8 And in this famous type of position 22.Qg8+! forces 22...Rxg8 which immobilizes the black king by smothering him with his own pieces, leading to the well-known smothered mate 23.Nf7#.

## A final look at some lines - Black’s Main Set-up

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 d6 5.Bc4 Nc6 6.Nf3 e6**

Black erects a wall to curb the aggression of White s light-squared bishop, accepting that his own light-squared bishop will be hemmed in for several moves.

White currently has no immediate threats. There is no need to try to force a quick combination; he should instead follow the main principles of opening play — fast development, control over the center - and a tactical combination will materialize by itself!

**7.O-O Be7 8.Qe2**

In the Morra Gambit, each of the white pieces knows its deployment: the knights to c3 and f3, bishops to c4 and either f4 (supporting e4-e5) or g5 (putting pressure along the h4-d8 diagonal), queen to e2, rooks to the open files on c1 and d1. Naturally, White heads for that set-up.

**8...Nf6 9.Rd1 O-O 10.e5!**

Black did not notice his d-pawn was pinned by Whites last move, enabling him to continue with this typical Morra Gambit move to open lines for Whites better developed pieces.

**10...Ne8 11.exd6**

Black already has a chance to go astray with:

**11...Nxd6?**

It was much better to capture with the bishop. Now after:

**12.Bf4!**

abcdefgh

White develops his last piece to exploit the lethal pin.

**12...Qc7 13.Nb5**

Winning material and the game.

**Game 95**

**Alterman - NN**

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 d6 5.Bc4 Nc6 6.Nf3 e6 7.O-O Be7 8.Qe2 Nf6 9.Rd1 O-O 10.e5! Ne8 11.exd6 Bxd6**

This is the only move, freeing an additional square on e7 for the black queen to escape the pin.

**12.Ne4!**

12.Bf4 Qe7 does not give White much.

**12...Qc7**

Things are not so easy for Black and after 12...Qe7 13.Bg5! (weakening the e6-pawn) 13...f6

14.Be3 Black has to solve his development problems:

14...Bc7? loses to 15.Bc5.

14...Bd7? 15.Nxd6 Nxd6 16.Bc5 with a huge edge.

14...b6 seems like the only way, however even here White retains unpleasant pressure.

**13.Nxd6 Nxd6 14.Bb3!**

Unfortunately 14.Bf4 is not winning due to 14...e5! and any simplifications are in Black’s favor: 15.Nxe5 Nxe5 16.Qxe5 Qxc4 with equal chances.

By playing 14.Bb3! White is trying to keep more tension.

**14...Rd8**

It is not so easy to get rid of Whites initiative, for instance: 14...e5 15.Nxe5 Re8 16.Bf4 or 14...b6 15.Bf4 Rd8 16Qd2.

**15.Bf4 Qe7 16.Rac1!**

After improving the position of all his pieces White is ready to use the open files with his heavy forces.

**16...Qf8 17.Ne5 Nxe5 18.Bxe5**

abcdefgh

Black is under strong pressure and, as usual in the Morra, just one slip is fatal:

**18...f6? 19.Bxd6 Rxd6 20.Rxd6 Qxd6 21.Rxc8+!**

A neat combination - Black is going to lose his hanging rook on the back rank.

The safest set-up for Black is to be cautious in the deployment of his pieces.

**10.Bf4 a6**

Black has to keep White’s knight out of b5. This move also creates the preconditions for a queenside expansion with ...b5 in the near future.

As ever, Black must be extremely careful to avoid instant disaster. For example: 10...Ne5? Trying to block the bishop’s diagonal and shield d6. 11.Bb5+ Clearing the c-file for the rook to menace the enemy queen. 11...Bd7 12.Rac1 O-O 13.Bxe5 White forces open the d-file with this exchange. Now, White’s rooks will radiate their full power down the c- and d-files. 13...dxe5 14.Nd5 The discovered attack is decisive. 14...Bxb5 (also losing is 14...Qd8 15.Nxf6+ Bxf6 16.Rxd7) 15.Qxb5 Qd8 16.Nxf6++− With yet another discovered attack on Black’s queen.

**11.Rac1**

Finally, White has brought all his pieces into the game.

**11...Ne5?**

Moving the knight again is pointless, and merely helps White to clear the c-file for yet another devastating discovered attack.

**12.Bxe5 dxe5**

abedef gh

**13.Nb5!**

A nice tactical shot, exploiting the enemy queens location on the same file as the cl-rook.

**13...Qb8**

13...axb5 14.Bxb5+ is a winning discovered attack on Blacks queen.

**14.Nc7+! Kf8**

The knight is immune because of the discovered attack: 14...Qxc7 15.Bb5+

**15.Nxa8 Qxa8 16.Nxe5** Black soon resigned.

**10.Bf4 Be7 11.Rac1**

Via a different move-order, the same position as after White's 11th move in the previous game is reached.

**11...Qb8?!**

Premature prophylaxis. Understandably, the queen does not feel comfortable standing on the same file as the enemy rook, especially since the pieces standing in-between could easily be removed (recall the various discovered attacks from the previous game). However, Black spends a valuable tempo for this, and his king remains in the center for one more move. Correct was 11...O-O - see the Theory section for more detail.

**12.h3**

White is fully mobilized and plans to play e4-e5, but first he spends a move to secure a home for his bishop on h2 in the event of ...Nh5.

**12...O-O 13.e5!**

Naturally, White opens up the position to exploit his lead in development.

**13...dxe5 14.Nxe5 Nxe5**

Obviously bad is 14...Bd6? 15.Nxc6 Qc7 16.Bxd6 Qxc6 17.Bxf8 Kxf8 18.Rd8+.

**15.Bxe5 Qa7 16.Ne4!**

Whites remaining pieces are taking aim at Black’s kingside, and so he launches an attack there. The first step is to thin out the line of defenders through exchanges.

**16...b5?**

The text move allows White to crash straight through, so Black should instead have tried: 16...Nxe4 17.Qxe4

The exchanges have improved the placing and scope of White’s pieces, while Black’s queenside is still undeveloped and his kingside has too few defenders.

17...b5 18.Bd3

Funnily enough the computer points out that 18.Bb3! instead leads to an immediate win:

18...Bb7 19.Qg4 g6 20.Rd7+−

18...f5 19.Qf4

White has a strong initiative.

**17.Nxf6+**

White forces a fatal weakening of Black’s kingside defenses.

**17...Bxf6**

If instead 17...gxf6, then the game would follow a similar path after the accurate 18.Qg4+! Kh8 19.Bd4! Qb7 20.Qh4+− bxc4 21.Bxf6+ Bxf6 22Qxf6+.

**18.Bxf6 gxf6 19.Qg4+ Kh8**

Now White should have concluded matters with:

**20.Qh4!**

When it is not clear how Black can prevent checkmate.

**20...bxc4**

If 20...Qe7 21.Bd3 and there is no way of stopping mate other than 21...f5 22.Qxe7 which loses the queen, while 20...Kg7 is met with the brutal rook lift 21.Rc3.

**21.Qxf6+ Kg8 22.Rc3**

Black has to resign.

**What we have learned:**

- The move e4-e5 is an integral part of the Morra Gambit, opening up lines for White’s better developed pieces.

- Then, after opening up the position, look for ways to exploit your lead in development and better-placed pieces.

- Always watch out for tactics.

**Game 98**

**B-Alterman — alebio**

Internet Chess Club 2005

Having felt the power of the move e4-e5, Black players devised a defensive system aimed at preventing it. This line involves radically changing the pawn structure:

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3**

Most players would not hesitate to take the pawn on offer and force White to prove his compensation, although there are indeed some who prefer not to dabble in gambit waters, and would rather steer the game towards the more commonly-seen channels of the Alapin Sicilian. 3...d3 is one way to decline the gambit, while 3...d5 4.exd5 Qxd5 5.cxd4 or 3...Nf6 4.e5 Nd5 would indeed transpose into the Alapin — a non-gambit line that is not suitable for this book.

**4.Nxc3 Nc6 5.Bc4 e6 6.Nf3 d6 7.O-O Be7**

Black sometimes plays:

7...a6

This is prophylaxis against Nb5, especially since after Qe2 and Rd1 Blacks queen will be going to c7. Black may also opt for an early ...b5.

8.Qe2 Be7

It is safer to develop the bishop first before the knight, since the e-file is now sheltered against a menacing heavy piece on the opposite side of the board. This is especially important in case White sacrifices on d5, when Black’s king has the additional square on f8 to run to.

However Black could also play an immediate 8...b5 9.Bb3 and now there is a split:<level/>

9...Ra7 10.Rd1 Rd7 is a creative rook lift to support the d6-pawn.<level/>

9...Bb7 10.Rd1 Qc7, when Black develops his queenside more traditionally.<level/>

9.Rd1 Qc7 10.Bf4 b5?

This move weakens Black’s queenside too much.

11.Bb3 Bb7 12.Rac1 Nf6

And now the typical punch:

13.Nd5!

Black has no good answer, so let’s just see 2 possible lines: 13...Qa5 14.Nxe7 Nxe7 15.Bxd6 with a huge advantage. 13...exd5 14.exd5 O-O 15.dxc6 Bc8 (or 15...Bxc6 16.Nd4) and Black’s position is already hopeless.

**8.Qe2 Nf6 9.Rd1**

In the main variation:

9...Qc7 10.Bf4 a6 11.Rac1 O-O

White could try a fresh idea.

12.e5!?

After the well known 12.Bb3 (see Black’s Main Set-up) 12...b5? 13.Nd5! White has a clear advantage.<level/>

Instead of 12...b5, Black can try 12...Rd8 13.h3 when 13...b5? would also run into 14.Nd5 exd5 15.exd5 Bd7 16.dxc6 Bf5 17.Bc2 Bxc2 18.Qxc2 Rac8 19.Nd4 when White is dominating, Kabanov — Andreeva, Pardubice 2006.<level/>

After 12...Nh5 13.exd6 Nxf4 14.dxc7 Nxe2+ 15.Bxe2 Bb4 16.Nd4 Ba5 17.Nxc6 bxc6 18.Na4! Black has to work for a draw.<level/>

13.Nxe5 Nxe5 14.Bxe5 Qa5 15.Bb3 b5 16.Ne4!

White still has an unpleasant initiative and controls the key open files and diagonals.

**9...e5!?**

abcdef gh

A pawn move that accepts great responsibilities; Black prevents forever the threat of e4-e5, but fixes the central pawn structure. Now both sides will be fighting for the d5-square, with White trying to occupy it while Black is trying to liberate his position with the push ...d6-d5.

**10.h3**

If White wishes to fight for the d5-square by developing his bishop to g5 then 10.h3 is necessary to prevent a pin with ...Bg4.

If White wishes to do without h2-h3 then he has to develop his dark-squared bishop to e3 —

10.Be3 - to take control of the d4-square. This is important since if his bishop is on g5 White cannot meet ...Bg4 with h2-h3 due to ...Nd4!. Thus, having the bishop on e3 would relieve White of the necessity of an exchange sacrifice on d4 should Black try a similar line.

**10...O-O 11.Bg5**

A classical deployment of forces in the fight for the d5-square in the Sicilian.

**11...Be6 12.Bxf6**

A defender of d5 is exchanged...

**12...Bxf6**

12...Bxc4? allows White to intensify his initiative. 13.Qxc4 Bxf6 14.Rd3 Rc8 15.Qb5 The queen targets the weakness on b7. 15...Qd7 16.Rad1! By exploiting the pin along the d-file, White easily regains his pawn.

**13.Nd5 Bxd5**

And another black defender of d5 disappears — the knight was too powerful!

**14.Bxd5**

abcdefgh

White is edging ever closer to his dream of having one of his minor pieces planted on d5 against the sickly enemy dark-squared bishop. Having his knight there would give rise to the well-known good knight versus bad bishop situation, while with a bishop on d5 the opposite-colored bishop position would be clearly in White’s favor as he has the more active and attacking bishop. In either case, White would not mind being short of a pawn, since the domination of his pieces would more than compensate for his material deficit.

**14...Qb6 15.Rd3**

A multi-purpose move, aiming both to exploit the 3rd rank for active operations and to double rooks, targeting the weak d6-pawn.

**15...a6 16.Rad1 Be7 17.Rb3 Qc7 18.Rc3**

Through several intelligent maneuvers, White repositioned his rook on a better square while causing his opponent to become less active.

**18...Rfc8 19.Rdc1 Qd7 20.a3**

White is trying to restrict the mobility of the enemy’s best piece, his knight.

**20...Nd4**

Black seeks to relieve the pressure through exchanges.

**21.Nxd4 exd4 22.Rc4**

The aforementioned opposite-colored bishop scenario has materialized.

**22...Bf6 23.b4**

In accordance with the rule: put your pawns on squares of the opposite color to your bishop.

**23...Rxc4?! 24.Qxc4**


Now White dominates the only open file on the board.

**24...g6 25.Kf1**

25.Qc7! was more direct.

**25...Rd8 26.Ke2 Kg7 27.Kd3 Qa4 28.Qb3 Qxb3+?**

The opposite-colored bishop endgame is clearly in White’s favor, since he has the more active pieces.

**29.Bxb3 Rd7 30.Bd5**

The bishop attacks both the kingside and queenside.

**30...Be5 31.a4! Bf6 32.a5!**

White’s pawns improve their position, while fixing the weaknesses of Black’s queenside pawns.

**32...h5 33.Rc8**

The time for the decisive invasion has arrived.

**33...h4**

Black fixes the kingside pawns, but this is of no concern to White.

**34.Rb8**

The enemy pawns start falling like ripe fruit.

**34...Rc7 35.Rxb7 Rc3+ 36.Ke2 d3+ 37.Kd2 Rc2+ 38.Kxd3 Rxf2 39.Rxf7+**

Black is busted on the kingside as well.

**39...Kh6 40.b5!**


Passed pawns must be pushed!

**40...axb5 41.a6 1-0**

**What we have learned:**

- First, the exchange of White’s dark-squared bishop for Black’s f6-knight, then the removal of Black’s light-squared bishop — these are key techniques in the fight for the d5-square in the Sicilian.

- Positions with opposite-color bishops favor the side whose bishop is more active.

- Place your pawns on the opposite-colored square to your bishop.

- Passed pawns must be pushed!

**Summary:**

The Morra Gambit combines many tactical ideas (such as a sacrifice on f7, the e4-e5 break, the Nc3-d5 sacrifice) with many positional ideas (such as strong control over the center, a space advantage, attacking via open files, domination, and so on). Sometimes White has no immediate threats, but instead has long-term positional pressure. There is no need to try to force a quick combination; White should instead follow the main principles of opening play - fast development, control over the center — and a tactical combination will materialize by itself!
