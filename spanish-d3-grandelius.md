### (527) 25. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 4th Move - 4...Ne7 #1

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Ne7**

This looks ridiculous, but does contain some logic. The first point is that 5.Nxe5?? does not work due to 5...c6! followed by Qa5+, picking up the e5-knight. The other, slightly more serious idea is that the knight is more harmoniously placed on g6 than on c6, which makes sense. On the other hand ...Ne7 does give us some extra time to take over the centre.

**5.O-O**

A practical decision. We are not trying to punish Black immediately, but rather just make natural moves, setting up our normal sort of position and being content with a slight edge. 5.Nc3 c6 6.Bc4 intending a quick d4 is a more ambitious way, which leads to an edge for White as well, but requires much more detailed theoretical knowledge which I think we don't need to bother with.

**5...c6 6.Ba4 Ng6 7.d4**

A small move order trick. It is too dangerous for Black to open up the centre at the moment.

**7...Nxe4 8.Qe2 d5 9.c4**

open up the centre before Black can get their king into safety.

**9...Be6 10.cxd5 Bxd5 11.Bc2**

Provoking further weaknesses

**11...f5 12.Nc3 Nxc3 13.bxc3 e4 14.c4**

gives us a huge initiative. Next, up is Ng5, followed by d5 opening up the centre further. Even giving a piece on e4 could be promising later on.

### (528) 25. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 4th Move - 4...Ne7 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Ne7**

**5.O-O**

**5...c6 6.Ba4 Ng6 7.d4**

**7...Nxe4 8.Qe2 d5 9.c4**

**9...Be6 10.cxd5 Bxd5 11.Bc2**

**11...f5 12.Nc3 Nxc3 13.bxc3 Be7**

Just giving back the pawn is a more solid option for Black.

**14.dxe5 O-O 15.Nd4**

A good move. Material equality is restored, and the combination of Ng6 and pawn f5 makes a strange impression. The f5-pawn is under attack, and moving it forward would open the c2-h7 diagonal for our bishop.

### (529) 25. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 4th Move - 4...Ne7 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Ne7**

**5.O-O**

**5...c6 6.Ba4 Ng6 7.d4**

**7...d6 8.Re1 exd4 9.Nxd4**

Intending c4, giving us a nice spatial edge.

### (530) 25. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 4th Move - 4...Ne7 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Ne7**

**5.O-O**

**5...c6 6.Ba4 Ng6 7.d4**

**7...d6 8.Re1 Be7 9.c3**

Simply defending d4, and setting up the typical Ruy Lopez centre. Although Black is solid here, there is also no significant pressure on our centre, meaning we have a small but comfortable edge.

**9...O-O 10.Bc2**

Overprotecting e4, preparing the maneuver Nbd2-f1-g3. Another nice point is that we never need h3, as without the knight on c6 the move ...Bg4 does not really put any pressure on our d4-pawn.

**10...Re8 11.Nbd2**

We are slightly better, and I don't think it's really necessary to know any more concrete theory. A logical continuation is Nf1-g3, but also grabbing space on the queenside with a4-a5 makes sense. Black is certainly solid and it is definitely not a refutation of 4...Ne7, but our edge is anyway bigger here than in the usual d3-Berlins, which I think should be enough for us.

### (531) 25. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 4th Move - 4...a6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 a6 5.Bxc6**

Just wins the e5-pawn, which is one of the main points of 4.d3!

### (532) 25. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 4th Move - 4...Bd6 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bd6**

Another weird-looking move. Black anticipates our capture on c6, after which the bishop would be decently placed on d6. If we don't take, the idea is to play ...O-O, ...Re8, and ...Bf8, after which the d5-break can come in one move.

**5.O-O O-O 6.Re1 Re8 7.Bg5**

This would be very similar to thesubsequent line, but including ...a6 Ba4 is always in Black's favour.

### (533) 25. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 4th Move - 4...Bd6 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bd6**

**5.O-O a6**

Useful to flick in, now that we don't want to take on c6.

**6.Ba4 O-O 7.c3**

7.Re1 intending d4 without c3 is also interesting, but 7.c3 goes well with the rest of our repertoire. Now the position is very likely to transpose to the Anti-Berlinwith 6...Re8.<skip value="6...Re8"/>

**7...h6**

this is a bit too slow.

**8.Nbd2 b5 9.Bc2 Bc5**

does not, in fact, stop d4.9...Be7 10.d4 would give us a fantastic version of the 6.d3 d6 Ruy Lopez, as Black has nothing to show for the tempo loss Bd6-e7.<skip start="6.d3"/>

**10.d4 exd4 11.e5**

followed by Ne4, with an overwhelming advantage.

### (534) 25. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 4th Move - 4...Bd6 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bd6**

**5.O-O a6**

**6.Ba4 O-O 7.c3**

**7...Re8 8.Bg5**

Black should move the d6-bishop, but no matter if it goes to e7 or f8, with or without h6, we will get something very much like the8...Be7 lines.

### (535) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...Be7 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

Black's second most popular move. In a higher sense, the move 4...Bc5 is a try for equalizing concretely, whereas 4...d6 is a move more likely to be chosen by those who want a fight with Black. As such, it should certainly be welcomed by us. The play now resembles our normal Ruy Lopez repertoire and indeed it most often transposes at some point. Here I will instead show some tries for Black to avoid the transposition.

**5.O-O**

5.c3 is a possible move order and likely to transpose to our Ruy Lopez 5.d3 repertoire, for instance after 5...g6 6.O-O Bg7 7.Re1 O-O 8.h3 and Black should play ...a6 at some point, with a direct transposition.<skip start="5.d3"/>

**5...Be7**

A normal and popular move, but does have very little independent value for our repertoire.

**6.c3 O-O 7.Re1 Bd7**

Transposes to the5...Bd7 move order.

### (536) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...Be7 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...Be7**

**6.c3 O-O 7.Re1 a6 8.Ba4**

is a position from our Ruy Lopez 6.d3 d6 repertoire.<skip/>

### (537) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...Bd7 6.Re1 g6 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...Bd7**

This has gone completely out of fashion. Generally speaking, Black is getting a slightly less flexible version of similar positions that we have already investigated, but there are a few specific lines.

**6.Re1 g6**

Is considered dubious and quite rarely played.

**7.c3**

Intending to transpose to our Ruy Lopez 5.d3 repertoire, but in a version where Black is already committed to ...Bd7.7.d4 is the main theoretical move, but can get really sharp so I don't believe there is any need to study it.<skip/>

**7...Bg7 8.h3 O-O**

Black is trying to play without ...a6 whatsoever.

**9.a4**

An interesting additional possibility we have here. The idea is simply to grab as much space as possible on the queenside.

**9...a6 10.Bc4**

Is a square we have almost never seen the bishop on, but here it works well.

**10...h6 11.a5**

Gives the usual kind of play, but our extra space with a5 is very useful for the future. Next up we play d4 and develop our pieces.

### (538) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...Bd7 6.Re1 g6 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...Bd7**

**6.Re1 g6**

**7.c3**

**7...Bg7 8.h3 O-O**

**9.a4**

**9...a6 10.Bc4**

**10...Na5**

Before we have time to play a5 ourselves.

**11.Ba2 c5 12.Bg5**

One of many moves, but very logical. We simply intend to gain control of the d5-square by giving up our bishop on f6 - an idea we have already seen numerous times in the 6.d3 b5 chapters.<skip/>

### (539) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...Bd7 6.Re1 Be7 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...Bd7**

**6.Re1 Be7**

A rare line. Black is making use of not having included ...a6 and Ba4 by trying to trade the light-squared bishops later on. It's solid, but also pretty passive and not very inspiring.

**7.c3 O-O 8.Nbd2**

Sticking to our usual scheme of development.

**8...Re8 9.Nf1**

The most natural move, putting the knight on g3 and intending to push d4. Another interesting idea is 9.Ba4!? to avoid Black's plan in the mainline.

**9...Bf8 10.Bg5**

The typical reaction to ...Bf8 if Black omits ...h6. The pin is pretty annoying for Black.

### (540) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...Bd7 6.Re1 Be7 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...Bd7**

**6.Re1 Be7**

**7.c3 O-O 8.Nbd2**

**8...Re8 9.Nf1**

**9...h6**

By far the most common move. Black prepares ...Bf8 followed by Ne7.

**10.Ng3 Bf8 11.h3**

Please, don't fall for 11.d4? Nxd4!

**11...Ne7**

Black's idea by not playing ...a6 ever. With our bishop on b5 we can't retreat it to c2, meaning we have to agree on the trade. However, Black spent a lot of time making the trade happen, and we are in time to solidify our centre in the meantime.

**12.Bxd7**

I once played 12.Bc4 Naiditsch against Naiditsch myself, but just trading the bishops and taking the centre looks simpler.

**12...Qxd7 13.d4**

With our solid centre we have a comfortable edge. Next up just develop the remaining pieces, centralize the rook and enjoy life.

**13...Ng6 14.Be3**

Allowing Black's next.

**14...exd4 15.Bxd4**

Forced, but we don't mind it. Next, we can follow up with c4 and our bishop is well-placed on the long diagonal. We no longer have our two abreast centre, but we still have a significant space advantage.

### (541) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Bg4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

A slightly strange-looking but in fact quite ambitious move. Black makes use of the fact that our bishop is trapped!

**6.Bxc6+**

Gaining both time and a structural edge in return for the bishop. 6.Ba4 b5 7.Bb3 Na5 would also lose the bishop, but would have got much less in return.

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

We are intending to play d4 and recapture with our knight on d4, for which the e4-pawn needs to be defended.

**7...Bg4**

As so often in the Spanish, playing ...Bg4 while our pawn is still on d3 does not make a lot of sense. The bishop will either have to give up itself on f3 or get out of play on h5.

**8.Nbd2 Be7 9.h3 Bxf3 10.Nxf3**

Without the bishop pair, Black has nothing to compensate for the worse structure.

### (542) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Bg4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Bg4**

**8.Nbd2 Be7 9.h3 Bh5 10.Nf1**

The bishop is simply not well placed on h5. Next, we play Ng3, and after ...Bg6 the maneuver Nh4-f5 makes a lot of sense. Long term we are still intending to play in the centre with c3 and d4.

### (543) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 c5 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...c5**

This stops our immediate plan, but creates a 'hook' on c5.

**8.c3**

This is very important. It might look strange to play d4 and trade off Black's doubled pawns, but as the famous quote goes: the important thing is not what is leaving the board, but what remains. In the remaining structure Black still has a poor structure with 3 pawn islands to our two, meaning our structural edge is in fact not decreasing at all.

**8...Be7 9.d4 cxd4 10.cxd4 exd4 11.Nxd4 Bd7 12.Nc3**

These kind of positions are very pleasant for White. We have a lot of very natural developing moves, whereas Black struggles to find anything useful to do as we have such a firm grip of the centre.

### (544) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 c5 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...c5**

**8.c3**

**8...Bg4**

On the previous move this was poor, but now we are clearly intending to play d4, which would make the bishop serve a purpose by indirectly attacking the centre.

**9.h3 Bh5 10.d4**

Anyway! It turns out that Black's neglecting of kingside development is important.

**10...cxd4 11.cxd4 Bxf3**

would be the point of ...Bg4, but does not work out well at all.

**12.Qxf3 exd4 13.e5**

Gives us a huge initiative and easily winning back the pawn whenever we want, for instance

**13...dxe5 14.Qc6+ Nd7 15.Rxe5+ Be7 16.Rd5**

Black is all tied up and it looks super scary.

### (545) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 c5 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...c5**

**8.c3**

**8...Bg4**

**9.h3 Bh5 10.d4**

**10...Nd7**

Keeping the centre closed.

**11.Be3**

Important, as we want to settle Black with a sad isolated doubled pawn.

**11...cxd4 12.cxd4**

Is similar to 8...Be7. We have a nice space advantage and many easy moves.

### (546) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 c5 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...c5**

**8.c3**

**8...Bg4**

**9.h3 Bh5 10.d4**

**10...Nd7**

**11.Be3**

**11...Be7 12.dxc5 dxc5 13.Nbd2**

Black has kept the centre under control, and has the bishop pair, but the position is of a closed nature and our knights are equally strong. The ugly doubled c-pawns, therefore, give us a pleasant edge.

### (547) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

By far the main move.

**8.d4**

Our@idea is to increase our space advantage. A funny thing is that this position can also be reached via 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O d6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 8.d4 .

**8...Nd7**

Another reasonably popular move, played for instance by Short and Ponomariov. Black is trying to hold onto the e5-pawn, but it does look awfully passive.

**9.Na3**

A slightly unusual route for the knight, but as both the e5 and c6-pawns are possible targets, it makes a lot of sense to bring our knight to c4.

**9...O-O 10.Nc4 f6 11.Na5**

would force ...Nb8, which is just way too passive for Black.

### (548) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

**8.d4**

**8...Nd7**

**9.Na3**

**9...O-O 10.Nc4 Bf6**

is a very clumsy way of protecting e5.

**11.dxe5**

Black will either end up with a very passive f6-bishop, or trade it off and be left with no compensation for the worse structure.

**11...dxe5 12.b3**

is just very, very nice for us.

### (549) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

**8.d4**

**8...Nd7**

**9.Na3**

**9...O-O 10.Nc4 exd4**

Probably the best try, but it does not inspire confidence.

**11.Nxd4 Bb7 12.Na5**

would lose material instantly

### (550) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

**8.d4**

**8...Nd7**

**9.Na3**

**9...O-O 10.Nc4 exd4**

**11.Nxd4 Nb8**

This looks pretty sad for Black, but it was played by the great Paul Keres, so I will show a few more moves.

**12.Na5 c5 13.Nf5**

13.Ndc6 to pick up the e7-bishop also makes sense, but I like the text better. We now have a very comfortable, active, and easy to play position. Next up we can play Qf3 and then develop our queenside. Black is just too passive for the bishop pair to have any effect.

### (551) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

**8.d4**

**8...exd4 9.Nxd4 Bd7**

An interesting strategical position. Black has the bishop pair, but we have a space advantage and the doubled c-pawns are slightly weak. The main thing we should do is try to prevent Black from breaking free in the centre.

**10.c4**

Not the most common move, but I quite like it. By playing c4 before Nc3 we make sure that ...d5 will be impossible for Black to achieve without damaging his position.

**10...d5**

Is still technically possible, but would be breaking the old rule of not opening up in the centre when being behind in development. There is no direct refutation for us, but we have numerous ways of reaching a very pleasant position.

**11.exd5 cxd5 12.cxd5**

The simplest. We open up as quickly as possible.

**12...Nxd5 13.Qh5**

A powerful move, making use of Black not having castled yet.

**13...Nf6 14.Qc5**

This is the problem for Black and shows very clearly why the move 10...d5 was premature. Due to the pin along the e-file Black can't get castled.

**14...Kf8 15.Qc2**

is just terrible for Black, as it will take too long for Black to reroute the king. We can just develop normally and have a huge advantage.

### (552) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

**8.d4**

**8...exd4 9.Nxd4 Bd7**

**10.c4**

**10...d5**

**11.exd5 cxd5 12.cxd5**

**12...Nxd5 13.Qh5**

**13...c6 14.Bg5**

Again utilizing the pin on the e-file, but this time only to gain a positional advantage by trading the bishops.

**14...O-O 15.Bxe7 Nxe7 16.Nc3**

We did not win anything directly, but Black no longer has the bishop pair and the pawn structure is even worse than before. Both c6 and a6 are weak, and we have an excellent square for a knight or queen on c5.

### (553) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

**8.d4**

**8...exd4 9.Nxd4 Bd7**

**10.c4**

**10...O-O 11.Nc3 c5**

is one of Black's main ideas - they give back the bishop pair but the trade makes the space advantage less of a factor.

**12.Nf5 Bxf5 13.exf5**

is usually slightly better for White. We still have some extra space and the more active pieces, and the Black majority looks immobile.

**13...Nd7 14.Bd2**

Next we go Qc2, Rad1 and then look for knight jumps to e4 or d5.

### (554) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

**8.d4**

**8...exd4 9.Nxd4 Bd7**

**10.c4**

**10...O-O 11.Nc3 Re8**

Universally useful, and the most flexible here.

**12.h3**

A small improving move, waiting for Black to choose a plan before we decide where we want our queen and bishop.

**12...Bf8**

Also natural, but now the bishop can never get to f6.

**13.Bf4 c5 14.Nf3**

Is an interesting change of track here, although 14.Nf5 also makes sense.

**14...Bc6 15.Qd3**

Here Black would really want ...Nd7 followed by ...Bf6, but that isn't possible with the bishop already on f8.

### (555) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

**8.d4**

**8...exd4 9.Nxd4 Bd7**

**10.c4**

**10...O-O 11.Nc3 Re8**

**12.h3**

**12...c5**

The most direct move.

**13.Nf5 Bxf5**

is similar to 11...c5. Black is just a bit worse without any real counterplay.

**14.exf5 Nd7 15.Bd2 Bf6 16.Rxe8+ Qxe8 17.Qc2**

We have nice control of the position. Long term, even a pawn push on the kingside could be an interesting idea.

### (556) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

**8.d4**

**8...exd4 9.Nxd4 Bd7**

**10.c4**

**10...O-O 11.Nc3 Re8**

**12.h3**

**12...c5**

**13.Nf5 Bf8**

The critical move. Black is threatening ...Nxe4!

**14.Ng3**

Voluntarily retreating, but the knight is pretty good on g3, making our e4-pawn well protected. In character, the position hasn't changed a lot. We still intend to develop our remaining pieces and keep control of our extra space. An additional resource that can be of relevance is Nd5, as our e4-pawn is secure.

**14...Bc6 15.Bg5**

Provoking some weaknesses.

**15...h6 16.Bd2 g6**

The most natural plan, activating the bishop on the long diagonal.

**17.Qc2 Bg7 18.Rad1**

Bringing the last piece into the game. We have certainly left the opening phase now. Black has the bishop pair, but still lacks clear targets for attack. Our next moves are likely b3 followed by Nd5, with the idea of Bc3 trading the dark-squared bishops. Black is certainly solid, but it does look like a pleasant position for us to play.

### (557) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Nxd5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

The most active and best move. Black takes the liberty of developing the bishop outside the pawn chain - made possible by our move 4.d3.

**5.c3**

In recent top-level practice this has gone a bit out of fashion, but in relation to the rest of our repertoire it makes a lot of sense. The idea is similar to many of our other lines - we intend to push d4 at an appropriate moment. Black has a very important choice to make now: either develop calmly with O-O, d6 and so on, or go for the immediate ...d5-push. Whereas the slower play leads to positions with a lot of fight for both colours, the d5-lines are generally more forcing in nature and Black is really trying to equalize by very concrete means. 5.c3 is necessary immediately, as if we start with 5.O-O Black has the very annoying 5...Nd4 which trades off the bad c6-knight and equalizes comfortably.

**5...d5**

This immediate ...d5 break is the most popular alternative to 5...O-O in practical play. It was for instance played against me by the theory-expert Vidit in a classical game in 2020.

**6.exd5 Nxd5 7.O-O O-O 8.Bxc6 bxc6 9.Nxe5**

is just a pawn up.

### (558) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd8 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...d5**

**6.exd5 Qxd5**

This is always the best recapture for Black. The queen defends the e5-pawn and the knight is well placed on f6.

**7.Bc4**

Necessary, as Black was threatening ...Bxf2+.

**7...Qd8**

I consider this to be a slightly inaccurate move order for Black. If they want their queen on d8, then it's better to play ... d5 on move 6, as will be explained later.

**8.Bg5**

Generally speaking, this is a good move in these structures. After Black has played ...d5 and we took exd5 the c1-bishop is struggling to find a useful square. Therefore we are prepared to trade it on f6. This would leave us with only good pieces left, and again quite nice control of the light squares in the centre.

**8...Bf5 9.Qe2 O-O 10.Nbd2 h6 11.Bxf6 Qxf6 12.O-O**

is quite similar to the mainline. Another highly interesting option is 12.Ne4 Qe7 13.Rg1!? intending to push g4-g5, but it seems a bit unnecessary to me.

### (559) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd8 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...d5**

**6.exd5 Qxd5**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Qd8**

**8.Bg5**

**8...e4**

is very good with O-O included for both sides.

**9.Qe2**

This is the key difference to the position with both sides having castled already.

**9...O-O 10.dxe4**

Does not give Black enough compensation for the pawn. If need be, we can even castle long later on.

### (560) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd8 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...d5**

**6.exd5 Qxd5**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Qd8**

**8.Bg5**

**8...h6**

The most natural reaction, forcing us to give up our bishop immediately.

**9.Bxf6 Qxf6 10.Nbd2**

Why is this interesting for us? There are a few reasons. The pawn on e5 is somewhat vulnerable, and easy for us to put pressure on, especially as the move ...f6 would weaken the light squares terribly. Secondly, the queen is slightly misplaced on f6 and vulnerable to attacks with Ne4. Thirdly, Black has no clear target themselves, as we lack weaknesses. Long term, apart from the pressure on the e5-pawn, we will grab space on the queenside. Another potential maneuver is Bd5 followed by Nc4, but it depends on what Black is doing.

**10...Bf5**

Intending to castle long is a double-edged way of playing, but our attack comes very fast.

**11.Ne4 Bxe4 12.dxe4**

This shows one of the reasons the position , in general, is promising for us. Our pawn on c3 controls some dark squares and dominates the c6-knight, making both our light pieces better than Black's. That gives us a significant strategic edge here.

### (561) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd8 #

**7.Bc4**

**7...Qd8**

**8.Bg5**

**8...h6**

**9.Bxf6 Qxf6 10.Nbd2**

**10...Bf5**

**11.Ne4 Qe7 12.b4**

Starting the attack.

**12...Bb6 13.O-O O-O-O 14.Qb3**

Stepping out of the pin on the d-file, putting pressure on f7. Both 14.Qe2 and 14.Qc2 are reasonable alternatives.

**14...Bg4**

A smart intermediate move, forcing us back.

**15.Ned2 f6 16.Rfe1**

Activating the rook, making sure no ...e4-breaks are ever possible and hinting at the possibility of d4 at an appropriate moment. Next up we are ready for continued queenside aggression with a4. Black's attack looks slower than ours, especially as the bishop on b6 will be vulnerable.

### (562) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd8 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**7...Qd8**

**8.Bg5**

**8...h6**

**9.Bxf6 Qxf6 10.Nbd2**

**10...O-O 11.O-O Bb6 12.Re1 Bg4**

is nothing to be worried about, as Black has no way to make use of the pin.

**13.h3 Bh5 14.Bd5**

is a nice maneuver, intending Qa4 or Nc4.

### (563) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd8 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**8.Bg5**

**8...h6**

**9.Bxf6 Qxf6 10.Nbd2**

**10...O-O 11.O-O Bd6 12.Re1**

Intending b4, a4-a5 etc.

**12...Be6**

Does not solve Black's problems.

**13.a4 Bxc4 14.Nxc4**

We keep a nagging pressure on the queenside.

### (564) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...d5**

**6.exd5 Qxd5**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Qd6**

The best move in this move order.

**8.Nbd2**

8.Bg5 e4! now works well for Black.

**8...Bf5**

This is a very serious attempt at forcing further liquidation, and was the choice of Vidit against me.

**9.b4 Bb6 10.Ng5**

Necessary, but also a good moment for this, as after a later Ne4 and dxe4, we get a tempo on the f5-bishop. 10.Qe2 O-O-O would be a disaster, as we have no good way of defending d3. The problem is that 11.Ne4 is met by 11...Nxe4 12.dxe4 Bxe4! 13.Qxe4 Qd1 mate!

**10...O-O 11.Nde4**

This is the point! It turns out that the bishop on f5 is a bit vulnerable.

**11...Qe7 12.Qf3**

Now giving up the light-squared bishop would be very sad, but the alternative is even worse:

**12...Bg6 13.h4**

intending h5, with a huge attack!

### (565) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...d5**

**6.exd5 Qxd5**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Qd6**

**8.Nbd2**

**8...Bf5**

**9.b4 Bb6 10.Ng5**

**10...O-O 11.Nde4**

**11...Nxe4**

Forcing an ending.

**12.dxe4 Qxd1+ 13.Kxd1**

We have an ending. It might look dry, but is in fact quite sharp. Both Bb6 and Nc6 are poorly placed, which means that Black is in need of concrete counterplay.

**13...Bg6 14.h4 h5**

14...h6 15.h5 Bh7 16.Nxh7 Kxh7 is also trouble for Black given White's bishop pair and very active pieces. The White King in turn would be surprisingly safe on c2.

**15.f3**

Thi@ is just a very pleasant edge for us, as all 3 (!) of Black's light pieces are out of play.

### (566) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Qd6**

**8.Nbd2**

**8...Bf5**

**9.b4 Bb6 10.Ng5**

**10...O-O 11.Nde4**

**11...Nxe4**

**12.dxe4 Qxd1+ 13.Kxd1**

**13...Bg4+**

Without a doubt the best move.

**14.Kc2**

Against Vidit I played 14.f3 , but after 14...Bd7 followed by h6 the knight on g5 turned out to be a bit stupid. Therefore I instead suggest this interesting pawn sac.

**14...Bxf2**

The pawn is poisoned, but a slow move like 14...a6 does not make sense either, as we are in time to consolidate with 15.Rf1 simply defending f2. Now our knight can always retreat to f3 if necessary.

**15.Rf1**

Wins the f7-pawn with devastating effect.

### (567) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**11...Nxe4**

**12.dxe4 Qxd1+ 13.Kxd1**

**13...Bg4+**

**14.Kc2**

**14...h6**

Black can't take thepoisoned f2-pawn, so this is probably the best option.

**15.Nf3 Bxf3 16.gxf3**

This would have been a problematic structure if Black's knight or bishop were on f4, but now we will easily be able to push f4 whenever we want.

### (568) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**11...Nxe4**

**12.dxe4 Qxd1+ 13.Kxd1**

**13...Bg4+**

**14.Kc2**

**14...h6**

**15.Nf3 Bxf2**

Again the only move that makes sense. Black needs a pawn in return for the suffering.

**16.Rf1 Bxf3 17.gxf3 Bh4**

Black intends ...Bg5, but isn't really in time.

**18.Rg1 Kh7 19.Be3**

Black does have an extra pawn and the bishop is no longer awkwardly placed on b6, but we do have a lot of compensation. Our light-squared bishop is very powerful, we have a possible entry square for a rook on d7 and the old idea of a4-a5-a6 is still highly relevant.

### (569) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8

**13...Bg4+**

**14.Kc2**

**14...h6**

**15.Nf3 Bxf2**

**16.Rf1 Bb6 17.a4**

Gaining space and preparing a nice square for the bishop on a3.

**17...a5 18.b5 Nd8 19.Nxe5**

wins back the pawn with a continuous initiative.

### (570) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**14.Kc2**

**14...h6**

**15.Nf3 Bxf2**

**16.Rf1 Bb6 17.a4**

**17...a6 18.Nh4**

Opening up the f-file, and intending to go Nf5 at an appropriate moment. Black's lack of active ideas is really what makes this position so unpleasant. 18.h3 Bd7 19.Ba3 is another promising direction.

**18...Be6 19.Bxe6**

settles Black with a not so impressive doubled pawn.

**19...fxe6 20.Nf3**

The doubled pawn in itself is not the problem, but it means that Black struggles to defend e5, which makes the c6-knight stuck. We have plenty of time, and can for example go for an idea like Bd2, hinting at the b5-break. Even trading the rooks will be scary for Black, as the problem of Bb6 and Nc6 won't go away.

### (571) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8

**14...h6**

**15.Nf3 Bxf2**

**16.Rf1 Bb6 17.a4**

**17...a6 18.Nh4**

**18...Ne7**

Black improves the knight, making use of the fact that we no longer attack e5.

**19.a5**

Gaining even more space.

**19...Ba7 20.Ba3**

The a3-f8 diagonal is very scary for Black, as the rook will have to stay on f8 due to the weakness on f7.

**20...b5 21.axb6 Bxb6**

Gives Black more breathing room, but makes the a6-pawn vulnerable.

**22.Nf5 Bxf5 23.exf5**

gives us plenty of compensation as the pawn on a6 is weak and f6 is hard to stop.

### (572) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8

**19...Ba7 20.Ba3**

**20...Bd7**

Intending to sacrifice an exchange in case we play b5, and otherwise trade bishops with ...Bb5.

**21.Bb3**

Simply avoiding the bishop trade, and preparing b5 without the bishop hanging after axb5. The position is very, very unpleasant for Black to play. A very nice line that shows just how risky it all is for Black is

**21...Bb5**

is a better move, but something like

**22.c4 Bc6 23.Rae1 Rae8 24.Nf3**

leaves us with great compensation as b5 will always be in the air, but also just slower play with h4-h5 is very unpleasant to face. The black pieces are simply way too passive.

### (573) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8

**20...Bd7**

**21.Bb3**

Making the a7-bishop even worse, and preventing a later ...c5.

**24...cxb6 25.Rae1**

We are 3 pawns down, but close to winning! After the bishop moves, we capture on e5 and the e7-knight will fall.

**25...Bd3 26.Rf3 e4 27.Rxd3 exd3 28.Bxe7**

will leave us a piece up in the end, as the f8-rook won't escape.

### (574) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8

**5...d5**

**6.exd5 Qxd5**

**7...Qd6**

**8.Nbd2**

**8...Bb6 9.b4**

And Black must play either ...Bf5 or O-O, both immediately transposing.

**5...d5**

**6.exd5 Qxd5**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Qd6**

**8.Nbd2**

**8...O-O 9.b4**

An important part of our plan. We grab space on the queenside, but also introduce the later idea of Ba3, creating unpleasant threats along the diagonal.

**9...Bb6 10.O-O**

The most common-sense move. The very direct 10.a4 has been tried quite a bit at top level, but the lines stretch deep into the ending and tend to be quite drawish. 10.O-O has also been played a fair bit, but it certainly leaves much more room for playing on our own.

**10...Bf5**

The only reasonable move. Black needs to do something before we are in time for a4-a5.

**11.Qc2 a5**

is a less flexible move order.

**12.b5 Ne7 13.Nh4**

kicks the bishop away from the attack on the d3-pawn.

**13...Bd7 14.a4**

This is quite similar to 11...Rad8, but simply a worse version for Black. Our knight is not so bad on h4 whereas Black's bishop on d7 means that there is no counterplay towards d3. We play similarly to the mainline, with Ba3, Rfe1 and pressure on e5.

### (576) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8

**8.Nbd2**

**8...O-O 9.b4**

**9...Bb6 10.O-O**

**10...Bf5**

**11.Qc2 Rad8**

Exactly the same as on the previous move - Black needs to force the play before getting rolled over on the queenside.

**12.a4 a6 13.Ba3**

Wins material, as Black isn't in time to save everything on the diagonal. If you strongly believe in Black's drawing chances in the ending, it's also possible to keep a middlegame character with 13.a5 Ba7 14.Ne4 , with a slight edge.

**13...Bxd3**

The best try, sacrificing an exchange.

**14.Bxd3 Qxd3 15.Qxd3 Rxd3 16.b5 Na5 17.Bxf8 Kxf8 18.Rae1**

Gives Black one pawn and some drawing chances for the exchange, but it's a very long way until a potential draw here.

**10...Bf5**

**11.Qc2 Rad8**

**12.a4 a5**

The only good move for Black.

**13.b5 Nb8**

is a worse square for the knight.

**14.Ba3 Bc5 15.Bxc5 Qxc5 16.Rfe1 Nbd7 17.Nh4**

was played in Caruana-Grischuk, 2017. Black has to give up their bishop, leaving us with a pleasant edge.

**10...Bf5**

**11.Qc2 Rad8**

**12.a4 a5**

**13.b5 Ne7**

The best move. Black is putting the knight on g6, from where it will both protect the e5-weakness and can become active on f4 later on. An important tabiya has arisen. We have gained space on the queenside, but Black has managed to block it and for the moment we can't make further progress there. In the centre the pawn on e5 is more of a target than our d3-pawn, but still Black will be able to defend it reasonably comfortably with ...Ng6. Furthermore, we have some pressure on the a2-g8 diagonal, which is actually quite unpleasant for Black.

**14.Qa2**

Increasing the pressure on the a2-g8 diagonal, making sure the rook can't leave f8. At the same time, we are setting a small trap. 14.Qb3 is another move with very similar ideas, but I like to keep the option of Bb3 and Nc4 in some positions.

**14...Bxd3**

Looks very tempting but works out badly.

**15.Ba3 Qd7 16.Bxd3 Qxd3 17.Bxe7**

just wins a piece.

The only move.

**16.Bxd3 Bxa3**

It looks like all is well for Black, as our d3-bishop is hanging, but this is not so.

**17.Bc2 Bc5 18.Nc4**

The point. Now too many of Black's pawns are hanging.

**18...Qe6 19.Nxa5 Qxa2 20.Rxa2**

Due to the double threat, we emerge with an extra pawn in the ending.

Protecting e5 and getting the knight out of the firing line.

**15.Ba3**

Developing with tempo.

**15...Bc5 16.Bxc5 Qxc5 17.d4 Qd6 18.Rfe1 Rde8**

Trying to keep the e5-pawn alive, but it looks quite clumsy for Black.

**19.g3**

One of many possible moves. We take the f4-square under control and create luft for our king. It's not so easy for Black to keep the tension now, and the most likely scenario is that they have to take on d4 in a worse version than the mainline.

**19...e4**

This is trying to avoid exd4, but it looks very shaky.

**20.Ng5**

Now ...Qf4 is never possible, which is a good benefit of 19.g3.

**20...Re7 21.f3**

Utilizing that Black is a bit overextended.

**21...exf3 22.Ndxf3**

Back is suffering greatly from the weak f7-pawn.

17...Qd6 18.Rfe1 exd4 19.cxd4 reaches the same position.

**18.cxd4 Qd6 19.Rfe1**

The position has stabilized. We have an isolated pawn on d4, but it is very hard for Black to ever attack it. As compensation, we have a good square on e5 for a knight, and control over the e-file. It's not so easy for Black to fight back on the e-file, due to the eternal weakness on f7. Another point of annoyance for Black is the backward c7-pawn, which we can begin to put pressure on with Rac1 next. Another interesting idea is play Bb3, in order to have Nc4 later on. Black is likely OK with perfect play, but it's definitely easier for White to play. I once had a similar position against Eljanov and got very close to winning.

### (582) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

This move order should be preferred by Black if they want their queen on d8 rather than d6.

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd6**

This works less well here, but was tried by Karjakin once.

**9.b4 Bb6 10.Ba3**

Is a very nice extra option we have due to Black having castled too early. Without a rook on f8 this would not have made much sense. Of course, 10.Nbd2 transposing to 5...d5 lines is also perfectly possible.

**10...Ne7**

Karjakin's move, stepping out of the b5-threat.

**11.Nbd2 Bf5 12.Qb3**

Is basically a tempo up compared to previous lines, as we didn't have to play a4.

### (583) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd6**

**9.b4 Bb6 10.Ba3**

**10...Ne7**

**11.Nbd2 a5 12.Qa4**

is a nice additional possibility here.

**12...axb4 13.Qxa8 bxa3 14.Qa4**

does not give Black enough compensation for the exchange, as our rooks have plenty of open files to work on.

### (584) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

This looks passive, but is in fact quite smart. Black does not step into the problematic a3-f8 diagonal and keeps the option of retreating the c5-bishop to d6 or e7.

**9.Nbd2**

Set@ling for calm development. The position is now very positional and strategic. Black is certainly solid, but we also have plenty of ideas. One of the main ideas it to put a knight on e4, and if Black takes, then the advantage of the pawn on c3 vs the knight on c6 gives us a slight initative. Another long term plan is to move the knight over to the kingside and initiate some play there, sometimes even with the help of the g-pawn. Furthermore, grabbing space on the queenside is always an idea, although Black has ways to stop it. 9.Bg5 is not the same as after 5...d5, as Black has the very strong pawn sacrifice 9...e4! 10.Bxf6 Qxf6 11.dxe4 Bg4 . Black gets very active bishops and easy play for the pawn, and practically very easy play. 9.b4 is another tempting move, but here it is met by 9...Be7! keeping the d-file open. Next Black plays ...Bf5, Qd7 and puts pressure on the d3-pawn.<level start="5...d5"/>

**9...h6**

This is a normal move in the structure, but here it looks a little bit slow.

**10.b4**

Immediately grabbing space.

**10...Be7**

Works less well here, as we are in time to attack e5 before d3 falls.

**11.Re1 Bf5**

Would have worked if Black didn't waste a move with ...h6.

**12.Nxe5 Nxe5 13.Rxe5 Bxd3**

13...Qd7 , instead, avoids blundering a piece, but leaves us with a healthy extra pawn after 14.Qf3 . Compared to similar positions, here we are not struggling to develop our pieces. For example: 14...Bg6 15.Nb3 , followed by either d4 or Bf4. Black does not have enough compensation for the pawn.

**14.Bxd3 Qxd3 15.Rxe7**

wins a piece.

### (585) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...h6**

**10.b4**

**10...Bd6 11.Re1**

And we follow up with our usual moves, like Qe2, h3, Ne4 etc.

### (586) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...Bf5**

is a popular move, but it commits the bishop to f5 a bit earlier than necessary. If Black later plays ...Re8 and ...Be6, they will have lost a tempo.

**10.Qe2 Bd6 11.Ne4**

is a good antidote, as Black will lose a tempo if they ever take on e4.

**11...h6 12.a4**

Is a typical follow-up, grabbing space.

**12...Re8 13.b4 Be6**

Was actually played in a few games, but makes a strange impression. I included it mainly to show the following idea.

**14.Re1**

Allowing Black to capture on c4! The doubled c-pawns are quite useful here, as the c5-push is unpleasant for Black to face. Next we follow up with moves like a5, h3, and Bd2. Eventually Black will find it difficult to keep the tension, and take on c4. For instance

**14...Qe7 15.a5 a6 16.h3 Rad8 17.Bd2**

and Black is beginning to struggle finding useful waiting moves.

### (587) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...Bf5**

**10.Qe2 Bd6 11.Ne4**

**11...h6 12.a4**

**12...Re8 13.b4 Be6**

**14.Re1**

**14...Bxc4 15.dxc4**

We will follow up with play on both wings. The only danger here is that Black is able to push ...f5, which we must take every precaution to stop.

**15...Nxe4 16.Qxe4 Qd7 17.a5**

Gaining even more space.

**17...a6 18.g4**

Important. It might look risky to weaken our position like this, but with the queen on e4 controlling everything and Black's knight so far away from the kingside it is perfectly safe. Next up we can either play Kh1, Rg1 and try to do something on the g-file, or just Be3, Rad1 and perhaps Rd5, putting pressure in the centre.

### (588) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...a6**

Is another quite solid move. Black is threatening ...b5, so we are forced to commit our pawn to a4.

**10.a4**

10.b4 Be7! would be similar to 9.b4.

**10...h6 11.b4 Ba7**

This looks natural, to keep the bishop on the a7-g1 diagonal, but it also allows us to take control of the a3-f8 diagonal instead.

**12.h3**

Our usual preparatory move.

**12...Bf5 13.Qc2**

Protecting d3, but also keeping the possibility of Qb3 later on. Now we are intending to play Re1 and Ne4, for instance

**13...Re8 14.Re1 Qd7 15.Ne4 Nxe4 16.dxe4 Be6 17.Rd1 Qe7 18.Qb3**

With some pressure. The bishop on a7 looks active, but in reality it is not doing a lot as f2 will never be possible to attack twice. Rather, our bishop coming to a3 next is the more powerful one. After the trade of light-squared bishops, the d5-square will be excellent for our rook.

### (589) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...a6**

**10.a4**

**10...h6 11.b4 Bd6 12.Re1 Re8**

The most natural move after ...h6 is played. Black intends ...Be6 without having lost a move on ...Bf5 earlier on.

**13.Ne4**

Allowing Black the symmetrical structure, but that does not mean that the position is equal.

**13...Nxe4 14.dxe4 a5**

Is an interesting positional concept for Black - they lose some time, but gain a nice square on c5.

**15.b5 Nb8 16.Qb3**

Developing with tempo.

**16...Be6 17.Be3 Nd7 18.Red1**

Intending to double on the d-file, and perhaps later bring the knight via d2 to c4. Black is certainly solid, but we do have the more active position and some potential targets on the queenside.

### (590) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...a6**

**10.a4**

**10...h6 11.b4 Bd6 12.Re1 Re8**

**13.Ne4**

**13...Be6 14.Qe2**

Similar to the line with 9...Bf5, but here Black has an extra tempo due to not having played ... Bf5 first. Still, the position is not supersensitive to tempi, and the play will be similar to what we saw there. For instance

**14...Bxc4 15.dxc4 Nxe4 16.Qxe4 Qd7 17.g4**

Is the same idea, never to allow ... f5. We follow up with Be3 and then either Rad1-d5 or Kh1, Rg1.

### (591) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...a5**

This is the most popular move in correspondence chess, and the recommendation of Jarmula in his Chessable course. Black prevents b4, limiting us to play exclusively on the kingside and in the centre. On the other hand the move ... a5 weakens the b5-square and stops Black from ever pushing ...b5 themselves.

**10.h3**

A small little move, taking the g4-square under control and waiting to see how Black reacts next. We should not commit our pawn to a4 yet, as it would lose a lot of flexibility.

**10...a4**

Grabs further space, but not really contributing to the fight for the centre.

**11.Re1 Qd6 12.Qe2 Bf5 13.Ng5**

Is again an interesting reply, intending Nde4.

**13...h6 14.Nde4 Qe7 15.Qf3**

is similar. Black will have to give up the light-squared bishop, giving us good long-term prospects with the bishop pair.

### (592) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...a5**

**10.h3**

**10...a4**

**11.Re1 Qd6 12.Qe2 Bf5 13.Ng5**

**13...h6 14.Nde4 Bxe4 15.Nxe4 Nxe4 16.dxe4**

This is a sort of position we are happy to get in this line. It is not much, but it is definitely something. Black is solid, but the bishop pair will be an asset for a very, very, long time.

### (593) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...a5**

**10.h3**

**10...Bf5 11.Qe2 Bd6 12.Ne4**

Is again fairly pleasant for us.

**12...h6 13.g4**

is a very interesting way of fighting for the initiative. We have a lot of pieces on the kingside so there is very little risk of getting punished, while we have some play of our own with Kh1, Rg1 and then either a g5-push or the maneuver Nh4-f5.

### (594) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...a5**

**10.h3**

**10...h6**

A typical useful move, preventing Ng5 which makes ... Re8 a possible move later on.

**11.Re1 Re8 12.Bb5**

is a little unpleasant, as e5 is weak.

### (595) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...a5**

**10.h3**

**10...h6**

**11.Re1 Qd6**

Simply protecting e5.

**12.Qe2 Re8**

is very risky before Black have connected their rooks.

**13.d4 exd4 14.Qxe8+ Nxe8 15.Rxe8+ Kh7 16.Ne4**

gives us a very promising initiative for the queen

**16...Qd7 17.Bd3**

is the point.

**17...f5**

The only move to keep the queen alive

**18.Rxc8 Qxc8 19.Nxc5**

We have 3 good pieces for the queen and pawn, something that almost always favours the pieces. I see no reason for this position to be an exception and would thoroughly enjoy playing White.

### (596) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...a5**

**10.h3**

**10...h6**

**11.Re1 Qd6**

**12.Qe2 Bf5**

12...Be6 13.Nxe5 just picks up a pawn.

**13.Nf1**

Intending Ng3 - a logical reaction against ...Bf5.

**13...Rfe8 14.Ng3 Bh7**

14...Be6 15.Bb5!? is still a bit unpleasant for Black. 14...Bg6 15.Nh4 intending Ngf5 and Qf3 creates some tension around the Black's kingside.

**15.Nd2**

Intending Nde4 and dxe4, after which the h7-bishop looks offside. Later on, we will be able to build slowly on the kingside.

### (597) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...Be7 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

Delaying ... d6 must always be treated carefully in the Ruy Lopez. Black gains two main things from it: one is that the move ...d5 can later be played in one go, the other that the c5-bishop can still retreat to e7 or f8, if necessary.

**7.Bg5**

Intended to stop ...d5. Usually, we are a bit hesitant to place our bishop on g5 this early, but it makes some additional sense after ...Re8. If Black pushes 8...h6 9.Bh4 g5 , then the rook would be better placed on f8 to support a later ...f5-break. Thinking even further ahead, if after 10.Bg3 Black goes Nh5-Nxg3 hunting down our bishop, then after fxg3 the f7-pawn is weaker! This sounds a bit far-fetched, but it is surprisingly relevant for the evaluation of the move ...Re8.7.Re1 would not be as good here, due to 7...a6 8.Ba4 d5! gaining counterplay in the centre.<skip/>

**7...a6**

As usual a good move to flick in when we are not taking on c6.

**8.Ba4**

Now Black has two main ways of playing: either pushing h6 and g5, which is the sharpest, or play ...Be7, which is the solid option.

**8...Be7**

Black opts for the solid option. It does lose a tempo, but in the closed structure that arises that is not such a big problem. The potential trade of dark-squared bishops is beneficial for Black as they lack space.

**9.Nbd2**

Continuing with our development. We don't want to commit our rook to e1 yet, as the f-file might open later.

**9...d6 10.h3 Nh5 11.Be3**

leaves the knight doing nothing on h5.

### (598) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...Be7 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**7.Bg5**

**7...a6**

**8.Ba4**

**8...Be7**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...d6 10.h3 h6**

The typical reaction from Black, and the continuation of the strategy started with 8...Be7.

**11.Bh4 Nh5 12.Bg3**

This is what it's all about! Trading on e7 would have led to a very dry position, in which Black is supersolid. By playing Bg3 we are ready to give up the bishop pair, but as so often in the Ruy Lopez, it is not necessarily a good thing for Black to take. The f7-pawn is a bit weak and the light squares are soft. Meanwhile, the position is blocked, making our knights at least as useful as Black's bishops.

**12...Bg5**

In fact, this is the most typical reaction from Black. As our bishop is relatively passive on g3 Black sees no great need to take it just yet.

**13.Re1**

Giving Black a second chance to capture on g3.13.Nxg5 Qxg5 14.Nf3 is also very reasonable, but as we have traded off a supporter for the d4-break we are increasing the risk of our dark-squared bishop becoming out of play.

**13...Qf6 14.Nxg5**

Now we have won a free tempo.

**14...Qxg5 15.Kh2**

Protecting g3. Now we are intending Nf3 followed by d4.

### (599) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...Be7 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...d6 10.h3 h6**

**11.Bh4 Nh5 12.Bg3**

**12...Bg5**

**13.Re1**

**13...Nxg3 14.fxg3**

The play is similar to the immediate 12...Nxg3 13.fxg3. Our rook would be a bit better placed on the open f-file, but on the other hand, the g5-bishop is slightly vulnerable. An additional possibility that makes sense here is the maneuver Nf1-e3-d5, as the f1-square is free. Yes, Black has the bishop pair, but the light squares, the f-file and especially the fact that Black struggles to find an active plan of their own means that we should be happy.

### (600) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...Be7 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**7.Bg5**

**7...a6**

**8.Ba4**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...d6 10.h3 h6**

**11.Bh4 Nh5 12.Bg3**

**12...Nxg3 13.fxg3**

is strategically interesting. We are intending to play Bb3, putting pressure on f7. Playing Qe2 and doubling the rooks on the f-file also makes sense. At an appropriate moment even d4 can be considered, especially if there is a Black bishop on e6.

**13...Bf6**

does not block the f-file forever, as we have both Nh2-g4 and Nc4-e3-d5 as later options.

**14.Qe2**

followed by Rf2 and Raf1 is promising for us.

### (601) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...Be7 #5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**9...d6 10.h3 h6**

**11.Bh4 Nh5 12.Bg3**

**12...Nxg3 13.fxg3**

**13...Be6 14.d4**

A concrete reaction against ...Be6. Slower play with 14.Qe2 or 14.Kh1 is also possible.

**14...exd4 15.cxd4 d5 16.e5**

would be very good for us - Black's c6-knight prevents counterplay with ...c5, and we can just build up on the kingside.

### (602) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...Be7 #6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**7.Bg5**

**12...Nxg3 13.fxg3**

**13...Be6 14.d4**

**14...exd4 15.cxd4 b5 16.Bc2 Bd7**

Forced.

**17.Kh2**

A good prophylactic move, making sure d4 is not hanging with check.

**17...Bf6 18.Bb3**

Is the point. With the king on g1 Black would now have been able to capture on d4.

**18...Rf8**

Necessary, to protect f7.

**19.Nb1**

An interesting maneuver, intending Nc3-d5. We have the d4-pawn safely protected and with the knight coming to d5, potential for initiative. Black does still have the bishop pair and a solid position, but to my eyes, the position looks a lot easier for White to play.

### (603) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**7.Bg5**

**7...a6**

**8.Ba4**

**8...h6**

The most normal reaction after Bg5. Black forces us to choose the direction of the bishop.

**9.Bh4**

The most reasonable continuation, but it should be noted that from now on Black always has the option of ...g5, when our bishop might get out of play on g3. Still, ...g5 is also a pretty serious weakening move, so it is generally not something we should fear.

**9...Be7 10.Nbd2 d6 11.h3**

Transposes to 8...Be7 9.Nbd2 d6 10.h3 h6 11.Bh4.

### (604) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 b5 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**7.Bg5**

**7...a6**

**8.Ba4**

**8...h6**

**9.Bh4**

**9...b5**

This is an important position, as we are breaking our rule here!

**10.Bb3**

Having played c3, we normally retreat the bishop all the way to c2, but here we need to think back to move 6, where Black by 6...Re8 kept the possibility of playing ...d5 in one move. Therefore, we now need to fight against the d5-idea, meaning that our bishop is better placed on b3.10.Bc2 g5 11.Bg3 d5 is OK for Black.<level start="6...Re8"/>

**10...g5 11.Bg3 d5**

With the bishop on b3, we are much better placed for this now.

**12.exd5 Nxd5**

With the bishop on c2 Black would have preferred to take with the queen on d4, but here it obviously isn't possible.

**13.Nbd2**

Black is overextended. A well-timed d4-break will likely make Black's position collapse soon.

### (605) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 b5 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**7.Bg5**

**7...a6**

**8.Ba4**

**8...h6**

**9.Bh4**

**9...b5**

**10.Bb3**

**10...Be7 11.a4**

An idea well known to us from the 6.d3 b5 Spanish, and a good moment for it here as well.<skip/>

**11...b4 12.a5**

With very similar play to what we have seen before. The bishop on h4 makes a slight difference, but if anything it's slightly better there than on c1. Next we play Nbd2-c4, and can then slowly begin to prepare d4 with moves like Re1 and h3.

### (606) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 g5 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**7.Bg5**

**7...a6**

**8.Ba4**

**8...h6**

**9.Bh4**

**9...g5**

As usual in lines with Bg5, this is the most critical reaction. Without Black having played ...d6 we can never even think about sacrificing on g5, as Black will have ...Be7 afterwards.

**10.Bg3 d6**

The@position is double-edged, and quite similar to the Ruy Lopez lines with 5.d3 b5 6.Bb3 Bc5 7.Bg5. There are some differences though. First, we have already castled. Secondly, Black has spent a move on ...Re8, which is not at all clearly a better square than f8 (remember, one of Black's main plans is to push ...f5). The 3rd and perhaps most important difference though, is that Black hasn't yet committed to ...b5, which means that we don't have our usual target to attack with a4, etc. Instead, our play is now almost exclusively aimed at the centre and the kingside. A well-timed d4-push, but also the maneuver Nbd2-f1-e3, perhaps followed up by h4!?.<skip/>

**11.Re1 Ba7**

We have seen this numerous times before. Black steps out of the d4-threat.

**12.Nbd2 Ne7**

would be the most typical maneuver, but isn't possible here.

**13.Bxe8**

Another disadvantage of the 'extra' move ...Re8.

### (607) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 g5 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**7.Bg5**

**7...a6**

**8.Ba4**

**8...h6**

**9.Bh4**

**9...g5**

**10.Bg3 d6**

**11.Re1 Ba7**

**12.Nbd2 Nh7**

The most active move. Black is looking for counterplay with ...h5-h4. Now play gets very sharp, as we need to act forcefully so as not to get rolled over by Black's pawns.

**13.Nf1**

Bringing the knight towards e3.

**13...h5 14.h4**

This is very important. By playing h4 we force Black to block the kingside, after which we can again focus on the centre. The downside is that our f3-knight is kicked back and that the h4-pawn is weak, but we are ready to sacrifice the pawn in order to get play in the centre.

**14...Bg4 15.N1h2**

Shows why the knight maneuver is so important.

### (608) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 g5 #3

**11.Re1 Ba7**

**12.Nbd2 Nh7**

**13.Nf1**

**13...h5 14.h4**

**14...g4 15.N3h2**

The knight is bad on h2, but we do have a straightforward plan of getting play in the centre.

**15...Qf6**

Just developing like this is possible, but a bit slow.

**16.Ne3 Be6 17.Qd2**

Continuing with our plan. Next, we go Rad1 after which d4 will come soon. An additional possibility against the queen on f6 could be to play for the f3-break, but for now there is no need as d4 is good enough.

### (609) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 g5 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**12.Nbd2 Nh7**

**13.Nf1**

**13...h5 14.h4**

**14...g4 15.N3h2**

**15...Nf8**

The best move! Black immediately goes for our h4-pawn.

**16.Qd2 Ng6**

would be a huge mistake

**17.Qh6**

suddenly Black can't defend h5

### (610) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 g5 #5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**14...g4 15.N3h2**

**15...Nf8**

**16.Qd2 Kg7**

Absolutely necessary.

**17.Rad1 Ng6**

As I warned you before, we can't defend our h4-pawn.

**18.d4**

Both sides have achieved their aim. Black can pick up the h4-pawn in numerous ways, but we are content with the counterplay we have obtained in the centre. Black needs to do something about the e5-pawn, after which one of many interesting options for us is Ne3-f5, perhaps followed by f3. It is very difficult to predict what exactly will happen from here on, but I will show a few lines to illustrate how the game might develop.

**18...Bd7 19.Bxc6**

Giving up the bishop to relieve the pressure on the d4-pawn.

**19...bxc6 20.Kh1**

Intending to push f3, opening up the f- or even the g-file. Black can still pick up a pawn on h4, but the extra pawn is not felt at all once we begin our attack. It is still quite a messy position, but I believe it's much easier for White to play.

### (611) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 g5 #6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**16.Qd2 Kg7**

**17.Rad1 Ng6**

**18.d4**

**18...exd4 19.Bxc6 bxc6 20.cxd4 Nxh4**

A straightforward and logical way for Black to play.

**21.Bf4**

An important move, freeing up the g3-square for the knight and activating the bishop.

**21...Ng6 22.Bh6+ Kh7 23.Qc1**

This is the last critical move for us. We have to stop ...Bxd4, which can now safely be captured by the rook. Next up we can play Ng3-h5, after which Black's king will be very weak.

**23...h4**

It is important that Black should not really try to stop our knight with this move as we have a strong follow-up.

**24.Ne3**

Black covered g3, but the e3-square will do just fine for the knight too!

**24...Rxe4**

24...Kxh6?? 25.Nf5+ and Qh6-Qh7 is mate in two.

**25.Qxc6**

Attacks both rooks! We have frequently seen a similar tactic against knights on c6 and e4, but the double attack against the rooks is of course as effective as against the knights!

### (612) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 g5 #7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**21.Bf4**

**21...Ng6 22.Bh6+ Kh7 23.Qc1**

**23...h4**

**24.Ne3**

**24...g3**

is the only move, but every pawn move on the kingside is more likely to make Black's king weaker rather than giving counterplay, as we have so many pieces around the kingside.

**25.fxg3 hxg3 26.Nf3**

Intending Nf5, with an ongoing attack. The bishop on h6 is still immune due to the same reasons as on move 24.

### (613) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...a6 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

Black's most popular move. The move d6 indicates that Black is ready to just develop their pieces and start to play chess. Now there are a lot of possible moves for both sides, but even so, the position is one more about understanding than about specifics. In order to really fight for an edge, though, we should pay attention to some move orders here.

**7.Re1**

Highly controversial, and pretty rare. The move Re1 in this structure is of course a very logical and normal one, but here specifically it is a little bit rare. In my opinion, it is one of the most ambitious, though. We are protecting e4, making it possible to push d4, but for the time being not committing to h3 or Nbd2, which are the two other natural moves. After 7.h3 I don't particularly like facing the continuation 7...Ne7! intending to push c6 and d5. After 8.d4 Bb6 the game usually continues 9.Bd3 d5 10.Nxe5 Nxe4 , and this position is a bit too dry to my taste.

**7...a6**

This is another popular move after 7.h3, but here we can again make use of the tempo gained by executing another really interesting idea.

**8.Bxc6**

Usually we don't want to give up our proud light-squared bishop, but we have a specific follow-up in mind.

**8...bxc6 9.Bg5**

This is the idea. Normally this pin is not particularly worrisome, but here the move Re1 is very useful, as our main idea is still to push d4. The direct 9.d4 Bb6 10.Bg5 is also interesting.

**9...h6 10.Bh4 Bb6**

We have seen this prophylactic retreat in a few other similar positions. Black steps out of d4 with tempo.

**11.Nbd2 g5**

Sooner or later this is obligatory, as Black can't tolerate the pin forever.

**12.Bg3 c5**

Trying to prevent us from playing d4...

**13.d4**

But we do it anyway. This kind of sacrifice is quite common after Black has played the weakening ...g5 move.

**13...cxd4 14.cxd4 exd4 15.Nc4 Bc5 16.Nxd4**

This wins back the pawn with a continuous initiative.

### (614) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...a6 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...a6**

**8.Bxc6**

**8...bxc6 9.Bg5**

**9...h6 10.Bh4 g5**

The most critical response.

**11.Bg3 g4**

Another typical reaction. Black forces the knight to h4, where it runs the risk of being out of play.

**12.Nh4**

12.d4 is sharper and more double-edged.

**12...Nh5 13.Nd2 Qf6**

Is the typical follow-up. Black is fighting for the squares on the kingside.

**14.Rf1**

Looks interesting for White. We intend Nc4-e3, and if Black takes the e3-knight, then we get play on the f-file. Meanwhile, it is not entirely clear how Black is intending to create counterplay with the kingside blocked.

### (615) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...a6 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...a6**

**8.Bxc6**

**8...bxc6 9.Bg5**

**9...h6 10.Bh4 g5**

**11.Bg3 Bg4**

A normal move. The bishop is trying to cover the weaknesses on the kingside, at the same time creating an unpleasant pin on our f3-knight.

**12.Nbd2 Re8**

A slower much such as this allows us to execute our idea:

**13.h3 Bh5 14.Qa4 Qd7 15.d4**

And now Black has to give up the centre, as both e5 and c5 are attacked.

**15...exd4 16.cxd4**

We are happy having provoked exd4.

### (616) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...a6 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...a6**

**8.Bxc6**

**8...bxc6 9.Bg5**

**9...h6 10.Bh4 g5**

**11.Bg3 Bg4**

**12.Nbd2 Ba7**

Funnily enough, this is often a worse square than b6 for a surprising reason.

**13.h3 Bh5 14.Qa4 c5 15.Qxa6**

With the bishop on b6, the a6-pawn would have been defended!

### (617) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...a6 #5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...a6**

**8.Bxc6**

**8...bxc6 9.Bg5**

**9...h6 10.Bh4 g5**

**11.Bg3 Bg4**

**12.Nbd2 Bb6**

Again important prophylaxis from Black.

**13.Nc4 Re8**

Aimed at our d4, as the e4-pawn comes under pressure.

**14.d4**

The most direct way. Slower moves are also possible and lead to an interesting strategic battle.

**14...exd4 15.Nxb6**

To be able to recapture with the queen on d4.

**15...cxb6 16.Qxd4 c5 17.Qd3 d5 18.e5 Ne4 19.Rad1**

Activates the rook and puts some pressure on the centre. One thing to note is that after

**19...Qd7**

It does not really lead anywhere to take on d5, so we should rather play something like h3 intending h4.

**20.h3 Bf5 21.Qe3**

With some play against Black's king.

### (618) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...a6 #6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...a6**

**8.Bxc6**

**8...bxc6 9.Bg5**

**9...h6 10.Bh4 g5**

**11.Bg3 Bg4**

**12.Nbd2 Bb6**

**13.Nc4 Re8**

**14.d4**

**14...exd4 15.Nxb6**

**15...cxb6 16.Qxd4 Bxf3**

Forces an ugly doubled pawn, but removes a kingside defender.

**17.gxf3 d5 18.exd5 Rxe1+ 19.Rxe1 Nxd5 20.h4**

We are enjoying some initiative against Black's king, especially as the a8-rook is not yet in the game.

### (619) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 a6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

A very logical move, played in the same style as against 7.h3. Black intends to play c6 and d5 as quickly as possible, and the knight will find an excellent square on g6.

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

An interesting way of making use of the tempo gained by omitting h3.

**9...a6**

This is slightly strange, as it does not mix well with the idea of Ne7 and c6.

**10.Bf1 exd4**

would give Black counterplay against our centre without a4 a6 included, but here we have an extra option.

**11.cxd4 Bg4**

This puts pressure on d4, but we can protect it by the very smart a5.

**12.a5 Ba7 13.Ra4**

Now the d4-pawn is safe. Next, we can follow up with natural developing moves like Nc3. Black looks active, but with our centre secured the Black activity will evaporate bit by bit.

### (620) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 a5 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...a5**

This makes some sense, but the inclusion of a4 a5 favours White for two reasons: the bishop is more vulnerable on b6, and our rook can be brought into the game via a3.

**10.Nbd2 Ng6 11.h3 c6 12.Bd3**

Intending Nf1-g3, looks quite pleasant for White.

### (621) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 a5 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...a5**

**10.Nbd2 exd4 11.cxd4 Bg4**

This is often an interesting reaction from Black in these positions, but it works less well with a4 a5 included.

**12.h3 Bh5 13.e5 dxe5 14.dxe5 Nfd5 15.Ne4**

Just gives us a nice initiative for free.

### (622) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 a5 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...a5**

**10.Nbd2 exd4 11.cxd4 Bg4**

**12.h3 Bh5 13.e5 Nfd5 14.exd6 Qxd6 15.Nc4**

This is one of the differences - Black will not be able to recapture on b6 with the a-pawn.

**15...Qd8 16.Nxb6 Nxb6 17.Bd2**

Black is certainly solid, but we do have the two bishops and the a5-pawn will always be a target.

### (623) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

The most logical move, as c6 is anyway part of Black's plan.

**10.Bf1**

In these positions it's always a tough choice where to place the bishop. On d3 it overprotects e4 and is generally a bit more active, but also more vulnerable. It runs into d5 exd5 e4 tactics, and sometimes a knight coming to f4. Here I don't think Black is able to push ...d5 in a good way anyway, so I prefer the bishop on f1.

**10...d5 11.exd5 e4 12.d6**

A typical intermezzo, not allowing Black to support the e4-pawn with cxd5.

**12...Qxd6 13.Ne5**

Our knight on e5 is stable while the pawn on e4 is weak.

### (624) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...exd4**

This is very interesting, and a typical way for Black to play in these positions. The point is that after ...d5 Black will get a very good knight on e4. Still, it's always a strategic risk to give up the centre like this, and I like our chances.

**11.cxd4 d5 12.e5 Ne4 13.Nc3 f5**

Supporting the knight. If it moves we are just better.

**14.exf6**

A simple way to play - the knight has to retreat.

**14...Nxf6 15.a5**

A typical trick we should always keep in mind in these positions - Black can't take it due to the e7-knight hanging: 15...Bxa5?? 16.Rxa5 Qxa5 17.Rxe7 .

**15...Bc7 16.h3**

Preventing ...Bg4. The structure is now very comfortable for us. We have the safer king long-term and a nice outpost on e5. Ne5 is of course a good move, but also Bd3 and Bg5 will increase the pressure.

### (625) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...exd4**

**11.cxd4 Bg4**

Creating some unpleasant pins.

**12.Ra3**

A key resource. The rook will be needed to recapture on f3 without losing the d4-pawn.

**12...Ng6 13.h3 Bxf3 14.Rxf3**

Fancy, but also effective!

**14...d5**

Black has to act quickly, otherwise we are just clearly better with the bishop pair and nice centre.

**15.e5 Ne4 16.g3**

Intending to develop the bishop to g2, at the same time preventing ...Nh4.

**16...c5 17.Nd2 cxd4 18.Nxe4 dxe4 19.Rxe4**

This is very nice for us. The d-pawn is more weak than strong, and we have an excellent square for our bishop on d3.

### (626) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...exd4**

**11.cxd4 Bg4**

**12.Ra3**

**12...Ng6 13.h3 Bxf3 14.Rxf3**

**14...d5**

**15.e5 Ne4 16.g3**

**16...f6 17.exf6 Rxf6 18.Bg2**

Looks quite pleasant for us. The pawn on d4 is isolated, but we have more pawns in front of our king and a potentially strong light-squared bishop. For instance

**18...Qf8 19.Rxf6 Qxf6 20.Bxe4**

This picks up a pawn, which is the point of g3 Bg2!

### (627) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...exd4**

**11.cxd4 Bg4**

**12.Ra3**

**12...Ng6 13.h3 Bxf3 14.Rxf3**

**14...d5**

**15.e5 Ne4 16.g3**

**16...f6 17.exf6 Rxf6 18.Bg2**

**18...Qf8 19.Rxf6 Nxf6 20.Na3**

Intending to put the knight on c2, covering our only weakness on d4. Next, we will slowly activate our bishop pair and enjoy a pleasant ending.

### (628) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...exd4**

**11.cxd4 Bg4**

**12.Ra3**

**12...d5**

Looks tempting to get the knight to e4.

**13.e5 Ne4 14.Nbd2**

Intending to trade the knight.

**14...f5 15.exf6 Nxf6 16.h3 Bh5 17.a5**

Our typical tactical trick, gaining a nice initiative.

**17...Bc7 18.a6 b6 19.g4 Bg6 20.Bg2**

This is just great for us. Next, we play Ne5 followed by f4, with complete dominance of the centre.

### (629) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...exd4**

**11.cxd4 Bg4**

**12.Ra3**

**12...d5**

**13.e5 Ne4 14.Nbd2**

**14...Nxf2**

The most critical move. It looks scary for us, but everything is under control!

**15.Kxf2 Bxd4+ 16.Kg3 Bh5 17.Qc2**

An important move, attacking the d4-bishop, preventing ...Nf5+ and intending Bd3.

**17...Bb6 18.Bd3**

followed by h3 and Kh2, with complete safety.

### (630) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...exd4**

**11.cxd4 Bg4**

**12.Ra3**

**12...Bh5**

Very advanced. Black makes a useful waiting move, intending to get ...d5 followed by ...Ne4 in an improved version.

**13.h3**

In order to break the pin with g4 later. 13.Bg5 d5 14.Bxf6 gxf6 15.Nc3 is a calmer option, which leads to a strategically double-edged position.

**13...d5 14.e5 Ne4**

The inclusion of h3 Bh5 will give Black an additional tempo, as the bishop won't be hanging on g4 later.

**15.Nbd2 Nxf2**

Is again the critical move. 15...f5 16.exf6 Nxf6 17.a5 would transpose to 12...d5.

**16.Kxf2 Bxd4+ 17.Kg3**

The bishop is already on h5, so we don't win a tempo.

**17...Qc7 18.Be2**

Breaking the pin, attacking the d4-bishop.

**18...Bxe5+**

is an error.

**19.Nxe5 Qxe5+**

wins another pawn but lets our king back to complete safety

**20.Kf2**

Here we are just clearly better, as the pawns aren't moving and our pieces will soon become very strong.

### (631) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #9 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...exd4**

**11.cxd4 Bg4**

**12.Ra3**

**12...Bh5**

**13.h3**

**13...d5 14.e5 Ne4**

**15.Nbd2 Nxf2**

**16.Kxf2 Bxd4+ 17.Kg3**

**17...Qc7 18.Be2**

**18...Bc5 19.Rc3**

The position is still very sharp, but I do fancy our extra piece. After 19...Bb4 we can either give black an exchange with 20.Kh2!? or continue a piece up with 20.Rb3 a5 21.Kh2 f6 22.Kg1 , with a continuous mess. If this is too messy for your taste, then 13.Bg5 makes a lot of sense as an alternative.

### (632) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #10 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...Ng6**

Delaying immediate action, just continuing with normal moves.

**11.Nbd2 Re8 12.h3**

Always useful. In the long run it is very rare that we can do without h3, but by delaying it until now we have dissuaded the earlier ...d5-ideas.

**12...h6**

is perfectly natural and I guess quite likely to be played in a game.

**13.Qc2**

Is usually a very good move in these positions. We overprotect the e4-pawn and prepare queenside expansion with b4.

**13...Be6 14.b4**

Continuing to expand. The more modest 14.b3 is also possible.

**14...a5 15.b5 Rc8**

Intends to put some pressure along the c-file, but

**16.bxc6**

is a good reply. After

**16...bxc6**

We are comfortably better in different ways, for instance...

**17.dxe5 Nxe5 18.Nxe5 dxe5 19.Nc4**

This gives us either an excellent knight on c4, or the bishop pair if Black takes it.

### (633) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #11 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...Ng6**

**11.Nbd2 Re8 12.h3**

**12...d5**

The critical test. Black is trying to liquidate everything in the centre.

**13.dxe5 Nxe5 14.exd5 Nxf3+ 15.Nxf3 Rxe1 16.Qxe1 Nxd5 17.a5**

Again a very useful resource.

**17...Bc7 18.Bg5 f6 19.Bd2**

This gives us an excellent initiative with c4 next.

### (634) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #12 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...Ng6**

**11.Nbd2 Re8 12.h3**

**12...d5**

**13.dxe5 Nxe5 14.exd5 Nxf3+ 15.Nxf3 Rxe1 16.Qxe1 Qxd5 17.c4**

17.Bg5 Be6 18.Bxf6 gxf6 19.b4 is also interesting, but probably the bishop pair is just about enough compensation for the weakened kingside.

**17...Qd8 18.a5 Bc7 19.b4**

Intending Bb2 gives us a nice initiative for free.

### (635) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #13 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...Ng6**

**11.Nbd2 Re8 12.h3**

**12...d5**

**13.dxe5 Nxe5 14.exd5 Nxf3+ 15.Nxf3 Rxe1 16.Qxe1 Qxd5 17.c4**

**17...Qe4**

Black needs to stay as active as possible.

**18.a5**

18.Qc3!? keeps the queens on the board and is also an option. 18...Qe7 19.Bd3 intending b3, Bb2 is likely not an edge, but a playable position.

**18...Qxe1 19.Nxe1**

In the ending a draw is of course the favorite result, but we do keep some nagging pressure due to our advanced a-pawn and slight lead in development, for instance

**19...Bc5 20.Nd3 Bd4 21.Bf4**

Possibly followed by c5 and Ra4-b4. The b7-pawn is slightly vulnerable and our pieces slightly more active. It's very little, but not yet a draw.

### (636) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...h6 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 h6**

A slow-looking move, but not without ideas. Black is worried about 7...a6 8.Bxc6 bxc6 9.Bg5 so plays ...h6 first, with the idea of ...a6 on the next move.

**8.h3**

Now that Black has wasted a move on ... h6, the lines with ...Ne7 and a quick ...d5-push aren't really possible anymore. Therefore we can allow ourselves the luxury of including h3 before pushing in the centre.

**8...a6 9.Ba4**

9.Bxc6 is possible, and it could be argued that we have an improved version of similar positions, but simply retreating the bishop goes well with the rest of our repertoire.

**9...Ba7 10.Nbd2**

And this actually leads to our Ruy Lopez 5.d3 Repertoirewith 5...Bc5.<skip/>

### (637) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...h6 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 h6**

**8.h3**

**8...a6 9.Ba4**

**9...b5 10.Bc2**

As usual, we are retreating all the way to c2 once given the chance. Now we will play similarly to our 6.d3 b5 lines, with a4 putting pressure on Black's queenside.<skip/>

**10...Bb6 11.a4**

Is similar to what we have seen many times before in other chapters. For instance

**11...Rb8 12.Na3 b4 13.Nc4**

We will see a similar position in the mainline, in which Black did not waste a tempo on ... Bb6.

### (638) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...h6 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 h6**

**8.h3**

**8...a6 9.Ba4**

**9...b5 10.Bc2**

**10...d5**

Always has to be addressed as soon as we go with our bishop to c2 in one move.

**11.d4**

A very convincing antidote though.

**11...dxe4 12.Nxe5 Nxe5 13.dxe5**

Wins a pawn.

### (639) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...h6 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 h6**

**8.h3**

**8...a6 9.Ba4**

**9...b5 10.Bc2**

**10...Re8**

The most flexible move.

**11.a4 b4 12.d4 Ba7 13.d5**

Picks up the pawn on b4.

### (640) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...h6 #5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 h6**

**8.h3**

**8...a6 9.Ba4**

**9...b5 10.Bc2**

**10...Re8**

**11.a4 Rb8 12.Nbd2**

Before Black has played ...Bb6 it wouldn't make much sense to play Na3, as the b5-pawn is defended.

**12...Bb6**

is another reasonable way of playing now that Na3 no longer exists.

**13.axb5**

13.Nf1 b4 would be a little bit annoying as we no longer have Nc4.

**13...axb5 14.Nf1**

We intend to play d4 next, setting up a strong centre. There is nothing particularly wrong with Black's position, but we are also getting what we want.

### (641) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...h6 #6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 h6**

**8.h3**

**8...a6 9.Ba4**

**9...b5 10.Bc2**

**10...Re8**

**11.a4 Rb8 12.Nbd2**

**12...b4**

A smart move order by Black. By waiting for Nbd2 they avoided our d4-push.

**13.a5**

These kind of positions are more often reached in 6.d3 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 O-O 9.a4 b4. Black's bishop is a bit more active on c5 than e7, but we can still play in a similar fashion. Next up is Nc4 and Bd2, perhaps followed by Ba4 at some point. Another idea that could come into play at some point is Nh4 followed by Qf3 and Nf5. For instance<skip/>

**13...Bd7 14.Nc4 Ba7**

Prophylactic against d4.

**15.Bd2**

Just developing. 15.Be3 is also natural but trades off a few too many pieces.

**15...bxc3 16.bxc3 Ne7**

Would be a typical move, but it does allow

**17.d4**

With both d4 and e4 solidly protected we are enjoying a nice spatial edge.

### (642) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...h6 #7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 h6**

**8.h3**

**8...a6 9.Ba4**

**9...b5 10.Bc2**

**10...Re8**

**11.a4 Rb8 12.Nbd2**

**12...b4**

**13.a5**

**13...Bd7 14.Nc4 Ba7**

**15.Bd2**

**15...bxc3 16.bxc3 Rb5**

Black is putting some pressure on a5.

**17.Ba4 Rb7 18.Nh4**

Keeps a little pressure. The fundamental problem for Black is that ...d5 never really works, which makes it very hard to find a good plan.

### (643) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

Always a critical response in such positions when playing Re1 before h3. Black attacks f2, but more importantly opens up for the f-pawn.

**8.Re2 f5**

The logical follow-up to the previous move. Now the play gets quite sharp.

**9.exf5 Qf6**

Black is trying to stop d4 for the time being.

**10.Bxc6**

Giving up the bishop in order to force d4 through. 10.h3 Nxf2 11.Rxf2 Bxf2+ 12.Kxf2 is a bit similar to our line in the Open Spanish, but here it seems to be that Black's counterplay is a little bit more dangerous.

**10...bxc6 11.d4 exd4 12.cxd4 Bb6 13.h3**

Kicking the knight back.

**13...Nh6**

We have removed the intruders and there is no longer any question of us coming under an attack anymore. However, we had to give up the bishop pair to achieve it, meaning that Black is now doing fairly well strategically. Therefore we should act quickly.

**14.Qb3+ Kh8 15.Bg5**

Forcing Black to move the queen away from the defense of the h6-knight.

**15...Qxf5 16.Bxh6 gxh6 17.Nbd2**

Black's king is very hard to to get at on h8, but we still have some initiative. Rae1, enter on e7 and then the maneuver Ne4-g3 will put Black under pressure. With the bishop pair in return, it is certainly double-edged, but it seems our play is somewhat more dangerous. For instance

**17...Rg8 18.Re7**

Entering with the rook, intending to double on the 7th rank if allowed. 18.Rae1 or even the slower 18.Nf1 intending Ng3 are perfectly playable alternatives if the mainline looks too sharp.

**18...Qf6 19.Rae1 Bxh3**

Looks scary, but our attack is as strong as Black's.

**20.Rf7**

Ice cold!

**20...Rxg2+ 21.Kh1 Qg6**

The only reasonable square.

**22.Nh4 Qh5 23.Ree7 Bf5**

The only move to cover h7.

**24.Kxg2 Qxh4 25.Qg3 Rg8**

Forcing us to abandon the 7th rank with one rook.

**26.Rg7 Qxg3+ 27.Rxg3**

The forced play is over and we have emerged with an extra exchange. Black certainly has drawing chances, but we are definitely pushing for the win!

### (644) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

**8.Re2 f5**

**9.exf5 Bxf5**

is of course the most natural move, but makes it easier for us to push in the centre.

**10.d4 e4 11.Bg5**

Developing the bishop with tempo.

**11...Qd7 12.Nfd2 Bb6 13.h3**

Kicking the knight away, so that we can pick up the e4-pawn.

**13...Nf6 14.Bxf6 Rxf6 15.Nxe4**

Black does not have enough compensation for the pawn, especially as the bishop on b6 is biting into granite.

### (645) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

**8.Re2 f5**

**9.exf5 Bxf5**

**10.d4 Bb6 11.Bg5 Qe8 12.h3 Qh5 13.Nbd2**

Overprotecting f3. Now we are ready to take the knight next.

**13...h6 14.hxg4 Bxg4 15.Be3**

is a solid extra piece.

**15...e4**

This can't be taken due to Rxf3, but

**16.Nh2**

is very safe.

**16...Bxe2 17.Bxe2**

is not so bad for Black materially, but our pieces easily outweigh Black's rook.

### (646) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

**8.Re2 f5**

**9.exf5 Bxf5**

**10.d4 Bb6 11.Bg5 Qe8 12.h3 Qh5 13.Nbd2**

**13...Nf6 14.Bxf6 Rxf6 15.Ne4 Bxe4 16.Rxe4**

This is a typical good scenario for us. We have not won any material, but the b6-bishop is out of play and long term it is actually the black king that is more vulnerable.

### (647) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

**8.Re2 f5**

**9.exf5 Bxf5**

**10.d4 Bb6 11.Bg5 Qe8 12.h3 Qg6**

A c@nning try. Black is setting up a pin on the g-file (!).

**13.hxg4**

13.Nbd2 h6! now works for Black, as 14.hxg4 Bxg4 15.Be3 is met by 15...Bxf3 , and our g-pawn is pinned.

**13...Bxg4 14.Qd3**

This is the downside of having the queen on g6 - we can step out of the pin by tempo, as a queen trade would be winning for us.

**14...Bf5**

The only move to keep the pressure going.

**15.Qc4+ Kh8**

We can't hold onto the extra piece, but can give it back in return for a positional edge.

**16.Nbd2**

Black was actually threatening Bxb1 - something that is very easy to miss!

**16...e4 17.Bxc6 bxc6 18.Qxc6 exf3 19.Nxf3**

We have an extra pawn, but even that we are willing to give back in order to reach stability.

**19...Bg4 20.Bf4**

A smart move. The bishop will be an excellent defender on g3.

**20...Qf7**

Winning back the pawn.

**21.Bg3**

An excellent square for the bishop, covering our weakest pawn on f2.

**21...Bxf3 22.gxf3 Qxf3 23.Re4**

This is a long line, but it is due to this last move that I really wanted to add it. Black has been attacking us for the last 10-15 moves, and finally we get a chance to trade queens. But we don't! The reason is that once we have reached stability on the kingside we are simply having the more active position. The b6-bishop is still out of the game, we have control over the only open file and can switch to creating threats on the kingside. Furthermore, the queen on c6 is excellently placed on a light square.

### (648) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

**8.Re2 f5**

**9.exf5 Bxf5**

**10.d4 Bb6 11.Bg5 Qc8**

A strange square, but the idea is to avoid the pins.

**12.Nbd2**

A natural developing move, but it does give up control of the d4-pawn.

**12...exd4 13.Bxc6 d3 14.Bd5+**

is a very important intermediate check.

**14...Kh8 15.Re3**

Allowing Black to capture our rook, but the two pieces will easily outmatch the rook in the arising position.

### (649) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

**8.Re2 f5**

**9.exf5 Bxf5**

**10.d4 Bb6 11.Bg5 Qc8**

**12.Nbd2**

**12...exd4 13.Bxc6 bxc6 14.Qb3+**

Not allowing Black ...Be6-d5 later on.

**14...Kh8 15.cxd4**

Material equality is restored. Black has the bishop pair, but we control the e-file and the bishop on b6 is still pretty bad.

**15...h6**

Comes a bit too late, as

**16.Be7 Re8 17.Rae1**

Leaves us with a very strong bishop on e7.

### (650) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

**8.Re2 f5**

**9.exf5 Bxf5**

**10.d4 Bb6 11.Bg5 Qc8**

**12.Nbd2**

**12...h6**

The best move, forcing our bishop away.

**13.Bh4 exd4 14.cxd4**

Sacrificing a pawn. 14.Bxc6 as in the previous line is also possible, but then Black has got in the useful h6-move for free.

**14...Nxd4**

Black has to take, as there are no other reasonable moves.

**15.Nxd4 Bxd4**

A very interesting position. All our pieces are active and we have possibilities to launch an attack using the e7-square, but it is quite hard to prove anything concrete.

**16.h3**

Going for activity. 16.Nf3 Bb6 17.Be7 would win an exchange, but Black seems to get just about enough counterplay with accurate play.

**16...Ne5 17.Nc4**

is very good, as both d4 and e5 are hanging.

### (651) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #9 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

**8.Re2 f5**

**9.exf5 Bxf5**

**10.d4 Bb6 11.Bg5 Qc8**

**12.Nbd2**

**12...h6**

**13.Bh4 exd4 14.cxd4**

**14...Nxd4**

**15.Nxd4 Bxd4**

**16.h3**

**16...Nf6 17.Ne4**

An interesting tactical move, trading off some defenders. 17.Nf3 Bb6 18.Bxf6 Rxf6 19.Re8+ would win the queen, but Black is too likely to be able to set up a fortress.

**17...Bxe4 18.Qxd4 Bg6 19.Bc4+ Kh8 20.Re7**

Gives us huge compensation for the pawn.

### (652) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #10 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

**8.Re2 f5**

**9.exf5 Bxf5**

**10.d4 Bb6 11.Bg5 Qc8**

**12.Nbd2**

**12...h6**

**13.Bh4 exd4 14.cxd4**

**14...Nxd4**

**15.Nxd4 Bxd4**

**16.h3**

**16...Nf6 17.Ne4**

**17...Bxe4 18.Qxd4 d5**

The only move. Black is willing to give back the extra pawn in order to force trades.

**19.f3 Bg6 20.Re7**

Winning back the pawn with 20.Bxf6 Rxf6 21.Qxd5+ is certainly also possible. We would have slightly the safer king and more active position, but the Black position is very solid and the game would likely be close to equal. Instead we are trying to play for long term compensation with the e-file and the bishop pair. With good defense Black should probably be OK, but it looks much easier for White to play.

### (653) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 Ne7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

This is one of the best moves for Black. Voluntarily retreating the bishop looks odd, but we have frequently seen the d4-push being very strong due to attacking the c5-bishop.

**8.a4**

A v@ry direct reaction to 7...Bb6, actually threatening to trap the bishop! Normally, 8.Nbd2 is a good reaction against ...Bb6, but here it runs into 8...Ng4! and Black has an improved version of the 7...Ng4 lines, as there we didn't want to commit our knight to d2 so early. The alternative move 8.h3 stopping any Ng4, gives Black time for 8...Ne7 and after 9.d4 d5! we are back to the position we are trying to avoid by playing 7.Re1 instead of 7.h3.

**8...Ne7 9.d4**

�@� Transposes to 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4

### (654) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 Ng4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...Ng4 9.d4**

works well for us now. The key point is

**9...exd4 10.h3 Nge5 11.Bxc6**

Very important. Normally this would be completely fine for Black after bxc6, but here we are still threatening a5!

**11...Nxc6**

11...bxc6 12.a5 just wins the bishop.

**12.cxd4**

Is just great for us. Black has lost too much time and our centre is solid.

### (655) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a5 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a5**

This is interesting, but as so often the inclusion of a4 a5 favours us. I have said it before, but the two main reasons are: the bishop is more vulnerable on b6 after a Nbd2-c4 and our rook can enter the game via a3.

**9.h3 Ne7**

Black plays as if a4 a5 isn't included.

**10.d4 d5 11.exd5**

Normally not the way we want to capture, but here it makes a lot of sense.

**11...e4 12.Ng5**

Will just pick up the e4-pawn for free.

### (656) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a5 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a5**

**9.h3 Ne7**

**10.d4 d5 11.exd5**

**11...exd4 12.Bg5**

Forcing Black to choose with what to recapture on d5.

**12...Nexd5 13.cxd4 h6 14.Bh4**

Is @ typical sort of position where the isolated pawn is pretty strong. We have a nice outpost for our knight on e5, and the h4-d8 pin is quite annoying for Black (the bishop is far away on b6). Next, we can play Nc3, Bc4 and Qb3, while waiting for a good moment to jump Ne5.

**14...Qd6 15.Nbd2**

Shows one reason why a4 a5 is beneficial for us.

### (657) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a5 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a5**

**9.h3 Ne7**

**10.d4 d5 11.exd5**

**11...exd4 12.Bg5**

**12...Nfxd5**

Generally the most solid move, as the pin against the e7-knight is easier to handle.

**13.cxd4**

13.Bc4!? sacrificing a pawn for the initiative is also a tempting alternative.

**13...h6 14.Bh4 Qd6 15.Nbd2**

This is again good for us.

### (658) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a5 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a5**

**9.h3 Ne7**

**10.d4 d5 11.exd5**

**11...exd4 12.Bg5**

**12...Nfxd5**

**13.cxd4**

**13...h6 14.Bh4 Be6 15.Nc3 Qd6**

Stepping out of the pin. 15...Qc8 does not step into the Ne4-threat, but loses control over vital central squares. 16.Bxe7! Acting immediately, before Black has time for ...c6.16...Nxe7 17.d5 is the point. Due to the problems on the e-file, Black has to go for the tactical operation 17...Nxd5 18.Nxd5 Bxd5 19.Qxd5 c6 , but after 20.Bxc6 Black will have no compensation for the weak c-pawn, with or without queens on the board.

**16.Ne4 Qb4 17.Ra3**

Shows another way a4 a5 helps us. The threat of Rb3 trapping the queen is surprisingly difficult to deal with!

### (659) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a5 #5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a5**

**9.h3 Ne7**

**10.d4 d5 11.exd5**

**11...exd4 12.Bg5**

**12...Nfxd5**

**13.cxd4**

**13...h6 14.Bh4 c6**

The most solid move. Black reinforces the d5-point.

**15.Bc4 Qd6 16.Bxe7**

Giving up the bishop in order to assert dominance on the light squares. 16.Bg3 keeping all pieces on the board is a decent alternative.

**16...Nxe7 17.Nbd2 Nd5 18.Ne4 Qd8 19.Ne5**

gives us a rather dangerous attack!

### (660) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a5 #6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a5**

**9.h3 Ne7**

**10.d4 d5 11.exd5**

**11...exd4 12.Bg5**

**12...Nfxd5**

**13.cxd4**

**13...h6 14.Bh4 c6**

**15.Bc4 Qd6 16.Bxe7**

**16...Nxe7 17.Nbd2 Bf5**

The most solid move. Black is ready to give up the bishop pair to ease the pressure.

**18.Qb3 Nd5 19.Ne4 Bxe4 20.Rxe4**

We have a slight initiative. The opposite coloured bishops favour us, as the d4-pawn securely blocks the dark-squared one, whereas our bishop can attack both d5 and f7. Additionally, we control the only open file. Black is of course solid, but it does look like a pleasant little something for us.

### (661) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a6 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a6 9.Bxc6**

Now we take, but having included a4 and a6 makes it possible for us to play against the b6-bishop.

**9...bxc6 10.a5**

Our idea is that Black's bishop is out of play on a7. For the time being it sounds strange as the diagonal a7-g1 looks useful, but the thing is that in order to prevent us from going d4 long term Black will have to ...c5 at some point. And once c5 is played, the bishop is really struggling on a7.

**10...Ba7 11.h3**

Just calmly completing development, preventing any Ng4 followed by f5 ideas.

**11...Re8 12.Nbd2 Rb8**

12...h6 13.Nf1 Rb8 14.Ng3 transposes to the same line.

**13.Nf1 h6 14.Ng3**

Now we are ready for d4 next.

**14...c5 15.Be3**

Excellent timing! By use of tactics we can develop in the most harmonious way.

**15...Rxb2 16.Qc1**

A surprising double attack!

**16...Rb7 17.Bxh6 gxh6 18.Qxh6**

gives us a winning attack!

### (662) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a6 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a6 9.Bxc6**

**9...bxc6 10.a5**

**10...Ba7 11.h3**

**11...Re8 12.Nbd2 Rb8**

**13.Nf1 h6 14.Ng3**

**14...c5 15.Be3**

**15...d5**

Black probably should play something like this, but we don't have to react.

**16.Qc1**

Is a good reply. Black will likely have to push ...d4 at some point, but then the bishop on a7 is really out of play. We will likely prepare either the b4-break, or close the queenside with c4 and switch to the kingside, where we will be able to push f4 after moves like Rf1 and Nh2.

### (663) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a6 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a6 9.Bxc6**

**9...bxc6 10.a5**

**10...Ba7 11.h3**

**11...Re8 12.Nbd2 Rb8**

**13.Nf1 d5**

looks active, but is not well-timed at all.

**14.exd5 Qxd5**

The only move, as e5 needs protection.

**15.Ng3 h6**

stops Bg5, but now comes an idea that is well worth remembering.

**16.Ra4**

Intending Rh4, with a strong kingside attack! The threat of a bishop sacrifice on h6 will be very unpleasant for Black to stop.

### (664) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a6 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a6 9.Bxc6**

**9...bxc6 10.a5**

**10...Ba7 11.h3**

**11...Re8 12.Nbd2 Rb8**

**13.Nf1 c5 14.Ng3 Be6**

Black is not worried about the pin and develops naturally.

**15.Bg5 h6**

The only move.

**16.Bh4 g5 17.Nxg5 hxg5 18.Bxg5**

is winning for us, as Black can't keep f6 defended.

### (665) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a6 #5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a6 9.Bxc6**

**9...bxc6 10.a5**

**10...Ba7 11.h3**

**11...Re8 12.Nbd2 Rb8**

**13.Nf1 c5 14.Ng3 Be6**

**15.Bg5 h6**

**16.Bh4 Kh7 17.Nh5 Rg8**

The only move, as Black needs to be ready on the g-file as soon as we take on f6. The position is now quite sharp and we have many interesting moves. Generally speaking we are trying to make something happen on the kingside while the bishop is stuck on a7.

**18.Bxf6**

18.Nxf6+ is also tempting.

**18...gxf6 19.Kh2**

Preventing Bxh3 and preparing Nh4. As Black, I would be really worried.

**19...Rxb2**

wins a pawn but is too greedy, as the b-pawn doesn't really matter.

**20.Re2**

We have excellent compensation. One of our knights will land on f5, where it can never be kicked away.
