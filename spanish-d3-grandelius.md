### (527) 25. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 4th Move - 4...Ne7 #1

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Ne7**

This looks ridiculous, but does contain some logic. The first point is that 5.Nxe5?? does not work due to 5...c6! followed by Qa5+, picking up the e5-knight. The other, slightly more serious idea is that the knight is more harmoniously placed on g6 than on c6, which makes sense. On the other hand ...Ne7 does give us some extra time to take over the centre.

**5.O-O**

A practical decision. We are not trying to punish Black immediately, but rather just make natural moves, setting up our normal sort of position and being content with a slight edge. 5.Nc3 c6 6.Bc4 intending a quick d4 is a more ambitious way, which leads to an edge for White as well, but requires much more detailed theoretical knowledge which I think we don't need to bother with.

**5...c6 6.Ba4 Ng6 7.d4**

A small move order trick. It is too dangerous for Black to open up the centre at the moment.

**7...Nxe4 8.Qe2 d5 9.c4**

open up the centre before Black can get their king into safety.

**9...Be6 10.cxd5 Bxd5 11.Bc2**

Provoking further weaknesses

**11...f5 12.Nc3 Nxc3 13.bxc3 e4 14.c4**

gives us a huge initiative. Next, up is Ng5, followed by d5 opening up the centre further. Even giving a piece on e4 could be promising later on.

### (528) 25. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 4th Move - 4...Ne7 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Ne7**

**5.O-O**

**5...c6 6.Ba4 Ng6 7.d4**

**7...Nxe4 8.Qe2 d5 9.c4**

**9...Be6 10.cxd5 Bxd5 11.Bc2**

**11...f5 12.Nc3 Nxc3 13.bxc3 Be7**

Just giving back the pawn is a more solid option for Black.

**14.dxe5 O-O 15.Nd4**

A good move. Material equality is restored, and the combination of Ng6 and pawn f5 makes a strange impression. The f5-pawn is under attack, and moving it forward would open the c2-h7 diagonal for our bishop.

### (529) 25. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 4th Move - 4...Ne7 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Ne7**

**5.O-O**

**5...c6 6.Ba4 Ng6 7.d4**

**7...d6 8.Re1 exd4 9.Nxd4**

Intending c4, giving us a nice spatial edge.

### (530) 25. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 4th Move - 4...Ne7 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Ne7**

**5.O-O**

**5...c6 6.Ba4 Ng6 7.d4**

**7...d6 8.Re1 Be7 9.c3**

Simply defending d4, and setting up the typical Ruy Lopez centre. Although Black is solid here, there is also no significant pressure on our centre, meaning we have a small but comfortable edge.

**9...O-O 10.Bc2**

Overprotecting e4, preparing the maneuver Nbd2-f1-g3. Another nice point is that we never need h3, as without the knight on c6 the move ...Bg4 does not really put any pressure on our d4-pawn.

**10...Re8 11.Nbd2**

We are slightly better, and I don't think it's really necessary to know any more concrete theory. A logical continuation is Nf1-g3, but also grabbing space on the queenside with a4-a5 makes sense. Black is certainly solid and it is definitely not a refutation of 4...Ne7, but our edge is anyway bigger here than in the usual d3-Berlins, which I think should be enough for us.

### (531) 25. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 4th Move - 4...a6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 a6 5.Bxc6**

Just wins the e5-pawn, which is one of the main points of 4.d3!

### (532) 25. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 4th Move - 4...Bd6 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bd6**

Another weird-looking move. Black anticipates our capture on c6, after which the bishop would be decently placed on d6. If we don't take, the idea is to play ...O-O, ...Re8, and ...Bf8, after which the d5-break can come in one move.

**5.O-O O-O 6.Re1 Re8 7.Bg5**

This would be very similar to thesubsequent line, but including ...a6 Ba4 is always in Black's favour.

### (533) 25. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 4th Move - 4...Bd6 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bd6**

**5.O-O a6**

Useful to flick in, now that we don't want to take on c6.

**6.Ba4 O-O 7.c3**

7.Re1 intending d4 without c3 is also interesting, but 7.c3 goes well with the rest of our repertoire. Now the position is very likely to transpose to the Anti-Berlinwith 6...Re8.<skip value="6...Re8"/>

**7...h6**

this is a bit too slow.

**8.Nbd2 b5 9.Bc2 Bc5**

does not, in fact, stop d4.9...Be7 10.d4 would give us a fantastic version of the 6.d3 d6 Ruy Lopez, as Black has nothing to show for the tempo loss Bd6-e7.<skip start="6.d3"/>

**10.d4 exd4 11.e5**

followed by Ne4, with an overwhelming advantage.

### (534) 25. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 4th Move - 4...Bd6 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bd6**

**5.O-O a6**

**6.Ba4 O-O 7.c3**

**7...Re8 8.Bg5**

Black should move the d6-bishop, but no matter if it goes to e7 or f8, with or without h6, we will get something very much like the8...Be7 lines.

### (535) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...Be7 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

Black's second most popular move. In a higher sense, the move 4...Bc5 is a try for equalizing concretely, whereas 4...d6 is a move more likely to be chosen by those who want a fight with Black. As such, it should certainly be welcomed by us. The play now resembles our normal Ruy Lopez repertoire and indeed it most often transposes at some point. Here I will instead show some tries for Black to avoid the transposition.

**5.O-O**

5.c3 is a possible move order and likely to transpose to our Ruy Lopez 5.d3 repertoire, for instance after 5...g6 6.O-O Bg7 7.Re1 O-O 8.h3 and Black should play ...a6 at some point, with a direct transposition.<skip start="5.d3"/>

**5...Be7**

A normal and popular move, but does have very little independent value for our repertoire.

**6.c3 O-O 7.Re1 Bd7**

Transposes to the5...Bd7 move order.

### (536) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...Be7 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...Be7**

**6.c3 O-O 7.Re1 a6 8.Ba4**

is a position from our Ruy Lopez 6.d3 d6 repertoire.<skip/>

### (537) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...Bd7 6.Re1 g6 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...Bd7**

This has gone completely out of fashion. Generally speaking, Black is getting a slightly less flexible version of similar positions that we have already investigated, but there are a few specific lines.

**6.Re1 g6**

Is considered dubious and quite rarely played.

**7.c3**

Intending to transpose to our Ruy Lopez 5.d3 repertoire, but in a version where Black is already committed to ...Bd7.7.d4 is the main theoretical move, but can get really sharp so I don't believe there is any need to study it.<skip/>

**7...Bg7 8.h3 O-O**

Black is trying to play without ...a6 whatsoever.

**9.a4**

An interesting additional possibility we have here. The idea is simply to grab as much space as possible on the queenside.

**9...a6 10.Bc4**

Is a square we have almost never seen the bishop on, but here it works well.

**10...h6 11.a5**

Gives the usual kind of play, but our extra space with a5 is very useful for the future. Next up we play d4 and develop our pieces.

### (538) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...Bd7 6.Re1 g6 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...Bd7**

**6.Re1 g6**

**7.c3**

**7...Bg7 8.h3 O-O**

**9.a4**

**9...a6 10.Bc4**

**10...Na5**

Before we have time to play a5 ourselves.

**11.Ba2 c5 12.Bg5**

One of many moves, but very logical. We simply intend to gain control of the d5-square by giving up our bishop on f6 - an idea we have already seen numerous times in the 6.d3 b5 chapters.<skip/>

### (539) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...Bd7 6.Re1 Be7 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...Bd7**

**6.Re1 Be7**

A rare line. Black is making use of not having included ...a6 and Ba4 by trying to trade the light-squared bishops later on. It's solid, but also pretty passive and not very inspiring.

**7.c3 O-O 8.Nbd2**

Sticking to our usual scheme of development.

**8...Re8 9.Nf1**

The most natural move, putting the knight on g3 and intending to push d4. Another interesting idea is 9.Ba4!? to avoid Black's plan in the mainline.

**9...Bf8 10.Bg5**

The typical reaction to ...Bf8 if Black omits ...h6. The pin is pretty annoying for Black.

### (540) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...Bd7 6.Re1 Be7 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...Bd7**

**6.Re1 Be7**

**7.c3 O-O 8.Nbd2**

**8...Re8 9.Nf1**

**9...h6**

By far the most common move. Black prepares ...Bf8 followed by Ne7.

**10.Ng3 Bf8 11.h3**

Please, don't fall for 11.d4? Nxd4!

**11...Ne7**

Black's idea by not playing ...a6 ever. With our bishop on b5 we can't retreat it to c2, meaning we have to agree on the trade. However, Black spent a lot of time making the trade happen, and we are in time to solidify our centre in the meantime.

**12.Bxd7**

I once played 12.Bc4 Naiditsch against Naiditsch myself, but just trading the bishops and taking the centre looks simpler.

**12...Qxd7 13.d4**

With our solid centre we have a comfortable edge. Next up just develop the remaining pieces, centralize the rook and enjoy life.

**13...Ng6 14.Be3**

Allowing Black's next.

**14...exd4 15.Bxd4**

Forced, but we don't mind it. Next, we can follow up with c4 and our bishop is well-placed on the long diagonal. We no longer have our two abreast centre, but we still have a significant space advantage.

### (541) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Bg4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

A slightly strange-looking but in fact quite ambitious move. Black makes use of the fact that our bishop is trapped!

**6.Bxc6+**

Gaining both time and a structural edge in return for the bishop. 6.Ba4 b5 7.Bb3 Na5 would also lose the bishop, but would have got much less in return.

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

We are intending to play d4 and recapture with our knight on d4, for which the e4-pawn needs to be defended.

**7...Bg4**

As so often in the Spanish, playing ...Bg4 while our pawn is still on d3 does not make a lot of sense. The bishop will either have to give up itself on f3 or get out of play on h5.

**8.Nbd2 Be7 9.h3 Bxf3 10.Nxf3**

Without the bishop pair, Black has nothing to compensate for the worse structure.

### (542) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Bg4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Bg4**

**8.Nbd2 Be7 9.h3 Bh5 10.Nf1**

The bishop is simply not well placed on h5. Next, we play Ng3, and after ...Bg6 the maneuver Nh4-f5 makes a lot of sense. Long term we are still intending to play in the centre with c3 and d4.

### (543) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 c5 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...c5**

This stops our immediate plan, but creates a 'hook' on c5.

**8.c3**

This is very important. It might look strange to play d4 and trade off Black's doubled pawns, but as the famous quote goes: the important thing is not what is leaving the board, but what remains. In the remaining structure Black still has a poor structure with 3 pawn islands to our two, meaning our structural edge is in fact not decreasing at all.

**8...Be7 9.d4 cxd4 10.cxd4 exd4 11.Nxd4 Bd7 12.Nc3**

These kind of positions are very pleasant for White. We have a lot of very natural developing moves, whereas Black struggles to find anything useful to do as we have such a firm grip of the centre.

### (544) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 c5 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...c5**

**8.c3**

**8...Bg4**

On the previous move this was poor, but now we are clearly intending to play d4, which would make the bishop serve a purpose by indirectly attacking the centre.

**9.h3 Bh5 10.d4**

Anyway! It turns out that Black's neglecting of kingside development is important.

**10...cxd4 11.cxd4 Bxf3**

would be the point of ...Bg4, but does not work out well at all.

**12.Qxf3 exd4 13.e5**

Gives us a huge initiative and easily winning back the pawn whenever we want, for instance

**13...dxe5 14.Qc6+ Nd7 15.Rxe5+ Be7 16.Rd5**

Black is all tied up and it looks super scary.

### (545) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 c5 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...c5**

**8.c3**

**8...Bg4**

**9.h3 Bh5 10.d4**

**10...Nd7**

Keeping the centre closed.

**11.Be3**

Important, as we want to settle Black with a sad isolated doubled pawn.

**11...cxd4 12.cxd4**

Is similar to 8...Be7. We have a nice space advantage and many easy moves.

### (546) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 c5 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...c5**

**8.c3**

**8...Bg4**

**9.h3 Bh5 10.d4**

**10...Nd7**

**11.Be3**

**11...Be7 12.dxc5 dxc5 13.Nbd2**

Black has kept the centre under control, and has the bishop pair, but the position is of a closed nature and our knights are equally strong. The ugly doubled c-pawns, therefore, give us a pleasant edge.

### (547) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

By far the main move.

**8.d4**

Our@idea is to increase our space advantage. A funny thing is that this position can also be reached via 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O d6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 8.d4 .

**8...Nd7**

Another reasonably popular move, played for instance by Short and Ponomariov. Black is trying to hold onto the e5-pawn, but it does look awfully passive.

**9.Na3**

A slightly unusual route for the knight, but as both the e5 and c6-pawns are possible targets, it makes a lot of sense to bring our knight to c4.

**9...O-O 10.Nc4 f6 11.Na5**

would force ...Nb8, which is just way too passive for Black.

### (548) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

**8.d4**

**8...Nd7**

**9.Na3**

**9...O-O 10.Nc4 Bf6**

is a very clumsy way of protecting e5.

**11.dxe5**

Black will either end up with a very passive f6-bishop, or trade it off and be left with no compensation for the worse structure.

**11...dxe5 12.b3**

is just very, very nice for us.

### (549) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

**8.d4**

**8...Nd7**

**9.Na3**

**9...O-O 10.Nc4 exd4**

Probably the best try, but it does not inspire confidence.

**11.Nxd4 Bb7 12.Na5**

would lose material instantly

### (550) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

**8.d4**

**8...Nd7**

**9.Na3**

**9...O-O 10.Nc4 exd4**

**11.Nxd4 Nb8**

This looks pretty sad for Black, but it was played by the great Paul Keres, so I will show a few more moves.

**12.Na5 c5 13.Nf5**

13.Ndc6 to pick up the e7-bishop also makes sense, but I like the text better. We now have a very comfortable, active, and easy to play position. Next up we can play Qf3 and then develop our queenside. Black is just too passive for the bishop pair to have any effect.

### (551) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

**8.d4**

**8...exd4 9.Nxd4 Bd7**

An interesting strategical position. Black has the bishop pair, but we have a space advantage and the doubled c-pawns are slightly weak. The main thing we should do is try to prevent Black from breaking free in the centre.

**10.c4**

Not the most common move, but I quite like it. By playing c4 before Nc3 we make sure that ...d5 will be impossible for Black to achieve without damaging his position.

**10...d5**

Is still technically possible, but would be breaking the old rule of not opening up in the centre when being behind in development. There is no direct refutation for us, but we have numerous ways of reaching a very pleasant position.

**11.exd5 cxd5 12.cxd5**

The simplest. We open up as quickly as possible.

**12...Nxd5 13.Qh5**

A powerful move, making use of Black not having castled yet.

**13...Nf6 14.Qc5**

This is the problem for Black and shows very clearly why the move 10...d5 was premature. Due to the pin along the e-file Black can't get castled.

**14...Kf8 15.Qc2**

is just terrible for Black, as it will take too long for Black to reroute the king. We can just develop normally and have a huge advantage.

### (552) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

**8.d4**

**8...exd4 9.Nxd4 Bd7**

**10.c4**

**10...d5**

**11.exd5 cxd5 12.cxd5**

**12...Nxd5 13.Qh5**

**13...c6 14.Bg5**

Again utilizing the pin on the e-file, but this time only to gain a positional advantage by trading the bishops.

**14...O-O 15.Bxe7 Nxe7 16.Nc3**

We did not win anything directly, but Black no longer has the bishop pair and the pawn structure is even worse than before. Both c6 and a6 are weak, and we have an excellent square for a knight or queen on c5.

### (553) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

**8.d4**

**8...exd4 9.Nxd4 Bd7**

**10.c4**

**10...O-O 11.Nc3 c5**

is one of Black's main ideas - they give back the bishop pair but the trade makes the space advantage less of a factor.

**12.Nf5 Bxf5 13.exf5**

is usually slightly better for White. We still have some extra space and the more active pieces, and the Black majority looks immobile.

**13...Nd7 14.Bd2**

Next we go Qc2, Rad1 and then look for knight jumps to e4 or d5.

### (554) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

**8.d4**

**8...exd4 9.Nxd4 Bd7**

**10.c4**

**10...O-O 11.Nc3 Re8**

Universally useful, and the most flexible here.

**12.h3**

A small improving move, waiting for Black to choose a plan before we decide where we want our queen and bishop.

**12...Bf8**

Also natural, but now the bishop can never get to f6.

**13.Bf4 c5 14.Nf3**

Is an interesting change of track here, although 14.Nf5 also makes sense.

**14...Bc6 15.Qd3**

Here Black would really want ...Nd7 followed by ...Bf6, but that isn't possible with the bishop already on f8.

### (555) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**5.O-O**

**5...a6**

**6.Bxc6+**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

**8.d4**

**8...exd4 9.Nxd4 Bd7**

**10.c4**

**10...O-O 11.Nc3 Re8**

**12.h3**

**12...c5**

The most direct move.

**13.Nf5 Bxf5**

is similar to 11...c5. Black is just a bit worse without any real counterplay.

**14.exf5 Nd7 15.Bd2 Bf6 16.Rxe8+ Qxe8 17.Qc2**

We have nice control of the position. Long term, even a pawn push on the kingside could be an interesting idea.

### (556) 26. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 d6 - 5...a6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 7.Re1 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 d6**

**6...bxc6 7.Re1**

**7...Be7**

**8.d4**

**8...exd4 9.Nxd4 Bd7**

**10.c4**

**10...O-O 11.Nc3 Re8**

**12.h3**

**12...c5**

**13.Nf5 Bf8**

The critical move. Black is threatening ...Nxe4!

**14.Ng3**

Voluntarily retreating, but the knight is pretty good on g3, making our e4-pawn well protected. In character, the position hasn't changed a lot. We still intend to develop our remaining pieces and keep control of our extra space. An additional resource that can be of relevance is Nd5, as our e4-pawn is secure.

**14...Bc6 15.Bg5**

Provoking some weaknesses.

**15...h6 16.Bd2 g6**

The most natural plan, activating the bishop on the long diagonal.

**17.Qc2 Bg7 18.Rad1**

Bringing the last piece into the game. We have certainly left the opening phase now. Black has the bishop pair, but still lacks clear targets for attack. Our next moves are likely b3 followed by Nd5, with the idea of Bc3 trading the dark-squared bishops. Black is certainly solid, but it does look like a pleasant position for us to play.

### (557) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Nxd5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

The most active and best move. Black takes the liberty of developing the bishop outside the pawn chain - made possible by our move 4.d3.

**5.c3**

In recent top-level practice this has gone a bit out of fashion, but in relation to the rest of our repertoire it makes a lot of sense. The idea is similar to many of our other lines - we intend to push d4 at an appropriate moment. Black has a very important choice to make now: either develop calmly with O-O, d6 and so on, or go for the immediate ...d5-push. Whereas the slower play leads to positions with a lot of fight for both colours, the d5-lines are generally more forcing in nature and Black is really trying to equalize by very concrete means. 5.c3 is necessary immediately, as if we start with 5.O-O Black has the very annoying 5...Nd4 which trades off the bad c6-knight and equalizes comfortably.

**5...d5**

This immediate ...d5 break is the most popular alternative to 5...O-O in practical play. It was for instance played against me by the theory-expert Vidit in a classical game in 2020.

**6.exd5 Nxd5 7.O-O O-O 8.Bxc6 bxc6 9.Nxe5**

is just a pawn up.

### (558) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd8 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...d5**

**6.exd5 Qxd5**

This is always the best recapture for Black. The queen defends the e5-pawn and the knight is well placed on f6.

**7.Bc4**

Necessary, as Black was threatening ...Bxf2+.

**7...Qd8**

I consider this to be a slightly inaccurate move order for Black. If they want their queen on d8, then it's better to play ... d5 on move 6, as will be explained later.

**8.Bg5**

Generally speaking, this is a good move in these structures. After Black has played ...d5 and we took exd5 the c1-bishop is struggling to find a useful square. Therefore we are prepared to trade it on f6. This would leave us with only good pieces left, and again quite nice control of the light squares in the centre.

**8...Bf5 9.Qe2 O-O 10.Nbd2 h6 11.Bxf6 Qxf6 12.O-O**

is quite similar to the mainline. Another highly interesting option is 12.Ne4 Qe7 13.Rg1!? intending to push g4-g5, but it seems a bit unnecessary to me.

### (559) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd8 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...d5**

**6.exd5 Qxd5**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Qd8**

**8.Bg5**

**8...e4**

is very good with O-O included for both sides.

**9.Qe2**

This is the key difference to the position with both sides having castled already.

**9...O-O 10.dxe4**

Does not give Black enough compensation for the pawn. If need be, we can even castle long later on.

### (560) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd8 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...d5**

**6.exd5 Qxd5**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Qd8**

**8.Bg5**

**8...h6**

The most natural reaction, forcing us to give up our bishop immediately.

**9.Bxf6 Qxf6 10.Nbd2**

Why is this interesting for us? There are a few reasons. The pawn on e5 is somewhat vulnerable, and easy for us to put pressure on, especially as the move ...f6 would weaken the light squares terribly. Secondly, the queen is slightly misplaced on f6 and vulnerable to attacks with Ne4. Thirdly, Black has no clear target themselves, as we lack weaknesses. Long term, apart from the pressure on the e5-pawn, we will grab space on the queenside. Another potential maneuver is Bd5 followed by Nc4, but it depends on what Black is doing.

**10...Bf5**

Intending to castle long is a double-edged way of playing, but our attack comes very fast.

**11.Ne4 Bxe4 12.dxe4**

This shows one of the reasons the position , in general, is promising for us. Our pawn on c3 controls some dark squares and dominates the c6-knight, making both our light pieces better than Black's. That gives us a significant strategic edge here.

### (561) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd8 #

**7.Bc4**

**7...Qd8**

**8.Bg5**

**8...h6**

**9.Bxf6 Qxf6 10.Nbd2**

**10...Bf5**

**11.Ne4 Qe7 12.b4**

Starting the attack.

**12...Bb6 13.O-O O-O-O 14.Qb3**

Stepping out of the pin on the d-file, putting pressure on f7. Both 14.Qe2 and 14.Qc2 are reasonable alternatives.

**14...Bg4**

A smart intermediate move, forcing us back.

**15.Ned2 f6 16.Rfe1**

Activating the rook, making sure no ...e4-breaks are ever possible and hinting at the possibility of d4 at an appropriate moment. Next up we are ready for continued queenside aggression with a4. Black's attack looks slower than ours, especially as the bishop on b6 will be vulnerable.

### (562) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd8 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**7...Qd8**

**8.Bg5**

**8...h6**

**9.Bxf6 Qxf6 10.Nbd2**

**10...O-O 11.O-O Bb6 12.Re1 Bg4**

is nothing to be worried about, as Black has no way to make use of the pin.

**13.h3 Bh5 14.Bd5**

is a nice maneuver, intending Qa4 or Nc4.

### (563) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd8 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**8.Bg5**

**8...h6**

**9.Bxf6 Qxf6 10.Nbd2**

**10...O-O 11.O-O Bd6 12.Re1**

Intending b4, a4-a5 etc.

**12...Be6**

Does not solve Black's problems.

**13.a4 Bxc4 14.Nxc4**

We keep a nagging pressure on the queenside.

### (564) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...d5**

**6.exd5 Qxd5**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Qd6**

The best move in this move order.

**8.Nbd2**

8.Bg5 e4! now works well for Black.

**8...Bf5**

This is a very serious attempt at forcing further liquidation, and was the choice of Vidit against me.

**9.b4 Bb6 10.Ng5**

Necessary, but also a good moment for this, as after a later Ne4 and dxe4, we get a tempo on the f5-bishop. 10.Qe2 O-O-O would be a disaster, as we have no good way of defending d3. The problem is that 11.Ne4 is met by 11...Nxe4 12.dxe4 Bxe4! 13.Qxe4 Qd1 mate!

**10...O-O 11.Nde4**

This is the point! It turns out that the bishop on f5 is a bit vulnerable.

**11...Qe7 12.Qf3**

Now giving up the light-squared bishop would be very sad, but the alternative is even worse:

**12...Bg6 13.h4**

intending h5, with a huge attack!

### (565) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...d5**

**6.exd5 Qxd5**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Qd6**

**8.Nbd2**

**8...Bf5**

**9.b4 Bb6 10.Ng5**

**10...O-O 11.Nde4**

**11...Nxe4**

Forcing an ending.

**12.dxe4 Qxd1+ 13.Kxd1**

We have an ending. It might look dry, but is in fact quite sharp. Both Bb6 and Nc6 are poorly placed, which means that Black is in need of concrete counterplay.

**13...Bg6 14.h4 h5**

14...h6 15.h5 Bh7 16.Nxh7 Kxh7 is also trouble for Black given White's bishop pair and very active pieces. The White King in turn would be surprisingly safe on c2.

**15.f3**

Thi@ is just a very pleasant edge for us, as all 3 (!) of Black's light pieces are out of play.

### (566) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Qd6**

**8.Nbd2**

**8...Bf5**

**9.b4 Bb6 10.Ng5**

**10...O-O 11.Nde4**

**11...Nxe4**

**12.dxe4 Qxd1+ 13.Kxd1**

**13...Bg4+**

Without a doubt the best move.

**14.Kc2**

Against Vidit I played 14.f3 , but after 14...Bd7 followed by h6 the knight on g5 turned out to be a bit stupid. Therefore I instead suggest this interesting pawn sac.

**14...Bxf2**

The pawn is poisoned, but a slow move like 14...a6 does not make sense either, as we are in time to consolidate with 15.Rf1 simply defending f2. Now our knight can always retreat to f3 if necessary.

**15.Rf1**

Wins the f7-pawn with devastating effect.

### (567) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**11...Nxe4**

**12.dxe4 Qxd1+ 13.Kxd1**

**13...Bg4+**

**14.Kc2**

**14...h6**

Black can't take thepoisoned f2-pawn, so this is probably the best option.

**15.Nf3 Bxf3 16.gxf3**

This would have been a problematic structure if Black's knight or bishop were on f4, but now we will easily be able to push f4 whenever we want.

### (568) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**11...Nxe4**

**12.dxe4 Qxd1+ 13.Kxd1**

**13...Bg4+**

**14.Kc2**

**14...h6**

**15.Nf3 Bxf2**

Again the only move that makes sense. Black needs a pawn in return for the suffering.

**16.Rf1 Bxf3 17.gxf3 Bh4**

Black intends ...Bg5, but isn't really in time.

**18.Rg1 Kh7 19.Be3**

Black does have an extra pawn and the bishop is no longer awkwardly placed on b6, but we do have a lot of compensation. Our light-squared bishop is very powerful, we have a possible entry square for a rook on d7 and the old idea of a4-a5-a6 is still highly relevant.

### (569) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8

**13...Bg4+**

**14.Kc2**

**14...h6**

**15.Nf3 Bxf2**

**16.Rf1 Bb6 17.a4**

Gaining space and preparing a nice square for the bishop on a3.

**17...a5 18.b5 Nd8 19.Nxe5**

wins back the pawn with a continuous initiative.

### (570) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**14.Kc2**

**14...h6**

**15.Nf3 Bxf2**

**16.Rf1 Bb6 17.a4**

**17...a6 18.Nh4**

Opening up the f-file, and intending to go Nf5 at an appropriate moment. Black's lack of active ideas is really what makes this position so unpleasant. 18.h3 Bd7 19.Ba3 is another promising direction.

**18...Be6 19.Bxe6**

settles Black with a not so impressive doubled pawn.

**19...fxe6 20.Nf3**

The doubled pawn in itself is not the problem, but it means that Black struggles to defend e5, which makes the c6-knight stuck. We have plenty of time, and can for example go for an idea like Bd2, hinting at the b5-break. Even trading the rooks will be scary for Black, as the problem of Bb6 and Nc6 won't go away.

### (571) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8

**14...h6**

**15.Nf3 Bxf2**

**16.Rf1 Bb6 17.a4**

**17...a6 18.Nh4**

**18...Ne7**

Black improves the knight, making use of the fact that we no longer attack e5.

**19.a5**

Gaining even more space.

**19...Ba7 20.Ba3**

The a3-f8 diagonal is very scary for Black, as the rook will have to stay on f8 due to the weakness on f7.

**20...b5 21.axb6 Bxb6**

Gives Black more breathing room, but makes the a6-pawn vulnerable.

**22.Nf5 Bxf5 23.exf5**

gives us plenty of compensation as the pawn on a6 is weak and f6 is hard to stop.

### (572) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8

**19...Ba7 20.Ba3**

**20...Bd7**

Intending to sacrifice an exchange in case we play b5, and otherwise trade bishops with ...Bb5.

**21.Bb3**

Simply avoiding the bishop trade, and preparing b5 without the bishop hanging after axb5. The position is very, very unpleasant for Black to play. A very nice line that shows just how risky it all is for Black is

**21...Bb5**

is a better move, but something like

**22.c4 Bc6 23.Rae1 Rae8 24.Nf3**

leaves us with great compensation as b5 will always be in the air, but also just slower play with h4-h5 is very unpleasant to face. The black pieces are simply way too passive.

### (573) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8

**20...Bd7**

**21.Bb3**

Making the a7-bishop even worse, and preventing a later ...c5.

**24...cxb6 25.Rae1**

We are 3 pawns down, but close to winning! After the bishop moves, we capture on e5 and the e7-knight will fall.

**25...Bd3 26.Rf3 e4 27.Rxd3 exd3 28.Bxe7**

will leave us a piece up in the end, as the f8-rook won't escape.

### (574) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8

**5...d5**

**6.exd5 Qxd5**

**7...Qd6**

**8.Nbd2**

**8...Bb6 9.b4**

And Black must play either ...Bf5 or O-O, both immediately transposing.

**5...d5**

**6.exd5 Qxd5**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Qd6**

**8.Nbd2**

**8...O-O 9.b4**

An important part of our plan. We grab space on the queenside, but also introduce the later idea of Ba3, creating unpleasant threats along the diagonal.

**9...Bb6 10.O-O**

The most common-sense move. The very direct 10.a4 has been tried quite a bit at top level, but the lines stretch deep into the ending and tend to be quite drawish. 10.O-O has also been played a fair bit, but it certainly leaves much more room for playing on our own.

**10...Bf5**

The only reasonable move. Black needs to do something before we are in time for a4-a5.

**11.Qc2 a5**

is a less flexible move order.

**12.b5 Ne7 13.Nh4**

kicks the bishop away from the attack on the d3-pawn.

**13...Bd7 14.a4**

This is quite similar to 11...Rad8, but simply a worse version for Black. Our knight is not so bad on h4 whereas Black's bishop on d7 means that there is no counterplay towards d3. We play similarly to the mainline, with Ba3, Rfe1 and pressure on e5.

### (576) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...d5 6.exd5 Qxd5 7.Bc4 Qd6 8

**8.Nbd2**

**8...O-O 9.b4**

**9...Bb6 10.O-O**

**10...Bf5**

**11.Qc2 Rad8**

Exactly the same as on the previous move - Black needs to force the play before getting rolled over on the queenside.

**12.a4 a6 13.Ba3**

Wins material, as Black isn't in time to save everything on the diagonal. If you strongly believe in Black's drawing chances in the ending, it's also possible to keep a middlegame character with 13.a5 Ba7 14.Ne4 , with a slight edge.

**13...Bxd3**

The best try, sacrificing an exchange.

**14.Bxd3 Qxd3 15.Qxd3 Rxd3 16.b5 Na5 17.Bxf8 Kxf8 18.Rae1**

Gives Black one pawn and some drawing chances for the exchange, but it's a very long way until a potential draw here.

**10...Bf5**

**11.Qc2 Rad8**

**12.a4 a5**

The only good move for Black.

**13.b5 Nb8**

is a worse square for the knight.

**14.Ba3 Bc5 15.Bxc5 Qxc5 16.Rfe1 Nbd7 17.Nh4**

was played in Caruana-Grischuk, 2017. Black has to give up their bishop, leaving us with a pleasant edge.

**10...Bf5**

**11.Qc2 Rad8**

**12.a4 a5**

**13.b5 Ne7**

The best move. Black is putting the knight on g6, from where it will both protect the e5-weakness and can become active on f4 later on. An important tabiya has arisen. We have gained space on the queenside, but Black has managed to block it and for the moment we can't make further progress there. In the centre the pawn on e5 is more of a target than our d3-pawn, but still Black will be able to defend it reasonably comfortably with ...Ng6. Furthermore, we have some pressure on the a2-g8 diagonal, which is actually quite unpleasant for Black.

**14.Qa2**

Increasing the pressure on the a2-g8 diagonal, making sure the rook can't leave f8. At the same time, we are setting a small trap. 14.Qb3 is another move with very similar ideas, but I like to keep the option of Bb3 and Nc4 in some positions.

**14...Bxd3**

Looks very tempting but works out badly.

**15.Ba3 Qd7 16.Bxd3 Qxd3 17.Bxe7**

just wins a piece.

The only move.

**16.Bxd3 Bxa3**

It looks like all is well for Black, as our d3-bishop is hanging, but this is not so.

**17.Bc2 Bc5 18.Nc4**

The point. Now too many of Black's pawns are hanging.

**18...Qe6 19.Nxa5 Qxa2 20.Rxa2**

Due to the double threat, we emerge with an extra pawn in the ending.

Protecting e5 and getting the knight out of the firing line.

**15.Ba3**

Developing with tempo.

**15...Bc5 16.Bxc5 Qxc5 17.d4 Qd6 18.Rfe1 Rde8**

Trying to keep the e5-pawn alive, but it looks quite clumsy for Black.

**19.g3**

One of many possible moves. We take the f4-square under control and create luft for our king. It's not so easy for Black to keep the tension now, and the most likely scenario is that they have to take on d4 in a worse version than the mainline.

**19...e4**

This is trying to avoid exd4, but it looks very shaky.

**20.Ng5**

Now ...Qf4 is never possible, which is a good benefit of 19.g3.

**20...Re7 21.f3**

Utilizing that Black is a bit overextended.

**21...exf3 22.Ndxf3**

Back is suffering greatly from the weak f7-pawn.

17...Qd6 18.Rfe1 exd4 19.cxd4 reaches the same position.

**18.cxd4 Qd6 19.Rfe1**

The position has stabilized. We have an isolated pawn on d4, but it is very hard for Black to ever attack it. As compensation, we have a good square on e5 for a knight, and control over the e-file. It's not so easy for Black to fight back on the e-file, due to the eternal weakness on f7. Another point of annoyance for Black is the backward c7-pawn, which we can begin to put pressure on with Rac1 next. Another interesting idea is play Bb3, in order to have Nc4 later on. Black is likely OK with perfect play, but it's definitely easier for White to play. I once had a similar position against Eljanov and got very close to winning.

### (582) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

This move order should be preferred by Black if they want their queen on d8 rather than d6.

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd6**

This works less well here, but was tried by Karjakin once.

**9.b4 Bb6 10.Ba3**

Is a very nice extra option we have due to Black having castled too early. Without a rook on f8 this would not have made much sense. Of course, 10.Nbd2 transposing to 5...d5 lines is also perfectly possible.

**10...Ne7**

Karjakin's move, stepping out of the b5-threat.

**11.Nbd2 Bf5 12.Qb3**

Is basically a tempo up compared to previous lines, as we didn't have to play a4.

### (583) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd6**

**9.b4 Bb6 10.Ba3**

**10...Ne7**

**11.Nbd2 a5 12.Qa4**

is a nice additional possibility here.

**12...axb4 13.Qxa8 bxa3 14.Qa4**

does not give Black enough compensation for the exchange, as our rooks have plenty of open files to work on.

### (584) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

This looks passive, but is in fact quite smart. Black does not step into the problematic a3-f8 diagonal and keeps the option of retreating the c5-bishop to d6 or e7.

**9.Nbd2**

Set@ling for calm development. The position is now very positional and strategic. Black is certainly solid, but we also have plenty of ideas. One of the main ideas it to put a knight on e4, and if Black takes, then the advantage of the pawn on c3 vs the knight on c6 gives us a slight initative. Another long term plan is to move the knight over to the kingside and initiate some play there, sometimes even with the help of the g-pawn. Furthermore, grabbing space on the queenside is always an idea, although Black has ways to stop it. 9.Bg5 is not the same as after 5...d5, as Black has the very strong pawn sacrifice 9...e4! 10.Bxf6 Qxf6 11.dxe4 Bg4 . Black gets very active bishops and easy play for the pawn, and practically very easy play. 9.b4 is another tempting move, but here it is met by 9...Be7! keeping the d-file open. Next Black plays ...Bf5, Qd7 and puts pressure on the d3-pawn.<level start="5...d5"/>

**9...h6**

This is a normal move in the structure, but here it looks a little bit slow.

**10.b4**

Immediately grabbing space.

**10...Be7**

Works less well here, as we are in time to attack e5 before d3 falls.

**11.Re1 Bf5**

Would have worked if Black didn't waste a move with ...h6.

**12.Nxe5 Nxe5 13.Rxe5 Bxd3**

13...Qd7 , instead, avoids blundering a piece, but leaves us with a healthy extra pawn after 14.Qf3 . Compared to similar positions, here we are not struggling to develop our pieces. For example: 14...Bg6 15.Nb3 , followed by either d4 or Bf4. Black does not have enough compensation for the pawn.

**14.Bxd3 Qxd3 15.Rxe7**

wins a piece.

### (585) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...h6**

**10.b4**

**10...Bd6 11.Re1**

And we follow up with our usual moves, like Qe2, h3, Ne4 etc.

### (586) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...Bf5**

is a popular move, but it commits the bishop to f5 a bit earlier than necessary. If Black later plays ...Re8 and ...Be6, they will have lost a tempo.

**10.Qe2 Bd6 11.Ne4**

is a good antidote, as Black will lose a tempo if they ever take on e4.

**11...h6 12.a4**

Is a typical follow-up, grabbing space.

**12...Re8 13.b4 Be6**

Was actually played in a few games, but makes a strange impression. I included it mainly to show the following idea.

**14.Re1**

Allowing Black to capture on c4! The doubled c-pawns are quite useful here, as the c5-push is unpleasant for Black to face. Next we follow up with moves like a5, h3, and Bd2. Eventually Black will find it difficult to keep the tension, and take on c4. For instance

**14...Qe7 15.a5 a6 16.h3 Rad8 17.Bd2**

and Black is beginning to struggle finding useful waiting moves.

### (587) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...Bf5**

**10.Qe2 Bd6 11.Ne4**

**11...h6 12.a4**

**12...Re8 13.b4 Be6**

**14.Re1**

**14...Bxc4 15.dxc4**

We will follow up with play on both wings. The only danger here is that Black is able to push ...f5, which we must take every precaution to stop.

**15...Nxe4 16.Qxe4 Qd7 17.a5**

Gaining even more space.

**17...a6 18.g4**

Important. It might look risky to weaken our position like this, but with the queen on e4 controlling everything and Black's knight so far away from the kingside it is perfectly safe. Next up we can either play Kh1, Rg1 and try to do something on the g-file, or just Be3, Rad1 and perhaps Rd5, putting pressure in the centre.

### (588) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...a6**

Is another quite solid move. Black is threatening ...b5, so we are forced to commit our pawn to a4.

**10.a4**

10.b4 Be7! would be similar to 9.b4.

**10...h6 11.b4 Ba7**

This looks natural, to keep the bishop on the a7-g1 diagonal, but it also allows us to take control of the a3-f8 diagonal instead.

**12.h3**

Our usual preparatory move.

**12...Bf5 13.Qc2**

Protecting d3, but also keeping the possibility of Qb3 later on. Now we are intending to play Re1 and Ne4, for instance

**13...Re8 14.Re1 Qd7 15.Ne4 Nxe4 16.dxe4 Be6 17.Rd1 Qe7 18.Qb3**

With some pressure. The bishop on a7 looks active, but in reality it is not doing a lot as f2 will never be possible to attack twice. Rather, our bishop coming to a3 next is the more powerful one. After the trade of light-squared bishops, the d5-square will be excellent for our rook.

### (589) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...a6**

**10.a4**

**10...h6 11.b4 Bd6 12.Re1 Re8**

The most natural move after ...h6 is played. Black intends ...Be6 without having lost a move on ...Bf5 earlier on.

**13.Ne4**

Allowing Black the symmetrical structure, but that does not mean that the position is equal.

**13...Nxe4 14.dxe4 a5**

Is an interesting positional concept for Black - they lose some time, but gain a nice square on c5.

**15.b5 Nb8 16.Qb3**

Developing with tempo.

**16...Be6 17.Be3 Nd7 18.Red1**

Intending to double on the d-file, and perhaps later bring the knight via d2 to c4. Black is certainly solid, but we do have the more active position and some potential targets on the queenside.

### (590) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...a6**

**10.a4**

**10...h6 11.b4 Bd6 12.Re1 Re8**

**13.Ne4**

**13...Be6 14.Qe2**

Similar to the line with 9...Bf5, but here Black has an extra tempo due to not having played ... Bf5 first. Still, the position is not supersensitive to tempi, and the play will be similar to what we saw there. For instance

**14...Bxc4 15.dxc4 Nxe4 16.Qxe4 Qd7 17.g4**

Is the same idea, never to allow ... f5. We follow up with Be3 and then either Rad1-d5 or Kh1, Rg1.

### (591) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...a5**

This is the most popular move in correspondence chess, and the recommendation of Jarmula in his Chessable course. Black prevents b4, limiting us to play exclusively on the kingside and in the centre. On the other hand the move ... a5 weakens the b5-square and stops Black from ever pushing ...b5 themselves.

**10.h3**

A small little move, taking the g4-square under control and waiting to see how Black reacts next. We should not commit our pawn to a4 yet, as it would lose a lot of flexibility.

**10...a4**

Grabs further space, but not really contributing to the fight for the centre.

**11.Re1 Qd6 12.Qe2 Bf5 13.Ng5**

Is again an interesting reply, intending Nde4.

**13...h6 14.Nde4 Qe7 15.Qf3**

is similar. Black will have to give up the light-squared bishop, giving us good long-term prospects with the bishop pair.

### (592) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...a5**

**10.h3**

**10...a4**

**11.Re1 Qd6 12.Qe2 Bf5 13.Ng5**

**13...h6 14.Nde4 Bxe4 15.Nxe4 Nxe4 16.dxe4**

This is a sort of position we are happy to get in this line. It is not much, but it is definitely something. Black is solid, but the bishop pair will be an asset for a very, very, long time.

### (593) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...a5**

**10.h3**

**10...Bf5 11.Qe2 Bd6 12.Ne4**

Is again fairly pleasant for us.

**12...h6 13.g4**

is a very interesting way of fighting for the initiative. We have a lot of pieces on the kingside so there is very little risk of getting punished, while we have some play of our own with Kh1, Rg1 and then either a g5-push or the maneuver Nh4-f5.

### (594) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...a5**

**10.h3**

**10...h6**

A typical useful move, preventing Ng5 which makes ... Re8 a possible move later on.

**11.Re1 Re8 12.Bb5**

is a little unpleasant, as e5 is weak.

### (595) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**5...O-O 6.O-O d5**

**7.exd5 Qxd5 8.Bc4 Qd8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...a5**

**10.h3**

**10...h6**

**11.Re1 Qd6**

Simply protecting e5.

**12.Qe2 Re8**

is very risky before Black have connected their rooks.

**13.d4 exd4 14.Qxe8+ Nxe8 15.Rxe8+ Kh7 16.Ne4**

gives us a very promising initiative for the queen

**16...Qd7 17.Bd3**

is the point.

**17...f5**

The only move to keep the queen alive

**18.Rxc8 Qxc8 19.Nxc5**

We have 3 good pieces for the queen and pawn, something that almost always favours the pieces. I see no reason for this position to be an exception and would thoroughly enjoy playing White.

### (596) 27. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 - 5...O-O 6.O-O d5 7.exd5 Qxd5 8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5**

**5.c3**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...a5**

**10.h3**

**10...h6**

**11.Re1 Qd6**

**12.Qe2 Bf5**

12...Be6 13.Nxe5 just picks up a pawn.

**13.Nf1**

Intending Ng3 - a logical reaction against ...Bf5.

**13...Rfe8 14.Ng3 Bh7**

14...Be6 15.Bb5!? is still a bit unpleasant for Black. 14...Bg6 15.Nh4 intending Ngf5 and Qf3 creates some tension around the Black's kingside.

**15.Nd2**

Intending Nde4 and dxe4, after which the h7-bishop looks offside. Later on, we will be able to build slowly on the kingside.

### (597) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...Be7 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

Delaying ... d6 must always be treated carefully in the Ruy Lopez. Black gains two main things from it: one is that the move ...d5 can later be played in one go, the other that the c5-bishop can still retreat to e7 or f8, if necessary.

**7.Bg5**

Intended to stop ...d5. Usually, we are a bit hesitant to place our bishop on g5 this early, but it makes some additional sense after ...Re8. If Black pushes 8...h6 9.Bh4 g5 , then the rook would be better placed on f8 to support a later ...f5-break. Thinking even further ahead, if after 10.Bg3 Black goes Nh5-Nxg3 hunting down our bishop, then after fxg3 the f7-pawn is weaker! This sounds a bit far-fetched, but it is surprisingly relevant for the evaluation of the move ...Re8.7.Re1 would not be as good here, due to 7...a6 8.Ba4 d5! gaining counterplay in the centre.<skip/>

**7...a6**

As usual a good move to flick in when we are not taking on c6.

**8.Ba4**

Now Black has two main ways of playing: either pushing h6 and g5, which is the sharpest, or play ...Be7, which is the solid option.

**8...Be7**

Black opts for the solid option. It does lose a tempo, but in the closed structure that arises that is not such a big problem. The potential trade of dark-squared bishops is beneficial for Black as they lack space.

**9.Nbd2**

Continuing with our development. We don't want to commit our rook to e1 yet, as the f-file might open later.

**9...d6 10.h3 Nh5 11.Be3**

leaves the knight doing nothing on h5.

### (598) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...Be7 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**7.Bg5**

**7...a6**

**8.Ba4**

**8...Be7**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...d6 10.h3 h6**

The typical reaction from Black, and the continuation of the strategy started with 8...Be7.

**11.Bh4 Nh5 12.Bg3**

This is what it's all about! Trading on e7 would have led to a very dry position, in which Black is supersolid. By playing Bg3 we are ready to give up the bishop pair, but as so often in the Ruy Lopez, it is not necessarily a good thing for Black to take. The f7-pawn is a bit weak and the light squares are soft. Meanwhile, the position is blocked, making our knights at least as useful as Black's bishops.

**12...Bg5**

In fact, this is the most typical reaction from Black. As our bishop is relatively passive on g3 Black sees no great need to take it just yet.

**13.Re1**

Giving Black a second chance to capture on g3.13.Nxg5 Qxg5 14.Nf3 is also very reasonable, but as we have traded off a supporter for the d4-break we are increasing the risk of our dark-squared bishop becoming out of play.

**13...Qf6 14.Nxg5**

Now we have won a free tempo.

**14...Qxg5 15.Kh2**

Protecting g3. Now we are intending Nf3 followed by d4.

### (599) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...Be7 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...d6 10.h3 h6**

**11.Bh4 Nh5 12.Bg3**

**12...Bg5**

**13.Re1**

**13...Nxg3 14.fxg3**

The play is similar to the immediate 12...Nxg3 13.fxg3. Our rook would be a bit better placed on the open f-file, but on the other hand, the g5-bishop is slightly vulnerable. An additional possibility that makes sense here is the maneuver Nf1-e3-d5, as the f1-square is free. Yes, Black has the bishop pair, but the light squares, the f-file and especially the fact that Black struggles to find an active plan of their own means that we should be happy.

### (600) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...Be7 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**7.Bg5**

**7...a6**

**8.Ba4**

**9.Nbd2**

**9...d6 10.h3 h6**

**11.Bh4 Nh5 12.Bg3**

**12...Nxg3 13.fxg3**

is strategically interesting. We are intending to play Bb3, putting pressure on f7. Playing Qe2 and doubling the rooks on the f-file also makes sense. At an appropriate moment even d4 can be considered, especially if there is a Black bishop on e6.

**13...Bf6**

does not block the f-file forever, as we have both Nh2-g4 and Nc4-e3-d5 as later options.

**14.Qe2**

followed by Rf2 and Raf1 is promising for us.

### (601) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...Be7 #5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**9...d6 10.h3 h6**

**11.Bh4 Nh5 12.Bg3**

**12...Nxg3 13.fxg3**

**13...Be6 14.d4**

A concrete reaction against ...Be6. Slower play with 14.Qe2 or 14.Kh1 is also possible.

**14...exd4 15.cxd4 d5 16.e5**

would be very good for us - Black's c6-knight prevents counterplay with ...c5, and we can just build up on the kingside.

### (602) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...Be7 #6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**7.Bg5**

**12...Nxg3 13.fxg3**

**13...Be6 14.d4**

**14...exd4 15.cxd4 b5 16.Bc2 Bd7**

Forced.

**17.Kh2**

A good prophylactic move, making sure d4 is not hanging with check.

**17...Bf6 18.Bb3**

Is the point. With the king on g1 Black would now have been able to capture on d4.

**18...Rf8**

Necessary, to protect f7.

**19.Nb1**

An interesting maneuver, intending Nc3-d5. We have the d4-pawn safely protected and with the knight coming to d5, potential for initiative. Black does still have the bishop pair and a solid position, but to my eyes, the position looks a lot easier for White to play.

### (603) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**7.Bg5**

**7...a6**

**8.Ba4**

**8...h6**

The most normal reaction after Bg5. Black forces us to choose the direction of the bishop.

**9.Bh4**

The most reasonable continuation, but it should be noted that from now on Black always has the option of ...g5, when our bishop might get out of play on g3. Still, ...g5 is also a pretty serious weakening move, so it is generally not something we should fear.

**9...Be7 10.Nbd2 d6 11.h3**

Transposes to 8...Be7 9.Nbd2 d6 10.h3 h6 11.Bh4.

### (604) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 b5 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**7.Bg5**

**7...a6**

**8.Ba4**

**8...h6**

**9.Bh4**

**9...b5**

This is an important position, as we are breaking our rule here!

**10.Bb3**

Having played c3, we normally retreat the bishop all the way to c2, but here we need to think back to move 6, where Black by 6...Re8 kept the possibility of playing ...d5 in one move. Therefore, we now need to fight against the d5-idea, meaning that our bishop is better placed on b3.10.Bc2 g5 11.Bg3 d5 is OK for Black.<level start="6...Re8"/>

**10...g5 11.Bg3 d5**

With the bishop on b3, we are much better placed for this now.

**12.exd5 Nxd5**

With the bishop on c2 Black would have preferred to take with the queen on d4, but here it obviously isn't possible.

**13.Nbd2**

Black is overextended. A well-timed d4-break will likely make Black's position collapse soon.

### (605) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 b5 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**7.Bg5**

**7...a6**

**8.Ba4**

**8...h6**

**9.Bh4**

**9...b5**

**10.Bb3**

**10...Be7 11.a4**

An idea well known to us from the 6.d3 b5 Spanish, and a good moment for it here as well.<skip/>

**11...b4 12.a5**

With very similar play to what we have seen before. The bishop on h4 makes a slight difference, but if anything it's slightly better there than on c1. Next we play Nbd2-c4, and can then slowly begin to prepare d4 with moves like Re1 and h3.

### (606) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 g5 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**7.Bg5**

**7...a6**

**8.Ba4**

**8...h6**

**9.Bh4**

**9...g5**

As usual in lines with Bg5, this is the most critical reaction. Without Black having played ...d6 we can never even think about sacrificing on g5, as Black will have ...Be7 afterwards.

**10.Bg3 d6**

The@position is double-edged, and quite similar to the Ruy Lopez lines with 5.d3 b5 6.Bb3 Bc5 7.Bg5. There are some differences though. First, we have already castled. Secondly, Black has spent a move on ...Re8, which is not at all clearly a better square than f8 (remember, one of Black's main plans is to push ...f5). The 3rd and perhaps most important difference though, is that Black hasn't yet committed to ...b5, which means that we don't have our usual target to attack with a4, etc. Instead, our play is now almost exclusively aimed at the centre and the kingside. A well-timed d4-push, but also the maneuver Nbd2-f1-e3, perhaps followed up by h4!?.<skip/>

**11.Re1 Ba7**

We have seen this numerous times before. Black steps out of the d4-threat.

**12.Nbd2 Ne7**

would be the most typical maneuver, but isn't possible here.

**13.Bxe8**

Another disadvantage of the 'extra' move ...Re8.

### (607) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 g5 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**7.Bg5**

**7...a6**

**8.Ba4**

**8...h6**

**9.Bh4**

**9...g5**

**10.Bg3 d6**

**11.Re1 Ba7**

**12.Nbd2 Nh7**

The most active move. Black is looking for counterplay with ...h5-h4. Now play gets very sharp, as we need to act forcefully so as not to get rolled over by Black's pawns.

**13.Nf1**

Bringing the knight towards e3.

**13...h5 14.h4**

This is very important. By playing h4 we force Black to block the kingside, after which we can again focus on the centre. The downside is that our f3-knight is kicked back and that the h4-pawn is weak, but we are ready to sacrifice the pawn in order to get play in the centre.

**14...Bg4 15.N1h2**

Shows why the knight maneuver is so important.

### (608) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 g5 #3

**11.Re1 Ba7**

**12.Nbd2 Nh7**

**13.Nf1**

**13...h5 14.h4**

**14...g4 15.N3h2**

The knight is bad on h2, but we do have a straightforward plan of getting play in the centre.

**15...Qf6**

Just developing like this is possible, but a bit slow.

**16.Ne3 Be6 17.Qd2**

Continuing with our plan. Next, we go Rad1 after which d4 will come soon. An additional possibility against the queen on f6 could be to play for the f3-break, but for now there is no need as d4 is good enough.

### (609) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 g5 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**12.Nbd2 Nh7**

**13.Nf1**

**13...h5 14.h4**

**14...g4 15.N3h2**

**15...Nf8**

The best move! Black immediately goes for our h4-pawn.

**16.Qd2 Ng6**

would be a huge mistake

**17.Qh6**

suddenly Black can't defend h5

### (610) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 g5 #5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**14...g4 15.N3h2**

**15...Nf8**

**16.Qd2 Kg7**

Absolutely necessary.

**17.Rad1 Ng6**

As I warned you before, we can't defend our h4-pawn.

**18.d4**

Both sides have achieved their aim. Black can pick up the h4-pawn in numerous ways, but we are content with the counterplay we have obtained in the centre. Black needs to do something about the e5-pawn, after which one of many interesting options for us is Ne3-f5, perhaps followed by f3. It is very difficult to predict what exactly will happen from here on, but I will show a few lines to illustrate how the game might develop.

**18...Bd7 19.Bxc6**

Giving up the bishop to relieve the pressure on the d4-pawn.

**19...bxc6 20.Kh1**

Intending to push f3, opening up the f- or even the g-file. Black can still pick up a pawn on h4, but the extra pawn is not felt at all once we begin our attack. It is still quite a messy position, but I believe it's much easier for White to play.

### (611) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 g5 #6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**16.Qd2 Kg7**

**17.Rad1 Ng6**

**18.d4**

**18...exd4 19.Bxc6 bxc6 20.cxd4 Nxh4**

A straightforward and logical way for Black to play.

**21.Bf4**

An important move, freeing up the g3-square for the knight and activating the bishop.

**21...Ng6 22.Bh6+ Kh7 23.Qc1**

This is the last critical move for us. We have to stop ...Bxd4, which can now safely be captured by the rook. Next up we can play Ng3-h5, after which Black's king will be very weak.

**23...h4**

It is important that Black should not really try to stop our knight with this move as we have a strong follow-up.

**24.Ne3**

Black covered g3, but the e3-square will do just fine for the knight too!

**24...Rxe4**

24...Kxh6?? 25.Nf5+ and Qh6-Qh7 is mate in two.

**25.Qxc6**

Attacks both rooks! We have frequently seen a similar tactic against knights on c6 and e4, but the double attack against the rooks is of course as effective as against the knights!

### (612) 28. Anti-Berlin 4.d3 Bc5 6.O-O - 8...h6 9.Bh4 g5 #7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O Re8**

**21.Bf4**

**21...Ng6 22.Bh6+ Kh7 23.Qc1**

**23...h4**

**24.Ne3**

**24...g3**

is the only move, but every pawn move on the kingside is more likely to make Black's king weaker rather than giving counterplay, as we have so many pieces around the kingside.

**25.fxg3 hxg3 26.Nf3**

Intending Nf5, with an ongoing attack. The bishop on h6 is still immune due to the same reasons as on move 24.

### (613) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...a6 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

Black's most popular move. The move d6 indicates that Black is ready to just develop their pieces and start to play chess. Now there are a lot of possible moves for both sides, but even so, the position is one more about understanding than about specifics. In order to really fight for an edge, though, we should pay attention to some move orders here.

**7.Re1**

Highly controversial, and pretty rare. The move Re1 in this structure is of course a very logical and normal one, but here specifically it is a little bit rare. In my opinion, it is one of the most ambitious, though. We are protecting e4, making it possible to push d4, but for the time being not committing to h3 or Nbd2, which are the two other natural moves. After 7.h3 I don't particularly like facing the continuation 7...Ne7! intending to push c6 and d5. After 8.d4 Bb6 the game usually continues 9.Bd3 d5 10.Nxe5 Nxe4 , and this position is a bit too dry to my taste.

**7...a6**

This is another popular move after 7.h3, but here we can again make use of the tempo gained by executing another really interesting idea.

**8.Bxc6**

Usually we don't want to give up our proud light-squared bishop, but we have a specific follow-up in mind.

**8...bxc6 9.Bg5**

This is the idea. Normally this pin is not particularly worrisome, but here the move Re1 is very useful, as our main idea is still to push d4. The direct 9.d4 Bb6 10.Bg5 is also interesting.

**9...h6 10.Bh4 Bb6**

We have seen this prophylactic retreat in a few other similar positions. Black steps out of d4 with tempo.

**11.Nbd2 g5**

Sooner or later this is obligatory, as Black can't tolerate the pin forever.

**12.Bg3 c5**

Trying to prevent us from playing d4...

**13.d4**

But we do it anyway. This kind of sacrifice is quite common after Black has played the weakening ...g5 move.

**13...cxd4 14.cxd4 exd4 15.Nc4 Bc5 16.Nxd4**

This wins back the pawn with a continuous initiative.

### (614) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...a6 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...a6**

**8.Bxc6**

**8...bxc6 9.Bg5**

**9...h6 10.Bh4 g5**

The most critical response.

**11.Bg3 g4**

Another typical reaction. Black forces the knight to h4, where it runs the risk of being out of play.

**12.Nh4**

12.d4 is sharper and more double-edged.

**12...Nh5 13.Nd2 Qf6**

Is the typical follow-up. Black is fighting for the squares on the kingside.

**14.Rf1**

Looks interesting for White. We intend Nc4-e3, and if Black takes the e3-knight, then we get play on the f-file. Meanwhile, it is not entirely clear how Black is intending to create counterplay with the kingside blocked.

### (615) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...a6 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...a6**

**8.Bxc6**

**8...bxc6 9.Bg5**

**9...h6 10.Bh4 g5**

**11.Bg3 Bg4**

A normal move. The bishop is trying to cover the weaknesses on the kingside, at the same time creating an unpleasant pin on our f3-knight.

**12.Nbd2 Re8**

A slower much such as this allows us to execute our idea:

**13.h3 Bh5 14.Qa4 Qd7 15.d4**

And now Black has to give up the centre, as both e5 and c5 are attacked.

**15...exd4 16.cxd4**

We are happy having provoked exd4.

### (616) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...a6 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...a6**

**8.Bxc6**

**8...bxc6 9.Bg5**

**9...h6 10.Bh4 g5**

**11.Bg3 Bg4**

**12.Nbd2 Ba7**

Funnily enough, this is often a worse square than b6 for a surprising reason.

**13.h3 Bh5 14.Qa4 c5 15.Qxa6**

With the bishop on b6, the a6-pawn would have been defended!

### (617) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...a6 #5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...a6**

**8.Bxc6**

**8...bxc6 9.Bg5**

**9...h6 10.Bh4 g5**

**11.Bg3 Bg4**

**12.Nbd2 Bb6**

Again important prophylaxis from Black.

**13.Nc4 Re8**

Aimed at our d4, as the e4-pawn comes under pressure.

**14.d4**

The most direct way. Slower moves are also possible and lead to an interesting strategic battle.

**14...exd4 15.Nxb6**

To be able to recapture with the queen on d4.

**15...cxb6 16.Qxd4 c5 17.Qd3 d5 18.e5 Ne4 19.Rad1**

Activates the rook and puts some pressure on the centre. One thing to note is that after

**19...Qd7**

It does not really lead anywhere to take on d5, so we should rather play something like h3 intending h4.

**20.h3 Bf5 21.Qe3**

With some play against Black's king.

### (618) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...a6 #6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...a6**

**8.Bxc6**

**8...bxc6 9.Bg5**

**9...h6 10.Bh4 g5**

**11.Bg3 Bg4**

**12.Nbd2 Bb6**

**13.Nc4 Re8**

**14.d4**

**14...exd4 15.Nxb6**

**15...cxb6 16.Qxd4 Bxf3**

Forces an ugly doubled pawn, but removes a kingside defender.

**17.gxf3 d5 18.exd5 Rxe1+ 19.Rxe1 Nxd5 20.h4**

We are enjoying some initiative against Black's king, especially as the a8-rook is not yet in the game.

### (619) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 a6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

A very logical move, played in the same style as against 7.h3. Black intends to play c6 and d5 as quickly as possible, and the knight will find an excellent square on g6.

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

An interesting way of making use of the tempo gained by omitting h3.

**9...a6**

This is slightly strange, as it does not mix well with the idea of Ne7 and c6.

**10.Bf1 exd4**

would give Black counterplay against our centre without a4 a6 included, but here we have an extra option.

**11.cxd4 Bg4**

This puts pressure on d4, but we can protect it by the very smart a5.

**12.a5 Ba7 13.Ra4**

Now the d4-pawn is safe. Next, we can follow up with natural developing moves like Nc3. Black looks active, but with our centre secured the Black activity will evaporate bit by bit.

### (620) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 a5 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...a5**

This makes some sense, but the inclusion of a4 a5 favours White for two reasons: the bishop is more vulnerable on b6, and our rook can be brought into the game via a3.

**10.Nbd2 Ng6 11.h3 c6 12.Bd3**

Intending Nf1-g3, looks quite pleasant for White.

### (621) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 a5 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...a5**

**10.Nbd2 exd4 11.cxd4 Bg4**

This is often an interesting reaction from Black in these positions, but it works less well with a4 a5 included.

**12.h3 Bh5 13.e5 dxe5 14.dxe5 Nfd5 15.Ne4**

Just gives us a nice initiative for free.

### (622) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 a5 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...a5**

**10.Nbd2 exd4 11.cxd4 Bg4**

**12.h3 Bh5 13.e5 Nfd5 14.exd6 Qxd6 15.Nc4**

This is one of the differences - Black will not be able to recapture on b6 with the a-pawn.

**15...Qd8 16.Nxb6 Nxb6 17.Bd2**

Black is certainly solid, but we do have the two bishops and the a5-pawn will always be a target.

### (623) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

The most logical move, as c6 is anyway part of Black's plan.

**10.Bf1**

In these positions it's always a tough choice where to place the bishop. On d3 it overprotects e4 and is generally a bit more active, but also more vulnerable. It runs into d5 exd5 e4 tactics, and sometimes a knight coming to f4. Here I don't think Black is able to push ...d5 in a good way anyway, so I prefer the bishop on f1.

**10...d5 11.exd5 e4 12.d6**

A typical intermezzo, not allowing Black to support the e4-pawn with cxd5.

**12...Qxd6 13.Ne5**

Our knight on e5 is stable while the pawn on e4 is weak.

### (624) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...exd4**

This is very interesting, and a typical way for Black to play in these positions. The point is that after ...d5 Black will get a very good knight on e4. Still, it's always a strategic risk to give up the centre like this, and I like our chances.

**11.cxd4 d5 12.e5 Ne4 13.Nc3 f5**

Supporting the knight. If it moves we are just better.

**14.exf6**

A simple way to play - the knight has to retreat.

**14...Nxf6 15.a5**

A typical trick we should always keep in mind in these positions - Black can't take it due to the e7-knight hanging: 15...Bxa5?? 16.Rxa5 Qxa5 17.Rxe7 .

**15...Bc7 16.h3**

Preventing ...Bg4. The structure is now very comfortable for us. We have the safer king long-term and a nice outpost on e5. Ne5 is of course a good move, but also Bd3 and Bg5 will increase the pressure.

### (625) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...exd4**

**11.cxd4 Bg4**

Creating some unpleasant pins.

**12.Ra3**

A key resource. The rook will be needed to recapture on f3 without losing the d4-pawn.

**12...Ng6 13.h3 Bxf3 14.Rxf3**

Fancy, but also effective!

**14...d5**

Black has to act quickly, otherwise we are just clearly better with the bishop pair and nice centre.

**15.e5 Ne4 16.g3**

Intending to develop the bishop to g2, at the same time preventing ...Nh4.

**16...c5 17.Nd2 cxd4 18.Nxe4 dxe4 19.Rxe4**

This is very nice for us. The d-pawn is more weak than strong, and we have an excellent square for our bishop on d3.

### (626) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...exd4**

**11.cxd4 Bg4**

**12.Ra3**

**12...Ng6 13.h3 Bxf3 14.Rxf3**

**14...d5**

**15.e5 Ne4 16.g3**

**16...f6 17.exf6 Rxf6 18.Bg2**

Looks quite pleasant for us. The pawn on d4 is isolated, but we have more pawns in front of our king and a potentially strong light-squared bishop. For instance

**18...Qf8 19.Rxf6 Qxf6 20.Bxe4**

This picks up a pawn, which is the point of g3 Bg2!

### (627) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...exd4**

**11.cxd4 Bg4**

**12.Ra3**

**12...Ng6 13.h3 Bxf3 14.Rxf3**

**14...d5**

**15.e5 Ne4 16.g3**

**16...f6 17.exf6 Rxf6 18.Bg2**

**18...Qf8 19.Rxf6 Nxf6 20.Na3**

Intending to put the knight on c2, covering our only weakness on d4. Next, we will slowly activate our bishop pair and enjoy a pleasant ending.

### (628) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...exd4**

**11.cxd4 Bg4**

**12.Ra3**

**12...d5**

Looks tempting to get the knight to e4.

**13.e5 Ne4 14.Nbd2**

Intending to trade the knight.

**14...f5 15.exf6 Nxf6 16.h3 Bh5 17.a5**

Our typical tactical trick, gaining a nice initiative.

**17...Bc7 18.a6 b6 19.g4 Bg6 20.Bg2**

This is just great for us. Next, we play Ne5 followed by f4, with complete dominance of the centre.

### (629) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...exd4**

**11.cxd4 Bg4**

**12.Ra3**

**12...d5**

**13.e5 Ne4 14.Nbd2**

**14...Nxf2**

The most critical move. It looks scary for us, but everything is under control!

**15.Kxf2 Bxd4+ 16.Kg3 Bh5 17.Qc2**

An important move, attacking the d4-bishop, preventing ...Nf5+ and intending Bd3.

**17...Bb6 18.Bd3**

followed by h3 and Kh2, with complete safety.

### (630) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...exd4**

**11.cxd4 Bg4**

**12.Ra3**

**12...Bh5**

Very advanced. Black makes a useful waiting move, intending to get ...d5 followed by ...Ne4 in an improved version.

**13.h3**

In order to break the pin with g4 later. 13.Bg5 d5 14.Bxf6 gxf6 15.Nc3 is a calmer option, which leads to a strategically double-edged position.

**13...d5 14.e5 Ne4**

The inclusion of h3 Bh5 will give Black an additional tempo, as the bishop won't be hanging on g4 later.

**15.Nbd2 Nxf2**

Is again the critical move. 15...f5 16.exf6 Nxf6 17.a5 would transpose to 12...d5.

**16.Kxf2 Bxd4+ 17.Kg3**

The bishop is already on h5, so we don't win a tempo.

**17...Qc7 18.Be2**

Breaking the pin, attacking the d4-bishop.

**18...Bxe5+**

is an error.

**19.Nxe5 Qxe5+**

wins another pawn but lets our king back to complete safety

**20.Kf2**

Here we are just clearly better, as the pawns aren't moving and our pieces will soon become very strong.

### (631) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #9 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...exd4**

**11.cxd4 Bg4**

**12.Ra3**

**12...Bh5**

**13.h3**

**13...d5 14.e5 Ne4**

**15.Nbd2 Nxf2**

**16.Kxf2 Bxd4+ 17.Kg3**

**17...Qc7 18.Be2**

**18...Bc5 19.Rc3**

The position is still very sharp, but I do fancy our extra piece. After 19...Bb4 we can either give black an exchange with 20.Kh2!? or continue a piece up with 20.Rb3 a5 21.Kh2 f6 22.Kg1 , with a continuous mess. If this is too messy for your taste, then 13.Bg5 makes a lot of sense as an alternative.

### (632) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #10 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...Ng6**

Delaying immediate action, just continuing with normal moves.

**11.Nbd2 Re8 12.h3**

Always useful. In the long run it is very rare that we can do without h3, but by delaying it until now we have dissuaded the earlier ...d5-ideas.

**12...h6**

is perfectly natural and I guess quite likely to be played in a game.

**13.Qc2**

Is usually a very good move in these positions. We overprotect the e4-pawn and prepare queenside expansion with b4.

**13...Be6 14.b4**

Continuing to expand. The more modest 14.b3 is also possible.

**14...a5 15.b5 Rc8**

Intends to put some pressure along the c-file, but

**16.bxc6**

is a good reply. After

**16...bxc6**

We are comfortably better in different ways, for instance...

**17.dxe5 Nxe5 18.Nxe5 dxe5 19.Nc4**

This gives us either an excellent knight on c4, or the bishop pair if Black takes it.

### (633) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #11 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...Ng6**

**11.Nbd2 Re8 12.h3**

**12...d5**

The critical test. Black is trying to liquidate everything in the centre.

**13.dxe5 Nxe5 14.exd5 Nxf3+ 15.Nxf3 Rxe1 16.Qxe1 Nxd5 17.a5**

Again a very useful resource.

**17...Bc7 18.Bg5 f6 19.Bd2**

This gives us an excellent initiative with c4 next.

### (634) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #12 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...Ng6**

**11.Nbd2 Re8 12.h3**

**12...d5**

**13.dxe5 Nxe5 14.exd5 Nxf3+ 15.Nxf3 Rxe1 16.Qxe1 Qxd5 17.c4**

17.Bg5 Be6 18.Bxf6 gxf6 19.b4 is also interesting, but probably the bishop pair is just about enough compensation for the weakened kingside.

**17...Qd8 18.a5 Bc7 19.b4**

Intending Bb2 gives us a nice initiative for free.

### (635) 29. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7,and 7...a6 - 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4 c6 #13 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6**

**7.Re1**

**7...Ne7**

**8.d4 Bb6 9.a4**

**9...c6**

**10.Bf1**

**10...Ng6**

**11.Nbd2 Re8 12.h3**

**12...d5**

**13.dxe5 Nxe5 14.exd5 Nxf3+ 15.Nxf3 Rxe1 16.Qxe1 Qxd5 17.c4**

**17...Qe4**

Black needs to stay as active as possible.

**18.a5**

18.Qc3!? keeps the queens on the board and is also an option. 18...Qe7 19.Bd3 intending b3, Bb2 is likely not an edge, but a playable position.

**18...Qxe1 19.Nxe1**

In the ending a draw is of course the favorite result, but we do keep some nagging pressure due to our advanced a-pawn and slight lead in development, for instance

**19...Bc5 20.Nd3 Bd4 21.Bf4**

Possibly followed by c5 and Ra4-b4. The b7-pawn is slightly vulnerable and our pieces slightly more active. It's very little, but not yet a draw.

### (636) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...h6 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 h6**

A slow-looking move, but not without ideas. Black is worried about 7...a6 8.Bxc6 bxc6 9.Bg5 so plays ...h6 first, with the idea of ...a6 on the next move.

**8.h3**

Now that Black has wasted a move on ... h6, the lines with ...Ne7 and a quick ...d5-push aren't really possible anymore. Therefore we can allow ourselves the luxury of including h3 before pushing in the centre.

**8...a6 9.Ba4**

9.Bxc6 is possible, and it could be argued that we have an improved version of similar positions, but simply retreating the bishop goes well with the rest of our repertoire.

**9...Ba7 10.Nbd2**

And this actually leads to our Ruy Lopez 5.d3 Repertoirewith 5...Bc5.<skip/>

### (637) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...h6 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 h6**

**8.h3**

**8...a6 9.Ba4**

**9...b5 10.Bc2**

As usual, we are retreating all the way to c2 once given the chance. Now we will play similarly to our 6.d3 b5 lines, with a4 putting pressure on Black's queenside.<skip/>

**10...Bb6 11.a4**

Is similar to what we have seen many times before in other chapters. For instance

**11...Rb8 12.Na3 b4 13.Nc4**

We will see a similar position in the mainline, in which Black did not waste a tempo on ... Bb6.

### (638) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...h6 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 h6**

**8.h3**

**8...a6 9.Ba4**

**9...b5 10.Bc2**

**10...d5**

Always has to be addressed as soon as we go with our bishop to c2 in one move.

**11.d4**

A very convincing antidote though.

**11...dxe4 12.Nxe5 Nxe5 13.dxe5**

Wins a pawn.

### (639) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...h6 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 h6**

**8.h3**

**8...a6 9.Ba4**

**9...b5 10.Bc2**

**10...Re8**

The most flexible move.

**11.a4 b4 12.d4 Ba7 13.d5**

Picks up the pawn on b4.

### (640) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...h6 #5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 h6**

**8.h3**

**8...a6 9.Ba4**

**9...b5 10.Bc2**

**10...Re8**

**11.a4 Rb8 12.Nbd2**

Before Black has played ...Bb6 it wouldn't make much sense to play Na3, as the b5-pawn is defended.

**12...Bb6**

is another reasonable way of playing now that Na3 no longer exists.

**13.axb5**

13.Nf1 b4 would be a little bit annoying as we no longer have Nc4.

**13...axb5 14.Nf1**

We intend to play d4 next, setting up a strong centre. There is nothing particularly wrong with Black's position, but we are also getting what we want.

### (641) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...h6 #6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 h6**

**8.h3**

**8...a6 9.Ba4**

**9...b5 10.Bc2**

**10...Re8**

**11.a4 Rb8 12.Nbd2**

**12...b4**

A smart move order by Black. By waiting for Nbd2 they avoided our d4-push.

**13.a5**

These kind of positions are more often reached in 6.d3 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 O-O 9.a4 b4. Black's bishop is a bit more active on c5 than e7, but we can still play in a similar fashion. Next up is Nc4 and Bd2, perhaps followed by Ba4 at some point. Another idea that could come into play at some point is Nh4 followed by Qf3 and Nf5. For instance<skip/>

**13...Bd7 14.Nc4 Ba7**

Prophylactic against d4.

**15.Bd2**

Just developing. 15.Be3 is also natural but trades off a few too many pieces.

**15...bxc3 16.bxc3 Ne7**

Would be a typical move, but it does allow

**17.d4**

With both d4 and e4 solidly protected we are enjoying a nice spatial edge.

### (642) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...h6 #7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 h6**

**8.h3**

**8...a6 9.Ba4**

**9...b5 10.Bc2**

**10...Re8**

**11.a4 Rb8 12.Nbd2**

**12...b4**

**13.a5**

**13...Bd7 14.Nc4 Ba7**

**15.Bd2**

**15...bxc3 16.bxc3 Rb5**

Black is putting some pressure on a5.

**17.Ba4 Rb7 18.Nh4**

Keeps a little pressure. The fundamental problem for Black is that ...d5 never really works, which makes it very hard to find a good plan.

### (643) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

Always a critical response in such positions when playing Re1 before h3. Black attacks f2, but more importantly opens up for the f-pawn.

**8.Re2 f5**

The logical follow-up to the previous move. Now the play gets quite sharp.

**9.exf5 Qf6**

Black is trying to stop d4 for the time being.

**10.Bxc6**

Giving up the bishop in order to force d4 through. 10.h3 Nxf2 11.Rxf2 Bxf2+ 12.Kxf2 is a bit similar to our line in the Open Spanish, but here it seems to be that Black's counterplay is a little bit more dangerous.

**10...bxc6 11.d4 exd4 12.cxd4 Bb6 13.h3**

Kicking the knight back.

**13...Nh6**

We have removed the intruders and there is no longer any question of us coming under an attack anymore. However, we had to give up the bishop pair to achieve it, meaning that Black is now doing fairly well strategically. Therefore we should act quickly.

**14.Qb3+ Kh8 15.Bg5**

Forcing Black to move the queen away from the defense of the h6-knight.

**15...Qxf5 16.Bxh6 gxh6 17.Nbd2**

Black's king is very hard to to get at on h8, but we still have some initiative. Rae1, enter on e7 and then the maneuver Ne4-g3 will put Black under pressure. With the bishop pair in return, it is certainly double-edged, but it seems our play is somewhat more dangerous. For instance

**17...Rg8 18.Re7**

Entering with the rook, intending to double on the 7th rank if allowed. 18.Rae1 or even the slower 18.Nf1 intending Ng3 are perfectly playable alternatives if the mainline looks too sharp.

**18...Qf6 19.Rae1 Bxh3**

Looks scary, but our attack is as strong as Black's.

**20.Rf7**

Ice cold!

**20...Rxg2+ 21.Kh1 Qg6**

The only reasonable square.

**22.Nh4 Qh5 23.Ree7 Bf5**

The only move to cover h7.

**24.Kxg2 Qxh4 25.Qg3 Rg8**

Forcing us to abandon the 7th rank with one rook.

**26.Rg7 Qxg3+ 27.Rxg3**

The forced play is over and we have emerged with an extra exchange. Black certainly has drawing chances, but we are definitely pushing for the win!

### (644) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

**8.Re2 f5**

**9.exf5 Bxf5**

is of course the most natural move, but makes it easier for us to push in the centre.

**10.d4 e4 11.Bg5**

Developing the bishop with tempo.

**11...Qd7 12.Nfd2 Bb6 13.h3**

Kicking the knight away, so that we can pick up the e4-pawn.

**13...Nf6 14.Bxf6 Rxf6 15.Nxe4**

Black does not have enough compensation for the pawn, especially as the bishop on b6 is biting into granite.

### (645) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

**8.Re2 f5**

**9.exf5 Bxf5**

**10.d4 Bb6 11.Bg5 Qe8 12.h3 Qh5 13.Nbd2**

Overprotecting f3. Now we are ready to take the knight next.

**13...h6 14.hxg4 Bxg4 15.Be3**

is a solid extra piece.

**15...e4**

This can't be taken due to Rxf3, but

**16.Nh2**

is very safe.

**16...Bxe2 17.Bxe2**

is not so bad for Black materially, but our pieces easily outweigh Black's rook.

### (646) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

**8.Re2 f5**

**9.exf5 Bxf5**

**10.d4 Bb6 11.Bg5 Qe8 12.h3 Qh5 13.Nbd2**

**13...Nf6 14.Bxf6 Rxf6 15.Ne4 Bxe4 16.Rxe4**

This is a typical good scenario for us. We have not won any material, but the b6-bishop is out of play and long term it is actually the black king that is more vulnerable.

### (647) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

**8.Re2 f5**

**9.exf5 Bxf5**

**10.d4 Bb6 11.Bg5 Qe8 12.h3 Qg6**

A c@nning try. Black is setting up a pin on the g-file (!).

**13.hxg4**

13.Nbd2 h6! now works for Black, as 14.hxg4 Bxg4 15.Be3 is met by 15...Bxf3 , and our g-pawn is pinned.

**13...Bxg4 14.Qd3**

This is the downside of having the queen on g6 - we can step out of the pin by tempo, as a queen trade would be winning for us.

**14...Bf5**

The only move to keep the pressure going.

**15.Qc4+ Kh8**

We can't hold onto the extra piece, but can give it back in return for a positional edge.

**16.Nbd2**

Black was actually threatening Bxb1 - something that is very easy to miss!

**16...e4 17.Bxc6 bxc6 18.Qxc6 exf3 19.Nxf3**

We have an extra pawn, but even that we are willing to give back in order to reach stability.

**19...Bg4 20.Bf4**

A smart move. The bishop will be an excellent defender on g3.

**20...Qf7**

Winning back the pawn.

**21.Bg3**

An excellent square for the bishop, covering our weakest pawn on f2.

**21...Bxf3 22.gxf3 Qxf3 23.Re4**

This is a long line, but it is due to this last move that I really wanted to add it. Black has been attacking us for the last 10-15 moves, and finally we get a chance to trade queens. But we don't! The reason is that once we have reached stability on the kingside we are simply having the more active position. The b6-bishop is still out of the game, we have control over the only open file and can switch to creating threats on the kingside. Furthermore, the queen on c6 is excellently placed on a light square.

### (648) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

**8.Re2 f5**

**9.exf5 Bxf5**

**10.d4 Bb6 11.Bg5 Qc8**

A strange square, but the idea is to avoid the pins.

**12.Nbd2**

A natural developing move, but it does give up control of the d4-pawn.

**12...exd4 13.Bxc6 d3 14.Bd5+**

is a very important intermediate check.

**14...Kh8 15.Re3**

Allowing Black to capture our rook, but the two pieces will easily outmatch the rook in the arising position.

### (649) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

**8.Re2 f5**

**9.exf5 Bxf5**

**10.d4 Bb6 11.Bg5 Qc8**

**12.Nbd2**

**12...exd4 13.Bxc6 bxc6 14.Qb3+**

Not allowing Black ...Be6-d5 later on.

**14...Kh8 15.cxd4**

Material equality is restored. Black has the bishop pair, but we control the e-file and the bishop on b6 is still pretty bad.

**15...h6**

Comes a bit too late, as

**16.Be7 Re8 17.Rae1**

Leaves us with a very strong bishop on e7.

### (650) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #8 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

**8.Re2 f5**

**9.exf5 Bxf5**

**10.d4 Bb6 11.Bg5 Qc8**

**12.Nbd2**

**12...h6**

The best move, forcing our bishop away.

**13.Bh4 exd4 14.cxd4**

Sacrificing a pawn. 14.Bxc6 as in the previous line is also possible, but then Black has got in the useful h6-move for free.

**14...Nxd4**

Black has to take, as there are no other reasonable moves.

**15.Nxd4 Bxd4**

A very interesting position. All our pieces are active and we have possibilities to launch an attack using the e7-square, but it is quite hard to prove anything concrete.

**16.h3**

Going for activity. 16.Nf3 Bb6 17.Be7 would win an exchange, but Black seems to get just about enough counterplay with accurate play.

**16...Ne5 17.Nc4**

is very good, as both d4 and e5 are hanging.

### (651) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #9 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

**8.Re2 f5**

**9.exf5 Bxf5**

**10.d4 Bb6 11.Bg5 Qc8**

**12.Nbd2**

**12...h6**

**13.Bh4 exd4 14.cxd4**

**14...Nxd4**

**15.Nxd4 Bxd4**

**16.h3**

**16...Nf6 17.Ne4**

An interesting tactical move, trading off some defenders. 17.Nf3 Bb6 18.Bxf6 Rxf6 19.Re8+ would win the queen, but Black is too likely to be able to set up a fortress.

**17...Bxe4 18.Qxd4 Bg6 19.Bc4+ Kh8 20.Re7**

Gives us huge compensation for the pawn.

### (652) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Ng4 #10 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Ng4**

**8.Re2 f5**

**9.exf5 Bxf5**

**10.d4 Bb6 11.Bg5 Qc8**

**12.Nbd2**

**12...h6**

**13.Bh4 exd4 14.cxd4**

**14...Nxd4**

**15.Nxd4 Bxd4**

**16.h3**

**16...Nf6 17.Ne4**

**17...Bxe4 18.Qxd4 d5**

The only move. Black is willing to give back the extra pawn in order to force trades.

**19.f3 Bg6 20.Re7**

Winning back the pawn with 20.Bxf6 Rxf6 21.Qxd5+ is certainly also possible. We would have slightly the safer king and more active position, but the Black position is very solid and the game would likely be close to equal. Instead we are trying to play for long term compensation with the e-file and the bishop pair. With good defense Black should probably be OK, but it looks much easier for White to play.

### (653) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 Ne7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

This is one of the best moves for Black. Voluntarily retreating the bishop looks odd, but we have frequently seen the d4-push being very strong due to attacking the c5-bishop.

**8.a4**

A v@ry direct reaction to 7...Bb6, actually threatening to trap the bishop! Normally, 8.Nbd2 is a good reaction against ...Bb6, but here it runs into 8...Ng4! and Black has an improved version of the 7...Ng4 lines, as there we didn't want to commit our knight to d2 so early. The alternative move 8.h3 stopping any Ng4, gives Black time for 8...Ne7 and after 9.d4 d5! we are back to the position we are trying to avoid by playing 7.Re1 instead of 7.h3.

**8...Ne7 9.d4**

�@� Transposes to 7...Ne7 8.d4 Bb6 9.a4

### (654) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 Ng4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...Ng4 9.d4**

works well for us now. The key point is

**9...exd4 10.h3 Nge5 11.Bxc6**

Very important. Normally this would be completely fine for Black after bxc6, but here we are still threatening a5!

**11...Nxc6**

11...bxc6 12.a5 just wins the bishop.

**12.cxd4**

Is just great for us. Black has lost too much time and our centre is solid.

### (655) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a5 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a5**

This is interesting, but as so often the inclusion of a4 a5 favours us. I have said it before, but the two main reasons are: the bishop is more vulnerable on b6 after a Nbd2-c4 and our rook can enter the game via a3.

**9.h3 Ne7**

Black plays as if a4 a5 isn't included.

**10.d4 d5 11.exd5**

Normally not the way we want to capture, but here it makes a lot of sense.

**11...e4 12.Ng5**

Will just pick up the e4-pawn for free.

### (656) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a5 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a5**

**9.h3 Ne7**

**10.d4 d5 11.exd5**

**11...exd4 12.Bg5**

Forcing Black to choose with what to recapture on d5.

**12...Nexd5 13.cxd4 h6 14.Bh4**

Is @ typical sort of position where the isolated pawn is pretty strong. We have a nice outpost for our knight on e5, and the h4-d8 pin is quite annoying for Black (the bishop is far away on b6). Next, we can play Nc3, Bc4 and Qb3, while waiting for a good moment to jump Ne5.

**14...Qd6 15.Nbd2**

Shows one reason why a4 a5 is beneficial for us.

### (657) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a5 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a5**

**9.h3 Ne7**

**10.d4 d5 11.exd5**

**11...exd4 12.Bg5**

**12...Nfxd5**

Generally the most solid move, as the pin against the e7-knight is easier to handle.

**13.cxd4**

13.Bc4!? sacrificing a pawn for the initiative is also a tempting alternative.

**13...h6 14.Bh4 Qd6 15.Nbd2**

This is again good for us.

### (658) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a5 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a5**

**9.h3 Ne7**

**10.d4 d5 11.exd5**

**11...exd4 12.Bg5**

**12...Nfxd5**

**13.cxd4**

**13...h6 14.Bh4 Be6 15.Nc3 Qd6**

Stepping out of the pin. 15...Qc8 does not step into the Ne4-threat, but loses control over vital central squares. 16.Bxe7! Acting immediately, before Black has time for ...c6.16...Nxe7 17.d5 is the point. Due to the problems on the e-file, Black has to go for the tactical operation 17...Nxd5 18.Nxd5 Bxd5 19.Qxd5 c6 , but after 20.Bxc6 Black will have no compensation for the weak c-pawn, with or without queens on the board.

**16.Ne4 Qb4 17.Ra3**

Shows another way a4 a5 helps us. The threat of Rb3 trapping the queen is surprisingly difficult to deal with!

### (659) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a5 #5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a5**

**9.h3 Ne7**

**10.d4 d5 11.exd5**

**11...exd4 12.Bg5**

**12...Nfxd5**

**13.cxd4**

**13...h6 14.Bh4 c6**

The most solid move. Black reinforces the d5-point.

**15.Bc4 Qd6 16.Bxe7**

Giving up the bishop in order to assert dominance on the light squares. 16.Bg3 keeping all pieces on the board is a decent alternative.

**16...Nxe7 17.Nbd2 Nd5 18.Ne4 Qd8 19.Ne5**

gives us a rather dangerous attack!

### (660) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a5 #6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a5**

**9.h3 Ne7**

**10.d4 d5 11.exd5**

**11...exd4 12.Bg5**

**12...Nfxd5**

**13.cxd4**

**13...h6 14.Bh4 c6**

**15.Bc4 Qd6 16.Bxe7**

**16...Nxe7 17.Nbd2 Bf5**

The most solid move. Black is ready to give up the bishop pair to ease the pressure.

**18.Qb3 Nd5 19.Ne4 Bxe4 20.Rxe4**

We have a slight initiative. The opposite coloured bishops favour us, as the d4-pawn securely blocks the dark-squared one, whereas our bishop can attack both d5 and f7. Additionally, we control the only open file. Black is of course solid, but it does look like a pleasant little something for us.

### (661) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a6 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a6 9.Bxc6**

Now we take, but having included a4 and a6 makes it possible for us to play against the b6-bishop.

**9...bxc6 10.a5**

Our idea is that Black's bishop is out of play on a7. For the time being it sounds strange as the diagonal a7-g1 looks useful, but the thing is that in order to prevent us from going d4 long term Black will have to ...c5 at some point. And once c5 is played, the bishop is really struggling on a7.

**10...Ba7 11.h3**

Just calmly completing development, preventing any Ng4 followed by f5 ideas.

**11...Re8 12.Nbd2 Rb8**

12...h6 13.Nf1 Rb8 14.Ng3 transposes to the same line.

**13.Nf1 h6 14.Ng3**

Now we are ready for d4 next.

**14...c5 15.Be3**

Excellent timing! By use of tactics we can develop in the most harmonious way.

**15...Rxb2 16.Qc1**

A surprising double attack!

**16...Rb7 17.Bxh6 gxh6 18.Qxh6**

gives us a winning attack!

### (662) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a6 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a6 9.Bxc6**

**9...bxc6 10.a5**

**10...Ba7 11.h3**

**11...Re8 12.Nbd2 Rb8**

**13.Nf1 h6 14.Ng3**

**14...c5 15.Be3**

**15...d5**

Black probably should play something like this, but we don't have to react.

**16.Qc1**

Is a good reply. Black will likely have to push ...d4 at some point, but then the bishop on a7 is really out of play. We will likely prepare either the b4-break, or close the queenside with c4 and switch to the kingside, where we will be able to push f4 after moves like Rf1 and Nh2.

### (663) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a6 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a6 9.Bxc6**

**9...bxc6 10.a5**

**10...Ba7 11.h3**

**11...Re8 12.Nbd2 Rb8**

**13.Nf1 d5**

looks active, but is not well-timed at all.

**14.exd5 Qxd5**

The only move, as e5 needs protection.

**15.Ng3 h6**

stops Bg5, but now comes an idea that is well worth remembering.

**16.Ra4**

Intending Rh4, with a strong kingside attack! The threat of a bishop sacrifice on h6 will be very unpleasant for Black to stop.

### (664) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a6 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a6 9.Bxc6**

**9...bxc6 10.a5**

**10...Ba7 11.h3**

**11...Re8 12.Nbd2 Rb8**

**13.Nf1 c5 14.Ng3 Be6**

Black is not worried about the pin and develops naturally.

**15.Bg5 h6**

The only move.

**16.Bh4 g5 17.Nxg5 hxg5 18.Bxg5**

is winning for us, as Black can't keep f6 defended.

### (665) 30. Anti-Berlin 6...d6 7.Re1 7 - 7...Bb6 8.a4 a6 #5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.Re1 Bb6**

**8.a4**

**8...a6 9.Bxc6**

**9...bxc6 10.a5**

**10...Ba7 11.h3**

**11...Re8 12.Nbd2 Rb8**

**13.Nf1 c5 14.Ng3 Be6**

**15.Bg5 h6**

**16.Bh4 Kh7 17.Nh5 Rg8**

The only move, as Black needs to be ready on the g-file as soon as we take on f6. The position is now quite sharp and we have many interesting moves. Generally speaking we are trying to make something happen on the kingside while the bishop is stuck on a7.

**18.Bxf6**

18.Nxf6+ is also tempting.

**18...gxf6 19.Kh2**

Preventing Bxh3 and preparing Nh4. As Black, I would be really worried.

**19...Rxb2**

wins a pawn but is too greedy, as the b-pawn doesn't really matter.

**20.Re2**

We have excellent compensation. One of our knights will land on f5, where it can never be kicked away.

### (438) 21. 3rd Move Alternatives - 3...d6 #1

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 d6**

This is the real Steinitz defense, but it does not really make much sense as we can grab the centre immediately.

**4.d4**

We take the opportunity to push in the centre immediately. Without the inclusion of ...a6 Ba4 Black doesn't have the option of ...b5 here, meaning that e5 is very hard to defend.

**4...Bd7 5.Bxc6**

Looks slightly surprising, but is in fact quite smart. We give the bishop pair, but gain a lot of time in return.

**5...Bxc6 6.Nc3**

Again the problem for Black is that the e5-pawn can't be defended in a good way.

**6...exd4**

6...Nf6 7.Qe2 exd4 8.Nxd4 transposes into the same line.

**7.Nxd4 Nf6 8.Qe2**

Defending e4, but also preparing O-O-O.

**8...Be7 9.Be3**

Fol@owed by O-O-O gives us a huge attack for free. The reason our attack is so strong is that we have firm control over the centre, making it very hard for Black to transfer their pieces between the kingside and queenside. Note, the pawn is tactically protected as 9...Nxe4?? loses material to 10.Nxc6 Nxc3 11.Nxd8 Nxe2 12.Nxb7 Rb8 13.Na5 Rxb2 14.Kxe2 and 9...Bxe4 is also markedly worse for Black after 10.Nxe4 Nxe4 11.Qb5+ Kf8 12.Qxb7 .

### (439) 21. 3rd Move Alternatives - 3...d6 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 d6**

**4.d4**

**4...exd4 5.Nxd4 Bd7**

This kind of play was fairly popular some 100 years ago, but to the modern eye Black has just given up the centre without getting anything at all in return.

**6.O-O**

Calmly developing.

**6...Nf6 7.Nc3 Nxd4 8.Bxd7+ Qxd7 9.Qxd4**

Does not change much. Theoretically the trade of two sets of pieces makes our space advantage less valuable, but it is still there and Black has no way of ever breaking free. Just developing our pieces and grabbing more space should increase our advantage in the long run.

### (440) 21. 3rd Move Alternatives - 3...d6 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 d6**

**4.d4**

**4...exd4 5.Nxd4 Bd7**

**6.O-O**

**6...Nf6 7.Nc3 Be7 8.Nxc6**

A simple solution. Keeping the tension is also possible and definitely better for White, but I like to clarify our structural advantage immediately.

**8...bxc6 9.Bd3 O-O 10.f4**

Black has both a passive position and structural problems. Meanwhile, our kingside attack will flow very naturally with moves like Qf3, Be3 and Rae1, perhaps one day followed by the e5-break.

### (441) 21. 3rd Move Alternatives - 3...d6 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 d6**

**4.d4**

**4...exd4 5.Nxd4 Bd7**

**6.O-O**

**6...Nf6 7.Nc3 Be7 8.Nxc6**

**8...Bxc6 9.Bxc6+ bxc6 10.f4**

Grabbing more space.

**10...O-O 11.Qf3**

The position is very pleasant for us. Next, we develop our bishop to e3 or b2, bring the a1-rook into the game and then start active play on the kingside. Meanwhile Black is unable to generate any meaningful counterplay due to the lack of space.

### (34) Quickstarter Guide - Jaenisch Gambit #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

The Jaenisch Gambit. Black attacks the centre immediately and the long-term strategic idea is to trade a non-central pawn for a central one, like a Sicilian. Unlike ...c5 in the Sicilian, the move ...f5 in the Jaenisch Gambit does weaken both the a2-g8 diagonal and the 7th rank, so it is a very risky decision. It was for a long time not seen at the highest level, but some ~10 years ago Radjabov started to play it almost regularly in the top events, and it made a comeback. However, the burst of popularity seems to have gone again, as White has found some very convincing ways not only to get an edge, but also take all fun out of Black's position.

**4.d3**

Solidifying our e4-pawn.

**4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O Bc5**

Traditionally this was the mainline, but it does look pretty depressing for Black.

**7.Bxc6**

Picking up a pawn.

**7...bxc6 8.Nxe5 O-O**

For the pawn, Black has a nice bishop pair, but our position is too solid to be seriously worried about that.

**9.Nc3 d6 10.Na4**

Is the key move, forcing the trade of one of the bishops.

**10...Qe8 11.Nd3**

The c5-bishop is still trapped. Without the bishop pair Black won't have enough compensation for the pawn, although we still need to be a bit careful.

### (35) Quickstarter Guide - Jaenisch Gambit #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**4.d3**

**4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O d6 7.Bc4**

Very important. We make sure Black will never be able to castle short.

**7...Bg4 8.h3**

Useful, to have the option of breaking the pin with g4 later on, if necessary.

**8...Bh5 9.Nc3 Nd4**

9...Be7 is Sethuraman's suggestion in his Chessable course. 10.a3!? is the recommendation covered in the course. We prepare Qd3 without being hit by ...Nb4. Additionally, a3 supports a later b4 advance, which we will use to attack if Black castles long. Against 9...Qd7 , intending to castle long, 10.Nd5! O-O-O 11.Qd3 is the best setup. We have excellent central control, and can start actions on the queenside. The most natural and straightforward idea now is to push a4-a5-a6, creating very unpleasant pressure against Black's king.

**10.g4**

Looks scary at first sight but Black does not have enough development to really attack.

### (412) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...Nf6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**4.d3**

Undoubtedly the mainline nowadays. 4.Nc3 used to be most popular and is also interesting, but 4.d3 makes sure that we are always able to recapture with a pawn on e4, never giving up central control.

**4...Nf6 5.exf5**

is possible now that Black no longer has ...e4.

**5...d6**

Here many moves are very good for White, for example

**6.O-O Bxf5 7.d4**

opening up the centre long before Black's king can escape.

### (413) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O Bc5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**4.d3**

**4...fxe4**

Played by everyone.

**5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O**

Now Black has an important choice. The move Bc5 is generally the more solid choice, when Black often ends up giving up a pawn for positional compensation. Much sharper is d6, in which Black intends to castle long and go all out against our king.

**6...Bc5 7.Bxc6**

Immediately going for the pawn.

**7...bxc6 8.Nxe5 Nxe4 9.Qh5+**

wins immediately.

### (414) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O Bc5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**4.d3**

**4...fxe4**

**5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O**

**6...Bc5 7.Bxc6**

**7...bxc6 8.Nxe5 O-O**

Black has a fairly strong bishop pair and an open f-file as compensation for the missing pawn. A big advantage for us is that we lack clear weaknesses and targets for attack, which makes it very hard for Black to get some tangible for the activity.

**9.Nc3**

Protecting e4, but also getting ready to kick back the annoying c5-bishop with Na4 at an appropriate moment.

**9...Ba6 10.Nd3 Bb6**

Is another way for Black to play, but this gives us a chance to trade one of the bishops immediately.

**11.Be3**

Not necessary, but I like it. We get ugly doubled e-pawns, but all pressure against f2 disappears and with it all Black's activity.

**11...Bxe3 12.fxe3 Qe7 13.Rf4**

The rook is very well placed on f4, as Black can't ever kick it away, making the e4-pawn well protected. Next, we can play Qf3 and bring the a1-rook to f1, starting active play on our own.

### (415) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O Bc5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**4.d3**

**4...fxe4**

**5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O**

**6...Bc5 7.Bxc6**

**7...bxc6 8.Nxe5 O-O**

**9.Nc3**

**9...d6 10.Na4**

A key move! We make sure to trade off the annoying c5-bishop, at the same time keeping our extra pawn.

**10...Bb6 11.Nxc6**

leaves us with a fairly solid extra pawn.

**11...Qe8 12.Nxb6 axb6 13.Nd4 Qxe4 14.f3**

A good move, preempting any ideas of Black on the long diagonal. Next, we can either play a4 to fight for the light squares on the queenside, or simply develop with b3, Bb2, or Bd2. Black has some drawing chances for the pawn, but not more than that.

### (416) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O Bc5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**4.d3**

**4...fxe4**

**5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O**

**6...Bc5 7.Bxc6**

**7...bxc6 8.Nxe5 O-O**

**9.Nc3**

**9...d6 10.Na4**

**10...Qe8**

The most testing move, and the recommendation of Sethuraman in his Chessable course on the Jaenisch!

**11.Nd3 Nxe4**

was tried once by Radjabov against Caruana, but very uninspiring.

**12.Naxc5 Nxc5 13.Nxc5 dxc5 14.Be3**

Material equality is restored, but Black is very likely to lose one of the c-pawns. The other c-pawn on c6 restricts the c8-bishop and Black has no compensation for it.

### (417) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O Bc5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**7...bxc6 8.Nxe5 O-O**

**9.Nc3**

**9...d6 10.Na4**

**10...Qe8**

**11.Nd3 Bg4**

Gaining a tempo, although we win it back later with f3.11...Bd4 immediately is similar, although a very slightly worse version for Black after 12.c3 .

**12.Qe1 Bd4**

Provoking us to put another pawn on the same colour as our bishop.

**13.c3**

And we oblige. The most important thing is to trade off one of the bishops.

**13...Bb6 14.Nxb6 axb6 15.f3**

Kicking the bishop away, and placing our pawn on the correct colour.

**15...Be6 16.a3**

Simply saving our a2-pawn. Although Black has sacrificed a pawn, the position isn't very forcing in nature. Rather, Black is trying to demontrade positional compensation due to our weak light squares. But we don't have any clear targets for attack, and our king is very safe with so many pawns in front of it, that I struggle to believe Black can have full compensation.

**16...Bc4**

Immediately attacking our light squares.

**17.Qd1**

Next, if allowed, we want to play Re1 to step out of the c4-f1 pin. Thereafter developing with Be3, possibly followed by improving the knight to f4 or f2. But very important is to not hurry and be observant of Black's counterplay. Once we have full control, there will be ways to start our own play later on.

**17...Qg6**

Does not make too much sense, as we will get a tempo with Nf4.

**18.Re1 \***

**15...Be6 16.a3**

**16...Bc4**

**17.Qd1**

**17...Qf7 18.Re1 Nd7**

this is the other idea Black have: trading on d3, followed by ...c5-c4 and establishing a knight on d3.

**19.Be3 c5 20.Nc1**

is an interesting antidote, intending to kick the annoying bishop away with b3 next.

### (419) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O Bc5

**15...Be6 16.a3**

**16...Bc4**

**17.Qd1**

**17...Qf7 18.Re1 Bb3**

Sethuraman's move, trying to disturb our coordination.

**19.Qe2 Nh5 20.Be3 c5**

Black has some compensation here, as our queenside pawns are all fixed on dark squares and it's hard for us to advance on the kingside. That being said, Black struggles to create play of their own, and we can slowly improve our position.

**21.Nf2**

is one way of playing I like quite a lot. The knight is going to g4, if needed supported by a pawn on h3, after which Black will always have to take the e5-break into account. The most natural way to stop it is by Rae8, but that allows us to push a4-a5, getting rid of our a-pawn and activating our rook. All in all, we have to act with quite some patience, but there is no doubt that in the long run we are having all the chances.

### (420) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O d6 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**4.d3**

**4...fxe4**

**5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O**

**6...d6**

Black simply defends the e5-pawn, but in doing so the f8-bishop gets locked in.

**7.Bc4**

A key move. For the time being Ng5 is a threat, but the more important point is that Black will no longer be able to castle short.

**7...Bg4 8.h3**

A good inclusion, as the possibility of a later g4 is useful. Generally, we should always be hesitant about moving the pawns in front of our own king when our opponent is intending to castle on the opposite side, but in this case Black is simply too slow at creating counterplay.

**8...Bh5 9.Nc3 Nd4**

was used once by Aronian to beat Caruana, but it's highly dubious.

**10.g4**

Shows why we needed to include h3.

**10...Nxf3+ 11.Qxf3 Bg6 12.g5**

Deviating from Caruana's play. Black is simply too far behind in development to survive. Next up with can either move the queen and push f4, or march with the h-pawn to h5. Another useful idea to keep in mind is Be6-g4, especially if Black puts their knight on h5.

### (421) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O d6 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**4.d3**

**4...fxe4**

**5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O**

**6...d6**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Bg4 8.h3**

**8...Bh5 9.Nc3 Qd7**

The main move, but very ropey objectively speaking. Black is intending to castle long, but the problem is that the king is very vulnerable also on the queenside, as we can push our a- and b-pawns quickly.

**10.Nd5**

Making use of some small tactics to get our pieces where we want them.

**10...Nxe4**

does not work out well for Black.

**11.Nxe5**

The simplest, immediately regaining the pawn and winning the bishop pair in the process.

**11...Bxd1 12.Nxd7 Kxd7 13.Rxd1**

We have a significant edge with the bishop pair in an open position.

### (422) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O d6 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**4.d3**

**4...fxe4**

**5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O**

**6...d6**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Bg4 8.h3**

**8...Bh5 9.Nc3 Qd7**

**10.Nd5**

**10...O-O-O 11.Qd3**

This is our setup. We move out of the pin and are now ready to push our queenside pawns. As we have such nice central control it's very difficult for Black to generate counterplay, while our own attack quickly becomes very strong.

**11...Kb8 12.a4**

Starting the attack. 12.b4 is similar and also very promising.

**12...Ne7**

Tried in a high level correspondence game.

**13.Ng5**

Getting ready for the e6-square in case Black trades on d5.

**13...Bg6 14.Qe2**

In the game White played more forcingly with 14.Nxf6 gxf6 15.Nf7 , but I believe this is a bit simpler. Next, we simply continue with our pawn march on the queenside, and Black lacks counterplay.

### (423) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O d6 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O**

**6...d6**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Bg4 8.h3**

**8...Bh5 9.Nc3 Qd7**

**10.Nd5**

**10...O-O-O 11.Qd3**

**11...Kb8 12.a4**

**12...Bg6**

Looks natural, but does not really solve any problems.

**13.Re1 Nxd5 14.Qxd5**

14.Bxd5 Nb4 should be avoided.

**14...Be7 15.Ra3**

is a very useful idea to remember. The rook goes to b3, after which the b7-pawn is quite hard to defend. 15.a5 a6 16.Qd3 is less forcing, and a good alternative.

**15...Nb4**

Is the only move to try to disturb our harmony, but the tactics works out in our favour.

**16.Qd2 Rhf8**

Was tried in Schakel-Reinhart, correspondence 2020, but looks very dodgy.

**17.Qxb4**

Picking up the gauntlet. Slower moves like 17.Rb3 are also promising.

**17...d5**

Black's idea.

**18.Qc3**

Deviating from the correspondence game, where the queen went to a5.

**18...dxc4 19.Nxe5 Qe6 20.Nxg6 hxg6 21.Ra1**

leaves us a pawn up for very little compensation. Our queen is simply better placed on c3 than a5. Next, we can even transfer it to g3, covering our kingside.

### (424) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O d6 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**16.Qd2 Rhf8**

**17.Qxb4**

**17...d5**

**18.Qc3**

**18...Bxa3 19.Bb5**

is a nice zwischenzug.

**19...c6 20.Nxe5 Qd6 21.bxa3 cxb5 22.Nxg6**

The tactics have ended and we are emerging with two pawns and a strong initiative after capturing b5 on the next move. If you still prefer to avoid all of these tactics, then for instance 15.a5 would be a simple alternative.

### (425) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.Dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O d6 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**4.d3**

**4...fxe4**

**5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O**

**6...d6**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Bg4 8.h3**

**8...Bh5 9.Nc3 Be7**

Sethuraman's suggestion, as the lines with 9...Qd7 are looking too scary for Black. By blocking the e-file Black takes the sting out of our Nd5-idea, as it can now be met safely by Nxe4.

**10.a3**

An interesting move. We prepare Qd3 without being disturbed by any ...Nb4, and long-term a3 is of course useful as we are intending on pushing our queenside pawns. It looks a bit slow, but if Black is going for the O-O-O option then ...Be7 is also not a move that helps too much, especially as it takes a the e7-square for the knight. 10.g4 is the sharper option, which seems strong but also very, very messy.

**10...Qd7 11.Qd3 O-O-O 12.b4**

Is still very nice for us. One problem for Black is that the c6-knight has no good squares after b5 next.

**12...Rhf8 13.b5 Na5 14.Ba2**

Is great for us. The a5-knight can be attacked with a4 Ba3-b4, but mainly it's very difficult for Black to get fast counterplay.

### (426) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.Dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O d6 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**4.d3**

**4...fxe4**

**5.dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O**

**6...d6**

**7.Bc4**

**7...Bg4 8.h3**

**8...Bh5 9.Nc3 Be7**

**10.a3**

**10...Nd4**

The critical move, forcing us to play g4.

**11.g4 Nxf3+ 12.Qxf3**

This is a slightly better version of 9...Nd4 for Black, as Be7 is more useful than a3. But I still believe it to be very promising, for the same reasons as above.

**12...Bg6 13.g5**

Even 13.Qe2!? intending f3 looks promising.

**13...Nh5 14.Qg4**

Covers the g5-pawn and prepares to meet Qd7 with Be6. Black's kin will be stuck in the centre forever.

**14...Rf8 15.Ne2**

stops ...Nf4, leaving Black without counterplay.

### (427) 20. Jaenisch Gambit - 4...fxe4 5.Dxe4 Nf6 6.O-O d6 # 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5**

**8...Bh5 9.Nc3 Be7**

**10.a3**

**10...Nd4**

**11.g4 Nxf3+ 12.Qxf3**

**12...Bg6 13.g5**

**13...Nd7 14.Qg3 c6**

Getting the b6-square for the queen in case we push f4 immediately.

**15.b4**

15.f4 exf4 16.Bxf4 Qb6+ 17.Kh2 is also not a real concern for us, but as we need b4 for later anyway it makes sense to play it immediately.

**15...Qc7 16.f4 exf4 17.Bxf4**

We are doing fantastically. The pawn on g5 prevents Bf6 and can't be attacked. As soon as Black castles long we push b5, with a huge attack. I doubt Black will survive this for long.

### (432) 21. 3rd Move Alternatives - 3...Bc5 4.c3 Nge7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Bc5**

This is a rare guest in top level practice, but still seen from time to time as a surprise weapon. Black is intending ... Nd4 to trade a set of knights.

**4.c3 Nge7**

has@been played by a few world-class players, but generally only in blitz. It's similar to 3...a6 4.Ba4 Bc5 5.c3 Nge7 , but it's beneficial for Black to include a6 Ba4, as it gives the c5-bishop a nice square on a7.

**5.O-O**

Again we delay d4 not to give Black a check on b4.

**5...Bb6 6.d4 exd4 7.cxd4 d5**

This has actually been played quite a bit, but it's a fairly bad version of similar lines.

**8.exd5 Nxd5 9.Re1+ Be6 10.Bg5 Qd6 11.Nbd2**

is the typical way to proceed in such positions. The knight comes to e4 or c4, kicking the queen away after which we take on c6, settling Black with a bad doubled pawn. For instance

**11...O-O 12.Nc4 Qb4 13.a4 a6 14.Bxc6 bxc6 15.Rc1**

is close to winning for White already. The pawn on c6 is weak and the b6-bishop very passive.

### (36) Quickstarter Guide - Cozio Defence #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nge7**

Thi@ is known as the Cozio Defence, and is the most important deviation from the mainlines. It has also been recommended by both Erwin L'Ami and Simon Williams in their respective Chessable courses. 4.c3 d5 is the point, which is quite OK for Black. 4.O-O would not get into our mainlines, as after for example 4...g6 5.c3 a6 6.Ba4 Bg7 7.d4 exd4 8.cxd4 b5 9.Bc2 d5 we have already committed to castling, which is something we want to delay.

**4.Nc3**

A good reply. We want to push d4 next.

**4...g6**

Logical, and the recommendation of Simon Williams in his Chessable course.

**5.d4 exd4 6.Nxd4**

According to L'Ami, this leads to a pleasant edge for White. I can only agree! 6.Nd5 is sharper, but exactly the sort of thing Black hopes for when trying to be provocative with 3...Nge7.

**6...Bg7 7.Be3 O-O 8.Nxc6**

This is the line given by L'Ami. By taking on c6 already here we make it harder for Black to push ...d5.

**8...bxc6 9.Ba4**

This structure is very nice for us. Next, we can either play Qd2 and castle long, or Bd4, trading off Black's only good piece.

**9...d5**

Looks like it gives counterplay, but is very strongly met by

**10.Bc5**

Creating all sorts of unpleasant pins.

### (37) Quickstarter Guide - Cozio Defence #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nge7**

**4.Nc3**

**4...Ng6**

L'Ami's recommendation.

**5.d4**

It's possible to play more ambitiously with 5.h4 , but again I prefer to meet provocations with solid, central play.

**5...exd4 6.Nxd4 Nxd4**

L'Ami's suggestion and definitely the most solid move.

**7.Qxd4 c6 8.Be2**

8.Bc4 b5!? gets too messy for my taste.

**8...Qb6**

Trying to either trade queens to ease up on the pressure, or kick it away from d4 and develop the f8-bishop.

**9.Qd3**

Keeping the queens. We have a slight space advantage and a small, but very safe edge. Next up, we just castle and develop naturally. The push a4-a5 to force the Black queen back is often a good idea as well.

### (375) 19. Cozio & Delayed Cozio Defe - 3...Nge7 4.Nc3 g6 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

In this chapter we will have a look at systems in which Black plays ...g6 and Nge7. There are many different move orders for Black to reach that setup, so we have to be a bit careful not to get tricked into something we don't want. Most of Black's different move orders are aimed at limiting White's options, but luckily we are anyway trying to play the same setup whenever possible.

**3...Nge7**

Thi@ is known as the Cozio Defence, and is the most important deviation from the mainlines. It has also been recommended by both Erwin L'Ami and Simon Williams in their respective Chessable courses. 4.c3 d5 is the point, which is quite OK for Black. 4.O-O would not get into our mainlines, as after for example 4...g6 5.c3 a6 6.Ba4 Bg7 7.d4 exd4 8.cxd4 b5 9.Bc2 d5 we have already committed to castling, which is something we want to delay.

**4.Nc3**

Therefore we have to treat the line independently, and then 4. Nc3 is the best move. The point is to play d4 next, but first force Black to make a decision.

**4...g6**

**5.d4 exd4 6.Nxd4**

**6...Bg7 7.Be3 O-O 8.Nxc6**

Is the line given by L'Ami. By taking on c6 already here we make it harder for Black to push ...d5.

**8...Nxc6 9.Qd2**

Intending O-O-O and h4-h5. With such nice control of the centre we do not have to fear any counterattack by Black.

### (376) 19. Cozio & Delayed Cozio Defe - 3...Nge7 4.Nc3 g6 #2

**5.d4 exd4 6.Nxd4**

**6...Bg7 7.Be3 O-O 8.Nxc6**

**8...bxc6 9.Ba4 d6**

is too passive.

**10.Qd2**

followed by O-O-O gives us a dangerous attack. 10.Bd4 trading Black's only good piece is a more positional but also very strong move.

### (377) 19. Cozio & Delayed Cozio Defe - 3...Nge7 4.Nc3 g6 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**5.d4 exd4 6.Nxd4**

**6...Bg7 7.Be3 O-O 8.Nxc6**

**8...bxc6 9.Ba4 d5 10.Bc5**

is the tactical point. Due to the pin Black can't really do anything in the centre and is rather left with only weaknesses.

### (378) 19. Cozio & Delayed Cozio Defe - 3...Nge7 4.Nc3 d6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

simply allows

after which we have a nice edge.

**5...a6 6.Be2 exd4 7.Nxd4 Nxd4 8.Qxd4 Nc6 9.Qd3**

was Pruijssers-Trent, 2015. The fact that the game ended in a draw had more to do with Trent's great practical playing strength rather than the current position. We have a very solid space advantage and can choose to castle on either side.

### (379) 19. Cozio & Delayed Cozio Defe - 3...Nge7 4.Nc3 Ng6 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5**

**3...Nge7**

**4.Nc3**

**4...Ng6**

L'Ami's suggestion.

**5.d4**

**5...exd4 6.Nxd4 Bc5**

does trade an extra set of pieces, but leaves Black very passive.

**7.Be3 Bxd4 8.Bxd4 Qg5**

was actually tried in Nepomniachtchi-Carlsen, 2020, but isn't great.

**9.g3 Nxd4 10.Qxd4 Ne5 11.Be2 Nc6 12.Qc4**

Gave Nepomniachtchi a very nice edge in the game. Again, Black has no compensation for the lack of space.

### (380) 19. Cozio & Delayed Cozio Defe - 3...Nge7 4.Nc3 Ng6 #2

**7.Qxd4 c6 8.Be2**

**8...Qb6**

**9.Qd3**

We should keep the queens on the board, as we have a space advantage.

**9...Be7 10.O-O O-O 11.a4**

We have a small space advantage, but the Black position is solid. a4 is a good way of increasing the pressure, as we will be able to push back Black's annoying queen from b6, after which we can continue with calm development. L'Ami believes it's playable for Black, and I believe White is slightly better. The two things don't necessarily contradict each other, but I'd just like to add that it's very playable for White as well!

**11...d6 12.a5**

I don't think we need to know any more theory here, but let's anyway have a look at some lines.

**12...Qc7 13.f4**

Increasing our space advantage.

**13...f5 14.Qc4+ Kh8 15.Nd5**

picks up the bishop pair. In the semi-open position that arises it will definitely be of some value to us.

**11...d6 12.a5**

**12...Qc7 13.f4**

**13...Bd7 14.Be3 Rfe8 15.Qc4**

A nice way of disturbing Black's coordination a bit.

**15...Rac8**

This does not work.

**16.Bxa7**

There is no way to trap the bishop, so this is just a healthy extra pawn.

### (382) 19. Cozio & Delayed Cozio Defe - 3...Nge7 4.Nc3 Ng6 #4

**11...d6 12.a5**

**12...Qc7 13.f4**

**13...Bd7 14.Be3 Rfe8 15.Qc4**

**15...Qc8**

The best move, but looks a bit clumsy.

**16.Rad1 b5**

Gaining at least some sort of counterplay.

**17.axb6 axb6 18.Bxb6 Rb8 19.Be3 Rxb2**

Black wins back the pawn, but we still have an initiative.

**20.Na4**

Intending Nb6xd7, netting the bishop pair. With the queenside pawns having been traded off the bishop pair is not worth as much as before, but it is still a nice advantage to have.

### (442) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3**

I am offering this as an alternative to the 6.d3 Martinez Variation. The move 5.d3 can transpose to6.d3 lines, but more often Black tries to deviate. The main reason for playing 5.d3 is that we reduce the amount of theory, cutting out some very big openings. The most important one is the Open Spanish, but also the Arkhangelsk and the normal lines with ...Be7 plays out quite differently. The downside is that by committing our pawn to d3 before Black has played ...Be7, we give Black additional options with the bishop. One is to put it on c5, another to fianchetto it on g7. Generally speaking, I would say that the move order with 5.d3 is less ambitious, but also a lot less theory to learn, making it a very practical weapon. An advantage is that the structures arising are often quite similar to what we have seen before, which makes it an attractive alternative if you already studied the main lines as well.<skip/>

**5...d6 6.c3 Be7 7.O-O**

Has already transposed to the 6.d3 Spanish, but with Black being commited to ...d6 before ...b5.<skip/>

### (443) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1 O-O 9.h 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3**

**5...d6 6.c3 g6**

An interesting attempt. In the g6-lines of the normal Spanish we always wanted to play d4 in one move, which is no longer possible. Therefore we have to go for another slower setup.

**7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1**

Pay attention to this move order! We are trying to be as flexible as possible. Specifically we are not yet deciding if we want Be3, or the immediate Nbd2. It depends on which plan Black chooses. If Black is intending to push ...f5, then the bishop will be vulnerable on e3, meaning we should prefer the immediate Nbd2. If Black instead aims for central play with ...d5, then Be3 is a useful developing move fighting for the central squares.

**8...O-O 9.h3**

Continuing the waiting game. We still have no information from Black, so we keep both Nbd2 and Be3 options open.

**9...Re8**

Black removes the rook from the f-file, which clearly indicated that ...f5 is no longer on the agenda.

**10.Be3**

Therefore we are happy to play Be3.

**10...d5 11.Nbd2**

It looks like Black is happy having taken over the centre, but it's not that simple. In fact, it's hard for Black to find a decent follow-up here, as both ...dxe4 and ...d4 are unattractive.

**11...d4 12.cxd4 exd4 13.Bf4**

We have an open c-file, potential to capture on c6 and a strong bishop on f4. Meanwhile, Black's position is lacking harmony and there are no pawn breaks available.

### (444) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1 O-O 9.h 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3**

**5...d6 6.c3 g6**

**7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1**

**8...O-O 9.h3**

**9...Re8**

**10.Be3**

**10...d5 11.Nbd2**

**11...dxe4 12.dxe4**

Is a symmetrical position in which both our bishops are better than Black's. Next, we can either grab space with b4, or move the queen and bring a rook to the d-file. Meanwhile, it's very hard for Black to get counterplay, due to the stale structure.

### (445) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1 O-O 9.h 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3**

**5...d6 6.c3 g6**

**7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1**

**8...O-O 9.h3**

**9...Re8**

**10.Be3**

**10...d5 11.Nbd2**

**11...h6**

Is the best move, keeping flexible with the d-pawn.

**12.a3**

Transposes to themainline.

### (446) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1 O-O 9.h 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3**

**5...d6 6.c3 g6**

**7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1**

**8...O-O 9.h3**

**9...b5**

Has been the most popular move. Black develops the bishop to b7, but also creates a weakness on b5.

**10.Bc2**

As usual we retreat all the way to c2 once given a chance.

**10...Bb7 11.a4**

We have seen this idea several times in the positions with the bishop on e7. We are trying to force the b-pawn to b4, giving us a square on c4.

**11...b4 12.a5**

Prevents Black from connecting the pawns with ...a5.

**12...bxc3**

Has been the most popular choice, but looks like a concession.

**13.bxc3 Na7**

Black is trying to regroup creatively, but it does not make an impressive appearance.

**14.Na3 Nb5 15.Bd2**

Looks like a simple enough solution. Next we can either push d4 or continue to maneuver with Nc4. It Is again very hard for Black to generate counterplay.

### (447) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1 O-O 9.h 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3**

**5...d6 6.c3 g6**

**7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1**

**8...O-O 9.h3**

**9...b5**

**10.Bc2**

**10...Bb7 11.a4**

**11...b4 12.a5**

**12...Rb8 13.Be3**

Intending Nbd2 is comfortable.

### (448) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1 O-O 9.h 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3**

**5...d6 6.c3 g6**

**7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1**

**8...O-O 9.h3**

**9...b5**

**10.Bc2**

**10...Bb7 11.a4**

**11...b4 12.a5**

**12...d5 13.Nbd2**

Black is achieving very little with the ...d5-push, whereas we are getting a nice square on c5 and potential to attack both the d5- and e5-pawns. Next could be Bb3 followed by Qc2, activating the pieces and increasing pressure.

### (449) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1 O-O 9.h 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3**

**5...d6 6.c3 g6**

**7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1**

**8...O-O 9.h3**

**9...Bd7**

Another natural and popular developing move, but without a clear plan. With the bishop on d7 the push ...d5 makes less sense, but it is also harder to make ...f5 work as the f6-knight can't retreat to d7.

**10.Be3**

Makes sense, as ...f5 is not coming anytime soon.

**10...Nh5**

Is a more challenging but also riskier approach.

**11.d4 Qe8**

Beware of this! Black threatens a nasty tactic with Nxd4.

**12.Bb3**

Stepping out of Nxd4 and stopping ...f5 for a move longer.

**12...Kh8 13.Nbd2**

The thing to remember now is to take on e5 as soon as Black plays ...f5, so that the e3-bishop does not get trapped.

**13...f5 14.dxe5 f4 15.Bd4 dxe5 16.Bc5**

Is similar to the mainline.

### (450) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1 O-O 9.h 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3**

**5...d6 6.c3 g6**

**7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1**

**8...O-O 9.h3**

**9...Bd7**

**10.Be3**

**10...Nh5**

**11.d4 Qe8**

**12.Bb3**

**12...Kh8 13.Nbd2**

**13...Rd8 14.Qe2**

Just waiting for Black to commit to ...f5, meanwhile preparing to bring the rook to d1.

**14...f5**

The only reasonable plan at Black's disposal.

**15.dxe5 Nxe5 16.Nxe5 dxe5 17.Nf3**

Is pleasant. Black is not really building up any serious pressure on the kingside and the e-pawn could easily become vulnerable. Meanwhile, we have easy play with Rad1 and pressure on the d- and e-files.

### (451) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1 O-O 9.h 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3**

**5...d6 6.c3 g6**

**7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1**

**8...O-O 9.h3**

**9...Bd7**

**10.Be3**

**10...Nh5**

**11.d4 Qe8**

**12.Bb3**

**12...Kh8 13.Nbd2**

**13...Rd8 14.Qe2**

**14...f5**

**15.dxe5 f4 16.Bd4 dxe5 17.Bc5 Rf6 18.Rad1**

Simply very good for us, as there really isn't any scary counterplay on the kingside. Bd5 is a good next move, starting play against the e5-pawn.

### (452) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1 O-O 9.h 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3**

**5...d6 6.c3 g6**

**7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1**

**8...O-O 9.h3**

**9...Bd7**

**10.Be3**

**10...Re8**

10...h6 11.Nbd2 Re8 12.b4 transposes.

**11.Nbd2 h6 12.b4**

A logical move, grabbing space on the queenside. This was tried by the Chessable author Maaike Keetman!

**12...b5 13.Bb3 a5 14.a3**

This was Keetman's game, and I believe she was doing quite well, though things went downhill later in the game (Keetman, Maaike vs. Talsma, Paul A., lichess.org INT, 2020) . Next up are moves like Qc2 and Rab1 or Reb1, forcing a decision from Black on the queenside.

### (453) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1 O-O 9.h 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3**

**5...d6 6.c3 g6**

**7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1**

**8...O-O 9.h3**

**9...Bd7**

**10.Be3**

**10...Re8**

**11.Nbd2 h6 12.b4**

**12...d5 13.Rc1**

Is another of these small strengthening moves that we want to play. As Black still does not really want to act in the centre we are building slowly. Next up is a3, Qc2 and perhaps Bb3. As soon as Black tries something active, we are ready to meet it.

### (454) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1 O-O 9.h 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3**

**5...d6 6.c3 g6**

**7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1**

**8...O-O 9.h3**

**9...Nd7**

with this move Black clearly show their intention of pushing ...f5, therefore we should not play Be3.

**10.b4**

10.Nbd2 would be decent as well, but it makes a lot of sense to stop ...Nc5 and grap space on the queenside after ...Nd7.

**10...f5 11.Bb3+ Kh8 12.Ng5**

does not work for Black.

### (455) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1 O-O 9.h 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3**

**5...d6 6.c3 g6**

**7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1**

**8...O-O 9.h3**

**9...Nd7**

**10.b4**

**10...h6 11.Bb3**

A nice square for the bishop after b4.

**11...Kh7 12.a4 f5 13.Nbd2 Nf6 14.Ra2**

Is an idea we have already seen in the Deferred Steinitz Chapter. The rook steps out of the long diagonal and gets protected. Next we can follow up with either d4 or b5.

### (456) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1 O-O 9.h 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3**

**5...d6 6.c3 g6**

**7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1**

**8...O-O 9.h3**

**9...h6**

I believe this is Black's best move. Basically it continues the waiting game initiated by 9.h3, but is also a useful move in itself.

**10.a3**

Very fancy, counterwaiting! a3 is useful for two reasons: it prepares to play b4, but also after a later d4 exd4 cxd4 the move ...Nb4 is prevented. If 10.Be3 Black would have played 10...Nd7 , intending ...f5.10.Nbd2 Re8 11.Nf1 is possible, but then Black pushes 11...b5 12.Bc2 a5 and I am not sure the knight is so great on f1.

**10...Nd7**

This would be an improved version of 9...Nd7 for Black, but I still believe we have good chances.

**11.b4 f5 12.Bb3+ Kh7 13.Nbd2 Nf6 14.a4**

Accepting the fact that we are a tempo down compared to 9...Nd7.14.Ra2 is still possible, but the pawn belong to a4 as we need to be able to push b5.<level start="9...Nd7"/>

**14...g5 15.exf5**

Is a good reaction now that Black can't recapture with the pawn on f5.

**15...Bxf5 16.Ne4**

Looks nice for us. ...g5 isn't anywhere near as scary with the f5-pawn traded off. Next we can even play Nh2, preventing ...g4, after which it's quite hard for Black to create further threats.

### (457) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1 O-O 9.h 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3**

**5...d6 6.c3 g6**

**7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1**

**8...O-O 9.h3**

**9...h6**

**10.a3**

**10...Nd7**

**11.b4 f5 12.Bb3+ Kh7 13.Nbd2 Nf6 14.a4**

**14...f4**

This would be the King's Indian style of playing. Black intends to push the pawns on the kingside. The main reason we are not worried is that the centre is not yet closed. In a King's Indian, the white d-pawn would already be on d5, but here we can open up the centre with d4 and dxe5.

**15.Ba3**

Preparing b5, as the a1-rook is no longer hanging. Additionally, the bishop on a3 puts pressure both on d6, but also later against the rook on f8.

**15...g5**

Continuing the plan.

**16.b5 Na5**

This leaves the knight unable to join the kingside action ever.

**17.Ba2**

We push d4 and open up the centre long before Black's threats on the kingside are getting serious.

### (458) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1 O-O 9.h

**9...h6**

**10.a3**

**10...Nd7**

**11.b4 f5 12.Bb3+ Kh7 13.Nbd2 Nf6 14.a4**

**14...f4**

**15.Ba3**

**15...g5**

**16.b5 Ne7**

The logical move, intending to put the knight on g6.

**17.d4**

Black is not in time to defend the e5-pawn in a good way.

**17...Ng6**

would be the logical move, but it fails to

**18.dxe5**

and the f8-rook is hanging if Black recaptures.

### (459) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1 O-O 9.h 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3**

**9...h6**

**10.a3**

**11.b4 f5 12.Bb3+ Kh7 13.Nbd2 Nf6 14.a4**

**14...fxe4 15.Nxe4 Nxe4 16.dxe4**

Is solid. Black has a semi-open f-file, but we will protect the f3-knight by Re3 after which it is very hard for Black to create any further play. Meanwhile, on the queenside we have all the trumps and will push our pawns creating an initiative.

### (460) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1 O-O 9.h 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3**

**7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1**

**8...O-O 9.h3**

**9...h6**

**10.a3**

**10...b5**

A natural move, as our a4-reaction will lose a tempo later on. 10...Re8 11.Be3 d5 12.Nbd2 b5 13.Bc2 a5 leads to the same line.

**11.Bc2 d5 12.Be3 dxe4 13.dxe4 Qxd1 14.Rxd1**

Is not at all a drawish ending. We have a beautiful square on c5 for a knight, and the b5-pawn is vulnerable. Meanwhile, Black have very little to activity of their own.

### (461) 22. Alternative: Anderssen Va,5...d6 - 6...g6 7.O-O Bg7 8.Re1 O-O 9.h

**9...h6**

**10.a3**

**10...b5**

**11.Bc2 Bb7**

Would be an attempt to play a Zaitsev/ Breyer style position.

**12.Nbd2**

Next up we can play b4 and if the c6-knight reroutes to d7, then Nb3-a5 becomes a strong possibility.

**12...Re8 13.b4**

Intending a4, putting pressure on Black's queenside.

**13...a5 14.Rb1 axb4 15.axb4**

Looks fairly comfortable for us. Black's bishop is a bit strangely placed on b7, and we will be able to gain space with d4 soon.

Gaining space.

**12.Be3 a4**

Does fix our queenside structure, but makes the a4-pawn vulnerable.

**13.Nbd2 Re8**

would allow

**14.c4**

and the a4-pawn drops.

Looks a bit better for us. Next, we can go Rc1 and prepare the c4-push, which would weaken the a4-pawn. Meanwhile, our centre is very solidly protected.

**11.Bc2 a5**

**12.Be3 d5**

12...Re8 13.Nbd2 d5 14.Qc1 is an alternate move order.

**13.Nbd2 Re8**

Natural play from Black, gaining space and centralizing the pieces.

**14.Qc1**

An cunning move, hitting h6 and potentially creating threats on the c-file. 14.b4 is another natural move, but Black is in time for 14...Be6 15.Nb3 Nd7 , covering both the d5-pawn and the c5-square. Still, that would also be a very playable position for White.

**14...Be6 15.a4 b4 16.Nb3**

Gaining a tempo on the h6-pawn.

**16...Kh7 17.Nc5**

Before Black had time to stop it with ...Nd7. Now we gain a tempo on the e6-bishop and have a slight edge.

The best move, prophylactically protecting h6!

**15.d4**

The most concrete move, opening up in the centre.

**15...exd4 16.cxd4 dxe4 17.Nxe4 Nxe4 18.Bxe4**

This is very good for us, as the c6-knight is hanging.

**18...Rxe4 19.Qxc6**

Wins the b5-pawn.

**15.d4**

**15...dxe4 16.Nxe4 Bf5 17.Ng3**

Keeping more pieces on the board.

**17...Bxc2 18.Qxc2**

The position has slowed down a bit. Black has managed to trade a passive bishop for our slightly more active one, but we have gained some space in the centre. Next up we will play Rad1. An interesting long-term plan would be to play h4-h5, creating some tension towards Black's king.

### (468) 23. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...b5 - 6...Be7 transposition #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 b5 6.Bb3 Be7 7.a4**

Gives Black fewer options than in the regular 6.d3 b5 Spanish. Without d6 Black is not in time to protect b5 by ...Bd7.<skip/>

**7...Bb7 8.O-O**

Now@this transposes tochapter 13 via 8...O-O 9.Nc3 and tochapter 14 via 8...d6 9.Nc3 .

### (469) 23. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...b5 - 6...Be7 transposition #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 b5 6.Bb3 Be7 7.a4**

**7...b4 8.O-O**

Now ...O-O transposes to the 6.d3 b5Martinez Variation.<skip/>

### (470) 23. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...b5 - 6...Bc5 7.Bg5 h6 8.Bh4 d6 tran 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 b5 6.Bb3 Bc5**

This is considered to be one of the main downsides of 5.d3 instead of 6.d3. Normally against the Arkhangelsk we want to push c3 and d4, but here that is no longer a tempting option, as it would lose a very important tempo. The fact that Jan Gustafsson recommends this in his Lifetime Repertoire on 1.e4 e5 is a testimony to how solid it is.<skip/>

**7.Bg5**

An interesting concept. We want to play c3 and reach our desired structure, but start with Bg5 in order to stop ...d5. In recent year the mainline has instead been 7.Nc3 intending a quick Nd5, but Black has solved their issues there and although it can definitely be tried, I find the systems with c3 a little bit trickier for Black to handle.

**7...h6 8.Bh4 d6 9.c3**

Transposes.

### (471) 23. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...b5 - 6...Bc5 7.Bg5 h6 8.Bh4 Be7 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 b5 6.Bb3 Bc5**

**7.Bg5**

**7...h6 8.Bh4 Be7**

Was the choice of Mamedyarov when he faced Aronian in the recent New in Chess Classics. It might look strange to lose a tempo, but it is a very typical idea known from for instance the Italian. The point is that the trade of dark-squared bishops eases up Black's defense so much, that it is worth losing a tempo on it.

**9.a4 b4**

would normally be quite solid, but here we have an interesting and somewhat atypical possibility.

**10.Bxf6 Bxf6 11.Bd5**

The knight will be strong on c4 and Black will have to trade the light-squared bishops later on.

### (472) 23. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...b5 - 6...Bc5 7.Bg5 h6 8.Bh4 Be7 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 b5 6.Bb3 Bc5**

**7.Bg5**

**7...h6 8.Bh4 Be7**

**9.a4 Rb8 10.axb5**

Aronian continued calmer with Nbd2, but I quite like this more direct approach.

**10...axb5 11.Nc3**

Making use of the fact that we have not yet played c3.11.Bg3 d6 12.h3!? is another interesting try, saving the dark-squared bishop.

**11...d6 12.Bxf6**

Giving up the bishop pair in order to establish a strong knight on d5.

**12...Bxf6 13.Nd5 O-O 14.O-O**

I believe we are doing quite well here. The position is quite similar to many of the 6.d3 b5 lines, where we also give up the bishop pair to gain more control over the light squares. Next, we can follow up with c3, h3, Qe2 and then long-term either push d4 or enter on the a-file, depending on what Black does.<skip/>

### (473) 23. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...b5 - 6...Bc5 7.Bg5 Be7 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 b5 6.Bb3 Bc5**

**7.Bg5**

**7...Be7 8.a4 Rb8 9.axb5 axb5 10.Nc3**

is similar to 7...h6, but likely to gain us a tempo, as we can take on f6 in one move.

### (474) 23. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...b5 - 6...Bc5 7.Bg5 d6 8.c3 h6 9.Bh4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 b5 6.Bb3 Bc5**

**7.Bg5**

**7...d6**

By far the main move.

**8.c3**

8.Nc3 is not as strong here, as the bishop on c5 is much more active than on e7.

**8...h6**

Overwhelmingly most popular. In such positions, it is almost universally a good idea for Black to include h6 Bh4, as it gives the option of ...g5 later on.

**9.Bh4**

It might look calm with us having played d3 and c3, but in fact the position is quite sharp. We are trying to prove that the h4-d8 pin is annoying for Black, and if they play ...g5 that the king is weak. Meanwhile, we are likely castling and trying to find a good moment to push d4.

**9...g5**

This is the most direct move, immediately settling the question 'g5 or not'

**10.Bg3 O-O**

If you see O-O in this structure, for the first time you might think it looks scary for Black, but in fact it's a very common thing to do also after g5. The kingside is so limited and the g3-bishop actually more in the way than contributing to White's play, so it is relatively safe to castle short. Still, it does give us a target and even if we aren't close to mating now, there is always some potential in the future.

**11.Nbd2 Be6**

is a misunderstanding. Our bishop is looking active, but Black needs their light-squared bishop to cover the weaknesses on the kingside.

**12.h4 g4 13.Nh2**

Now the g4-pawn is hanging, forcing Black to make another weakening move.

**13...h5 14.O-O**

Followed by Kh1 and f3 gives us a promising initiative. Immediate 14.f3 is also promising.

### (475) 23. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...b5 - 6...Bc5 7.Bg5 d6 8.c3 h6 9.Bh4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 b5 6.Bb3 Bc5**

**7...d6**

**8.c3**

**8...h6**

**9.Bh4**

**9...g5**

**10.Bg3 O-O**

**11.Nbd2 Bb6**

This prophylactic move is needed for Black at some point, as otherwise the maneuver Nc6-e7-g6 runs into d4.

**12.a4**

An important part of our strategy. Our overarching idea is to execute a well-timed d4 push later on, but by playing a4 first we are forcing Black to make some unpleasant choices. The move ...b4 would weaken the c4-square, but staying put with ...Rb8 gives us a choice between winning the a-file or pushing a5 ourselves at an appropriate moment.

**12...b4 13.O-O**

Black's best move is 13...Rb8 , transposing to the12...Rb8 mainline.

### (476) 23. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...b5 - 6...Bc5 7.Bg5 d6 8.c3 h6 9.Bh4

**9.Bh4**

**9...g5**

**10.Bg3 O-O**

**11.Nbd2 Bb6**

**12.a4**

**12...Rb8 13.O-O**

It might look strange to castle into the 'attack' of the h- and g-pawns, and in some sense it is true. The reason we do it is twofold: the kingside is too small an area for us to make great progress anyway, and castling helps us prepare d4, for instance by allowing Re1.

**13...Nh5 14.Nxe5**

does not work for Black.

### (477) 23. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...b5 - 6...Bc5 7.Bg5 d6 8.c3 h6 9.Bh4

**10.Bg3 O-O**

**11.Nbd2 Bb6**

**12.a4**

**12...Rb8 13.O-O**

**13...Na5**

A typical reaction from Black, preparing ...Nh5.13...b4 14.h3 would transpose to the mainline.

**14.Ba2**

An additional benefit of the move a4 - we keep our bishop on the most active diagonal!

**14...Nh5 15.d4**

The most aggressive, and also most logical choice. We hit in the centre immediately after Black has left with the knights. 15.Kh1 is another tempting move, but I think it gives Black fewer practical problems.

**15...Nxg3 16.fxg3**

Pay attention to this recapture! In this structure, with Black having already played h6 and g5, taking with the f-pawn is usually a good idea. It opens up the f-file, creating pressure on f7, but also makes our own king much safer once tucked away on h1.

**13...Na5**

**14...Nh5 15.d4**

**15...g4 16.Bh4**

The most promising way to sacrifice a pawn, although 16.Nh4 exd4 17.Kh1!? also looks quite scary for Black.

**16...Qe8 17.Ne1 exd4**

leads to a similar style of play as 16...Qd7 .

**18.Kh1**

We play f3 and open up towards the black king.

### (479) 23. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...b5 - 6...Bc5 7.Bg5 d6 8.c3 h6 9.Bh4

**14...Nh5 15.d4**

**15...g4 16.Bh4**

**16...Qd7**

This was played in Rodriguez Fraga - Zhekov, correspondence 2019, but I think only in correspondence chess one would be willing to enter such a position with Black.

**17.Ne1 exd4**

At least Black gets a pawn for their suffering.

**18.Kh1**

An important move. We remove the king from the pin, so that we can play f3 or even f4 later. I believe a quick glance at the position is enough to show just how dangerous it is for Black, with all their pieces scattered around the board. We are not in a big rush to deliver mate, but will have an ongoing initiative for a long time.

### (480) 23. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...b5 - 6...Bc5 7.Bg5 d6 8.c3 h6 9.Bh4

**7.Bg5**

**7...d6**

**8.c3**

**8...h6**

**9.Bh4**

**9...Bb6**

The most common move, and the recommendation of Jan Gustafsson in his LTR. Black prophylactically retreats the bishop to b6, to dissuade us from pushing d4 which makes it much easier for Black to execute the maneuver Nc6-e7-g6.

**10.a4**

As explained previously, playing a4 is generally useful for us here. Timing-wise it makes a lot of sense to do it after Black has played ...Bb6, as the b-file is then blocked.

**10...Rb8 11.axb5 axb5 12.Na3**

is an illustration of why a4 is well-timed after ...Bb6.

**12...Ba7**

would be a try to keep the pawn on b5, but despite losing a tempo it also fails to the cute tactic

**13.Nxb5 Rxb5 14.Ba4**

winning a pawn for White.

### (481) 23. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...b5 - 6...Bc5 7.Bg5 d6 8.c3 h6 9.Bh4

**7...d6**

**8.c3**

**8...h6**

**9.Bh4**

**9...Bb6**

**10.a4**

**10...g5**

The best move, and the recommendation of Sethuraman in his LTR.

**11.Bg3 Rb8 12.axb5 axb5 13.Na3**

is similar to the previous move. Black struggles to defend b5, and

**13...b4 14.Nc4**

is good for us as we get the b6-bishop.

### (482) 23. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...b5 - 6...Bc5 7.Bg5 d6 8.c3 h6 9.Bh4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 b5 6.Bb3 Bc5**

**8.c3**

**8...h6**

**9.Bh4**

**9...Bb6**

**10.a4**

**10...g5**

**11.Bg3 Bd7**

This is very rare, but quite interesting. Black does not make commitments on the queenside, keeping the most flexible structure. The downside is that Bd7 is not particularly useful at supporting counterplay, as the bishop would often rather go to g4 later on.

**12.O-O O-O 13.Nbd2**

13.Na3 Ne7! leads nowhere for White.

**13...Ne7 14.d4**

is good for us, as Black can't hold on to the e5-pawn.

### (483) 23. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...b5 - 6...Bc5 7.Bg5 d6 8.c3 h6 9.Bh4

**10.a4**

**10...g5**

**11.Bg3 Bd7**

**12.O-O O-O 13.Nbd2**

**13...Nh7**

A typical regrouping to get counterplay. Black prepares ...Qf6 and ...h5-h4.

**14.h3 h5 15.axb5**

forces the queen away from the kingside.

**15...axb5 16.Rxa8 Qxa8 17.d4 h4 18.Bh2 exd4 19.e5**

opens up the centre before Black has time to coordinate. With Ne4 coming next we have a very dangerous initiative.

### (484) 23. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...b5 - 6...Bc5 7.Bg5 d6 8.c3 h6 9.Bh4

**11.Bg3 Bd7**

**12.O-O O-O 13.Nbd2**

**13...Nh7**

**14.h3 Qf6 15.Bd5**

Quite a rare idea for these positions, but looks promising. Another, more typical reaction would be 15.d4!? exd4 16.cxd4 Bxd4 17.Nxd4 Nxd4 18.Bd5 , followed by Re1 and Rc1 with typical compensation for the pawn in the form of the bishop pair and the weakened Black king. Looks interesting for White, although objectively Black should be OK there.

**15...Rae8 16.axb5 axb5 17.Bxc6**

A very strange-looking move, but with a clear plan.

**17...Bxc6 18.b4**

This is it! We intend to play Qc2 followed by c4-c5, simply trapping the b6-bishop. Surprisingly, it looks very hard for Black to stop it!

### (485) 23. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...b5 - 6...Bc5 7.Bg5 d6 8.c3 h6 9.Bh4

**8.c3**

**8...h6**

**9.Bh4**

**9...Bb6**

**10.a4**

**10...g5**

**11.Bg3 b4**

Black's most usual response. The queenside is kept close, but we get a nice square on c4 for our knight.

**12.Nbd2 O-O 13.O-O**

Black should play ...Rb8, transposing.

**13...Kg7 14.Nc4**

is good for us as

**14...Na5 15.Nxb6**

forces Black to recapture away from the centre.

### (486) 23. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...b5 - 6...Bc5 7.Bg5 d6 8.c3 h6 9.Bh4

**8...h6**

**9.Bh4**

**9...Bb6**

**10.a4**

**10...g5**

**11.Bg3 b4**

**12.Nbd2 Rb8**

Again a very useful move that Black will struggle without. Black is keeping everything protected and flexible, and awaits how we are going to fight for the initiative. An additional and quite important point is that Nc4 can now be met by ...Na5, when the b6-bishop is defended.

**13.O-O O-O**

The position is very complex and strategically sharp. Our main idea still consists of pushing d4, but it does require some preparation and finesse to get it to work. If we are not able, then we are running the risk of our g3-bishop being out of the game, only attacking a solidly defended e5-pawn. But for Black things are also not so easy. The most natural way to play would be ...Ne7-g6, and ...Nh7 both intending to push the h- and g-pawns. However, both these moves move away from the centre and makes it much more likely for us to be able to push d4.

**14.h3**

A patient move. Black did not intend to play ...g4 immediately, but if we are to push d4 later then ...g4 is an annoying reply. It also asks Black to make a move, which isn't the easiest thing to do either! The immediate 14.Rc1 is also an interesting option in the same spirit.

**14...Ba7**

Continuing the waiting tactics. ...Ba7 is useful in that it opens up the b-file, making ...Na5 an option on the next move, as b4 is protected.

**15.Rc1**

A useful move, and prophylaxis against 15...Na5. The immediate 15.d4 is interesting, as Black loses a tempo with the bishop after 15...bxc3 16.bxc3 exd4 17.cxd4 Nxd4 18.Nxd4 Bxd4 , but although we have compensation after 19.Rb1 followed by Nf3, I don't really believe we are pushing for an edge.

**15...Na5**

We are well positioned to handle this now.

**16.Ba2 b3 17.Bb1**

And here it is VERY important that the rook is not blocked in on a1, but active on c1!

This is very slow. Likewise, 15...Ne7 would allow 16.d4 with a great position too.

**16.d4**

**16...exd4 17.e5**

gives as a huge initiative, not the least because Black's king has stepped into the e5-g7 pin.

**15...g4**

An interesting idea that we will also see in the mainline.

**16.hxg4 Bxg4 17.Bh4**

is an annoying pin. The position looks quite scary for Black, and I am not sure the counterplay will come fast enough.

**17...bxc3 18.bxc3 Kg7**

Protecting f6, thereby preparing the maneuver ...Ne7-g6 to get rid of the pin.

**19.d4**

A logical moment for this, as Black is not yet coordinated. We are enjoying a nice initiative, and taking the pawn does not work out at all for Black:

**19...exd4 20.e5 Nxe5 21.Ne4 Ned7 22.cxd4**

Gives us an overwhelming initiative for the pawn. The h4-d8 pin is an eternal issue for Black and we have plenty of time to increase pressure step by step. Moves like Qd3 followed by Ng3-f5 will likely be too much for Black to handle.

**12.Nbd2 Rb8**

**13.O-O O-O**

**14.h3**

**14...Kg7**

Sethuraman's suggestion. Black continues the trench war, waiting for us to do something. h8 might look like a more natural square for the king, keeping the g-file open, but the problem then is that the f7-pawn will not be protected.

**15.Bc4**

Another 'small' move, but this one is a little more difficult to understand at first glance. There are two reasons the bishop is useful on c4: one is that the a6-pawn is under attack, which makes it more difficult to play ...g4 hxg4 Bxg4. The other is that once we manage to play d4 later on, the bishop can come back to e2, helping us with the defense of our king.

**15...Rg8**

This is a more direct move. Black prepares to play g4 after which the rook will be attacking along the g-file.

**16.d4**

Time for action! When we open up the centre the rook is doing nothing on g8, and ...Re8 would lose a tempo.

**16...bxc3 17.bxc3 exd4 18.e5**

Opening up even further.

**18...dxe5 19.Nxe5 Nxe5 20.Bxe5 dxc3 21.Ne4**

wins immediately.

Keeping the bishop on the good diagonal.

**21...dxc3 22.Qxd8 Rxd8 23.Bxc3**

We are keeping our initiative well into the ending. Ne5-c6 will be an unpleasant follow-up and the c3-g7 pin is very hard for Black to get out of. This is the sort of line that is likely to happen once we manage to time the d4-push well.

Continuing to wait...

**16.Re1**

Overprotecting e4, and preparing Nf1-e3, but mainly continuing the waiting game. 16.Rc1 was also interesting, but 16...Na5 is an annoying reply.

**16...Na5**

can be met by

**17.d4**

which is one of the key points of 16.Re1 rather than 16.Rc1.

Initiating more concrete play. If Black would do nothing, then either Rc1 or Nf1-e3 next would continue to improve our position.

**17.hxg4 Bxg4 18.Bxa6**

still wins a pawn.

**15...Ba7**

**16.Re1**

**16...g4**

**17.hxg4 Nxg4**

Black's point is that Re1 has weakened the f2-pawn. On the other hand, ...g4 is a very commital decision, giving Black a worse structure and us a nice square on h4 for the knight or the bishop. However, the position is still quite sharp.

**18.Qe2**

I like this move, overprotecting the f2-pawn and preparing Nh4. The immediate 18.Nh4 runs into 18...Nxf2! 19.Bxf2 Bxf2+ 20.Kxf2 Qxh4 .

**18...Ne7 19.Nh4**

Would leave us in full control over the kingside.

**18.Qe2**

**18...Rg8**

The best move, preparing a square for the king on f8 and hoping to get counterplay on the g-file.

**19.Bd5**

Forcing the knight away.

**19...Ne7 20.d4**

The position is quite messy. We have managed to push d4 finally and are not really in any danger of getting mated, but Black still has some counterplay on the kingside. Next up we can play Nf1-e3, but it also depends a lot on what Black is doing. For instance

**20...Nxd5 21.exd5 f6 22.c4**

followed by Rac1 and c5, gives us some initiative in the centre. Strategically complicated, dynamic, double-edged and fun!

### (497) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...O-O 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 Bc5**

Another of the supposed downsides of the 5.d3 move order, but quite different from 5...b5 6.Bb3 Bc5. By not committing to ...b5 Black does not give us a target for attack, but on the other hand, we are now in time to play c3 and then retreat our bishop to c2 in one go. In fact, the position is very likely to become an Anti-Berlin. It is not exactly the same version as the ones I am offering as ...a6 Ba4 is included, but it still means that if Black plays it, they are less likely to be into the details. After all, if you are a Berlin player, you would normally play 3...Nf6...

**6.c3**

Not giving Black a second chance to force our bishop to b3.

**6...O-O 7.O-O Re8 8.Bg5**

This is the 4...Bc5 Anti-Berlin.

### (498) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3 b5 9.Bc2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 Bc5**

**6.c3**

**6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3**

Now@we have reached a position much more frequently seen after 3...Nf6 4.d3 Bc5 5.c3 O-O 6.O-O d6 7.h3 a6 8.Ba4 . In the Berlin, I advocated the move orderwith 7.Re1 instead of 7.h3, but as explained there it was due to Black playing a quick ...Ne7 intending c6 and d5. With a6 already on the board such a plan is less strong, as Black won't get a tempo on our bishop. On the other hand, in our Berlin repertoire after 7.Re1 a6 I advocate 8.Bxc6 , which is no longer possible here. Those two things combined explain why I am here giving 8.h3 rather than 8.Re1. Yes, all these move orders are a bit tricky to keep track of, I know, but I also promise you it will increase your understanding of the positions and of chess in general!<skip start="8.Re1"/>

**8...b5 9.Bc2 h6 10.Re1**

This position is covered in our Berlin chapter after 7.Re1 h6 8.h3 a6 9.Ba4 b5 10.Bc2.<skip/>

### (499) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3 b5 9.Bc2

**6.c3**

**6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3**

**8...b5 9.Bc2 Bb6**

This is Fressinet's second recommendation in his Chess24 Repertoire on the Berlin. Black is trying to save on the move ...h6.

**10.a4**

The typical response.

**10...b4 11.Bg5**

This is important. If we do not play Bg5, then Black simply has a better version compared to the lines with ...h6.

**11...h6 12.Bh4**

The pin is quite annoying for Black. As we have seen many times in the Arkhangelsk chapters, the lack of a bishop on e7 means that the kingside could become pretty vulnerable. The play now resembles the 5.d3 b5 chapter quite a bit. We are committed to castling, but on the other hand our bishop went to c2 in one go.

**12...Rb8 13.Nbd2 Be6**

is a try to play without ...g5.

**14.Rc1**

Would be a useful move in general, overprotecting the c3-pawn, so that 14...bxc3 15.bxc3 Ba5 always can be met by 16.Bb1 . Next up we can continue building with Re1.

### (500) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3 b5 9.Bc2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 Bc5**

**8...b5 9.Bc2 Bb6**

**10.a4**

**10...b4 11.Bg5**

**11...h6 12.Bh4**

**12...g5**

Probably has to be played sooner or later, as the pin is eternally annoying otherwise.

**13.Bg3**

Play is similar to the 5...b5 lines, and our version is certainly not worse, as the bishop is well placed on c2.

### (501) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3 b5 9.Bc2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 Bc5**

**6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3**

**8...b5 9.Bc2 Bb6**

**10.a4**

**10...Rb8 11.Na3**

is as usual a good once Black has committed to ...Bb6.

**11...b4 12.Nc4 Ba7 13.Bg5**

is a very nice version of these positions for White.

### (502) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3 b5 9.Bc2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 Bc5**

**6.c3**

**6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3**

**8...b5 9.Bc2 Bb6**

**10.a4**

**10...Bd7**

The most challenging move. Black is not committing the pawn to b4.

**11.Bg5**

Setting up a positional threat.

**11...h6**

Allowing us to execute our threat:

**12.axb5 axb5 13.Rxa8 Qxa8 14.Bxf6 gxf6 15.Nbd2**

Leaves Black with a broken kingside.

### (503) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3 b5 9.Bc2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 Bc5**

**6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3**

**8...b5 9.Bc2 Bb6**

**10.a4**

**10...Bd7**

**11.Bg5**

**11...Rb8 12.d4**

A good moment to expand in the centre. We are toying with the idea of d5, after which ...Ne7 would allow us to take on f6.

**12...h6**

Almost universally a good reaction to Bg5.

**13.Bh4 exd4**

would also stop our d5-idea, but it is always risky to give up the centre.

**14.cxd4 g5 15.axb5 axb5 16.Qd2**

A typical idea, sacrificing the h4-bishop for a very strong attack. Again, the reason all these lines are so scary for Black is because so many of the pieces are stuck over on the queenside.

**16...gxh4**

The only critical move. We were threatening to take on g5.

**17.Qxh6 Nh7**

Absolutely the only way to defend. Black needs to push the f-pawn in order to get more pieces into the defense.

**18.e5**

Threatening mate in one!

**18...f5 19.exf6 Rf7**

Again the only move that isn't an immediate mate. I have not been able to find a clear win here, but the position is unbelievably scary for Black and I wouldn't expect anyone to be able to defend in a practical game here. I'll give a few illustrative lines of how the game might develop:

**20.Nc3**

Adding more fuel to the fire!

**20...Qxf6 21.Bxh7+**

is a useful tactic

is very good now that Black can't take on f6 with the queen.

**17.Qxh6 Nh7**

**18.e5**

**18...f5 19.exf6 Rf7**

**20.Nc3**

**20...Nxd4**

Again the only move!

**21.Ng5 Nxf6 22.Nce4**

Is simply too much for Black to handle, for instance

**22...Nxe4 23.Bxe4**

threatening both Bh7+ and Bd5+.

**18.e5**

**18...f5 19.exf6 Rf7**

**20.Nc3**

**20...Nxd4**

**21.Ng5 Nxg5**

Trying at least to trade a few pieces

**22.Qxg5+ Kf8 23.Qh6+ Kg8 24.Rae1**

Adding another piece into the attack is more important than our c2-bishop.

**24...Nxc2 25.Qg6+ Kf8 26.Nd5**

The f1-rook is passive, so we are not really losing any value by letting Black capture on e1!

**26...Nxe1 27.Rxe1**

A telling picture. Despite being a rook and a piece down Black has to play incredibly well not to lose instantly.

**27...Bc6 28.Ne7 Rxe7 29.Qh6+**

Improving our queen slightly.

**29...Kg8 30.Qg5+ Kh7 31.Rxe7+ Qxe7 32.fxe7**

To be honest, I believe Black has decent chances to make a draw in this ending, although it won't be easy. To reach it in a practical game, though? Very, very unlikely, even for a world-class player.

### (507) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3 b5 9.Bc2

**10.a4**

**10...Bd7**

**11.Bg5**

**11...Rb8 12.d4**

**12...h6**

**13.Bh4 g5**

Looks scary, but it's very hard for Black to do without this move in the long run.

**14.Nxg5**

Very tempting. 14.Bg3 is another interesting position that is certainly playable, but Nxg5 puts maximum pressure on Black!

**14...hxg5 15.Bxg5 exd4**

is suicide, as it opens up too many diagonals and squares for us.

**16.e5**

clears the c2-h7 diagonal and the e4-square.

**16...Nxe5 17.cxd4 Ng6 18.Ra3**

Is another very nice and thematic idea. Again Black will be unable to hold onto the f6-knight.

### (508) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3 b5 9.Bc2

**14.Nxg5**

**14...hxg5 15.Bxg5 exd4**

**16.e5**

**16...dxe5 17.Nd2**

Black will be unable to defend the f6-knight, for instance

**17...Bc5 18.Ne4 Be7 19.Bxf6 Bxf6 20.Qh5**

Threatening mate with Nxf6 followed by Qh7.

**20...Re8 21.f4**

Another very nice move, activating the rook. There are simply too many attackers in relation to defends, so Black is just lost.

### (509) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3 b5 9.Bc2

**13.Bh4 g5**

**14.Nxg5**

**14...hxg5 15.Bxg5 Kg7**

Necessary, to activate the rook via h8.

**16.axb5**

Opening up the a-file for our rook before we continue on the kingside

**16...axb5 17.f4**

Threatening to win immediately if the f-file gets open.

**17...exd4 18.Kh1**

Unfortunately necessary, as the discovered attack by d3+ was too big a threat. Now we are still threatening e5+ and it is very dangerous for Black.

**18...Rh8 19.e5 dxe5 20.fxe5 Nxe5 21.Bxf6+ Qxf6 22.Rxf6 Kxf6 23.cxd4**

gives us a winning material advantage.

**16...axb5 17.f4**

**17...exd4 18.Kh1**

**18...Bxh3**

An amazing shot, and the only move to stay in the game. It turns out that not only Black's, but also our king is in danger.

**19.e5**

19.gxh3 Qd7 20.Kh2 Rh8 21.Qf3 Nh5 gives Black enough counterplay.

**19...dxe5 20.fxe5 Bxg2+**

Is another tactical liquidation attempt.

**21.Kxg2 Qd5+ 22.Qf3 Qxf3+ 23.Rxf3 Ne8 24.Bf6+ Nxf6 25.exf6+ Kh6 26.Rh3+ Kg5 27.Nd2**

The attack continues into the ending! The limited material gives Black decent hopes for a draw, but some very good defensive moves will still have to be performed.

is just a winning material advantage for us.

**18...Bxh3**

**19.e5**

**19...dxe5 20.fxe5 Nxe5 21.Bxf6+ Qxf6 22.Rxf6 Be6**

Amazingly, Black manages to stay in the game. Due to the counterthreat of Rh8+ Kg1 d3+, we have to give back a rook.

**23.Ra6**

Simply intending to eliminate the dangerous b6-bishop, after which the attack ends.

**23...d3 24.Rxb6 Rxb6 25.Rf4 dxc2 26.Qxc2**

All the crazy complications has ended, and we are left with a queen for rook and bishop. Normally that's a major material advantage, but here Black is well coordinated and is a favorite to create a fortress. Still, White keeps some chances, but more importantly, the level of accuracy demanded from Black to get here is overwhelmingly high. If you think it was too chaotic, then 14.Bg3 is of course playable as well, and leads to less tactical but perhaps not less interesting fight.

### (513) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3 Ba7 9.Re 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 Bc5**

**6.c3**

**6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3**

**8...Ba7**

The main move, and what has been the most popular in practical play. Black plays as in the Italian, and preemptively withdraws the bishop.

**9.Re1**

Our idea is fairly simple here - we intend to play Nbd2-f1-g3 and push d4, after which the central space will give us a slight advantage.

**9...h6 10.Nbd2**

This position could also be reached via the Berlin, with 7.Re1 h6 8.h3 a6 9.Ba4 Ba7 10.Nbd2.<skip/>

**10...Re8 11.Nf1 b5**

is one of many ways for Black to play, but a rather concrete one.

**12.Bc2 d5**

As usual, the main move to consider once retreating all the way to c2.

**13.exd5 Nxd5 14.Ng3**

is similar, but here Black lacks another defender of the king.

### (514) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3 Ba7 9.Re 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 Bc5**

**8...Ba7**

**9.Re1**

**9...h6 10.Nbd2**

**10...Re8 11.Nf1 b5**

**12.Bc2 d5**

**13.exd5 Qxd5**

The typical recapture.

**14.Ng3**

This sort of position frequently occurs in the Italian, but there Black hasn't normally committed to ...b5. As Black is not really attacking anything on the queenside, the move ...b5 is more of a weakening than a strength.

**14...Be6 15.Bd2**

is one of many interesting ways to play. We intend to play Qc1, after which a sacrifice on h6 is always in the air. It's certainly playable for Black, but I believe we still keep a little pressure. Another idea is to play a4, massaging the weakness on b5 and perhaps gaining the a-file.

### (515) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3 Ba7 9.Re 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 Bc5**

**6.c3**

**6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3**

**8...Ba7**

**9.Re1**

**9...Nh5**

A rare but very interesting move. Black intends ...Qf6 and to plant the knight on f4.

**10.d4 Qf6 11.Nbd2**

11.Na3 is a safer way of playing. The point is 11...Nf4 12.Bxc6! bxc6 13.Nc4 , and due to the pressure on the e5-pawn Black has to retreat with 13...Ng6 , which relieves a lot of the pressure. Still, if possible, we would of course like to keep our precious light-squared bishop!

**11...exd4**

Gives up the centre too early, which is very dangerous in combination with moves like ...Nh5.11...Nf4 12.Nf1 is a worse version for Black, as we keep the option of trading on c6 whenever we want.

**12.Bxc6 dxc3 13.e5 dxe5 14.Ne4 Qxc6 15.Nxe5 cxb2 16.Bxb2**

gives Black two extra pawns, but our initiative is super strong!

**16...Qh6 17.Ba3**

would for instance already pick up an exchange, as

**17...Re8 18.Bc1**

surprisingly wins immediately! The point is that after

**18...Qe6 19.Qxh5 Qxe5 20.Nf6+**

wins, as the e8-rook is hanging. Cunning, and not easy, but very logical as Black lacks developing the c8-bishop!

### (516) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3 Ba7 9.Re 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 Bc5**

**8...Ba7**

**9.Re1**

**9...Nh5**

**10.d4 Qf6 11.Nbd2**

**11...b5**

11...Nf4 12.Nf1 is a worse version for Black, as we keep the option of trading on c6 whenever we want.

**12.Bc2 exd4 13.e5**

This is still super dangerous for Black.

**13...dxe5 14.cxd4 Bxd4 15.Bxh7+**

A cute tactical point, but 15.Ne4 is also promising.

**15...Kxh7 16.Ne4**

Now the h5-knight is loose.

**16...Qd8 17.Nxd4 Nxd4 18.Qxh5+ Kg8 19.Qxe5**

Our 3 vs 2 on the kingside gives us the safer king long term.

### (517) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3 Ba7 9.Re 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 Bc5**

**9.Re1**

**9...Nh5**

**10.d4 Qf6 11.Nbd2**

**11...b5**

**12.Bc2 Nf4 13.Nf1 g5**

This is Black's point. It looks a bit bizarre, but the f4-knight is really a very strong piece, and Black can continue attacking with Kh8, Rg8 next. It's very provocative, but the position is surprisingly tricky for us to handle.

**14.Ne3**

Intending to immediately utilize the weak f5-square.

**14...Kh8**

Undoubtedly Black's best reply. ...Rg8 followed by g4 is now on the agenda, so we have to act fast!

**15.Nf5**

The most direct move.

**15...Rg8 16.Nh2**

is very good for us, as we are in time to stop the counterplay.

### (518) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3 Ba7 9.Re

**14.Ne3**

**14...Kh8**

**15.Nf5**

**15...Bxf5 16.exf5 exd4**

Not only winning a pawn, but also creating a square on e5 for Black's knight.

**17.h4**

The most challenging move. If we break the pawn g5/Nf4 constellation the Black position just collapses.

**17...d3**

The only move to get counterplay.

**18.Bxd3 Nxd3 19.Qxd3**

Material equality is restored and Black is not exactly attacking anymore, but the position is still very sharp.

**19...g4 20.Qe4**

Trading knights, as we really don't want to let the Black knight go to e5.

**20...gxf3 21.Bg5**

A useful intermediate move.

**21...Qg7 22.f6 Qg6 23.Qxc6**

We are almost doing very well, but Black has an idea.

**23...h6**

Winning the bishop, as there's a checkmate on g2 looming.

**24.Qxf3 hxg5 25.hxg5**

For the bishop we have only 2 pawns, but the Black king is very exposed and our pawns on f6 and g5 are worth a lot. Next, we intend to play g3, Kg2, and give mate along the h-file. With accurate defence, it looks like black is probably surviving, but it's very tricky.

**25...Qxg5**

This would be a dreadful blunder.

**26.Re4**

With massive material losses to follow shortly for Black.

### (520) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3 Ba7 9.Re

**24.Qxf3 hxg5 25.hxg5**

**25...Rae8 26.g3**

Intending Kg2, Rh1.

**26...Qxg5 27.Kg2 Re6**

eliminates the f6-pawn, but too late!

**28.Rh1+ Kg8 29.Rh4 Rxf6 30.Rg4**

and Black will be mated on the h-file

### (521) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3 Ba7 9.Re 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 Bc5**

**25...Rae8 26.g3**

**26...Re6 27.Kg2 Kg8 28.Rxe6**

28.Rh1 Bxf2!! is the only move to save Black, which certainly isn't easily spotted from a distance!

**28...fxe6 29.Qf4 Kf7 30.Rh1**

And the attack continues, but so does Black's defensive possibilities. It all looks very scary to me, but the engine insits on a 0.00 evaluation.

### (522) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3 Ba7 9.Re 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d3 Bc5**

**6.c3**

**6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3**

**8...Ba7**

**9.Re1**

**9...Ne7**

This is by far the main move. Black intends to reroute the knight to g6, where it is always excellently placed in these structures.

**10.d4**

Setting up our nice centre.

**10...Ng6 11.Bc2**

11.Nbd2 intending 12.Bc2 will be the same.<addz start="12.Bc2"/>

**11...Re8 12.Nbd2**

A fairly common position, but one which I think is very pleasant for us. Next we simply intend Nf1-g3, further strengthening our centre.

**12...h6 13.a4**

Is an interesting way of playing, just grabbing more space on the queenside and not committing the knight to f1 yet.

**13...Bd7 14.a5 Bc6**

Was tried by Nakamura against Carlsen, but here Carlsen played in very nice fashion.

**15.Ra3**

A strange-looking but quite a useful move. We want to continue grabbing space with b4, but first making sure that nothing is hanging in the centre. 15.b4 d5! gives Black some counterplay as c3 is hanging later on.

**15...Qc8 16.b4**

Gave White a pleasant edge in Carlsen-Nakamura, 2017.

**10.d4**

**10...Ng6 11.Bc2**

**11...Re8 12.Nbd2**

**12...b5 13.Nf1 Bb7 14.Ng3 d5**

An attempt to break free immediately, played by for instance Grischuk and Ponomariov. Otherwise, we just have our typical position with a small but pleasant edge.

**15.Nxe5 Nxe4 16.Nd3**

leaves Black with very passive bishops.

### (524) 24. Alternative: Anderssen Var,5...Bc5 - 6...d6 7.O-O O-O 8.h3 Ba7 9.Re

**11...Re8 12.Nbd2**

**12...b5 13.Nf1 Bb7 14.Ng3 d5**

**15.Nxe5 dxe4**

This is normally quite a risky reaction for Black in these positions. Without giving us a weakness on e5, Black is seriously risking just losing the e4-pawn for nothing.

**16.Ng4**

Is the most direct way. We trade off the f6-knight after which the e4-pawn simply falls.

**16...Nxg4 17.Qxg4**

Black can't defend e4, leaving us a healthy pawn up.

**15.Nxe5 Nxe5 16.dxe5 Nxe4**

Almost always the only move in such positions.

**17.Nxe4 dxe4 18.Qxd8 Raxd8 19.Bf4**

Was Gashimov-Grischuk in 2011. The e4-pawn is weak and although sacrificing it gives decent drawing chances, it's still a free-roll for White.

### (340) 17. 4th Move Alternatives - 4...Bc5 #1 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Bc5**

A line favoured by the israeli grandmaster Tamir Nabaty, and recently picked up by Jorden Van Foreest on his way to win the Tata Steel Masters. As a surprise weapon it worked very well, but objectively speaking it looks rather dodgy.

**5.c3 Nge7**

The idea. The knight goes to g6 to support the e5-pawn, and avoids the possibility of a Bg5-pin later on. The downside is that it costs an additional move and that the knight isn't contributing to the fight for the centre from g6.

**6.O-O**

We want to push d4, but by starting with O-O we avoid Black's Bb4+ after the trade of pawns in the centre. 6.d4 exd4 7.cxd4 Bb4+ followed by d5 isn't as clear.

**6...Ng6 7.d4 Ba7**

Black keeps the stronghold on e5.

**8.Bg5**

A small subtlety, provoking ...f6.

**8...f6 9.Be3 O-O 10.Nbd2**

Van Foreest's opponent Aryan Tari instead got tempted to push d5-d6, but that is not necessary. By making normal, natural developing moves instead of trying too hard to punish Black we will get a solid edge.

**10...d6 11.Re1 exd4 12.Nxd4 Nxd4 13.cxd4 f5 14.exf5 Bxf5 15.Qb3+**

is one of the reasons why Kh8 is useful.

### (341) 17. 4th Move Alternatives - 4...Bc5 #2 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Bc5**

**5.c3 Nge7**

**6.O-O**

**6...Ng6 7.d4 Ba7**

**8.Bg5**

**8...f6 9.Be3 O-O 10.Nbd2**

**10...d6 11.Re1 Kh8**

Black's only real try for counterplay is the ...f5-push, therefore the king should get out of the a2-g8 diagonal.

**12.h3**

Calm and collected. If Black does nothing we can continue to improve slowly with Bc2 and Nf1-g3.

**12...f5 13.exf5 Bxf5 14.Bxc6 bxc6 15.dxe5**

Just wins a pawn for us.

### (342) 17. 4th Move Alternatives - 4...Bc5 #3 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Bc5**

**5.c3 Nge7**

**6.O-O**

**6...Ng6 7.d4 Ba7**

**8.Bg5**

**8...f6 9.Be3 O-O 10.Nbd2**

**10...d6 11.Re1 Kh8**

**12.h3**

**12...exd4**

Necessary in order to push ...f5.

**13.Nxd4**

Generally speaking it would also make sense to keep the knights, but we have a concrete idea in mind.

**13...Nxd4 14.cxd4 f5**

The only logical follow-up.

**15.Nf3**

Threatening to win the queen!

**15...f4 16.Bd2**

would be totally bad for Black, as there is no longer any counterplay along the f-file.

### (343) 17. 4th Move Alternatives - 4...Bc5 #4 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Bc5**

**5.c3 Nge7**

**6.O-O**

**6...Ng6 7.d4 Ba7**

**8.Bg5**

**8...f6 9.Be3 O-O 10.Nbd2**

**10...d6 11.Re1 Kh8**

**12.h3**

**12...exd4**

**13.Nxd4**

**13...Nxd4 14.cxd4 f5**

**15.Nf3**

**15...h6**

saves the queen, but is pretty slow.

**16.e5 dxe5 17.dxe5**

We are just much better. The black king is weak, we are better centralized and we have a passed pawn on e5.

### (344) 17. 4th Move Alternatives - 4...Bc5 #5 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Bc5**

**5.c3 Nge7**

**6.O-O**

**6...Ng6 7.d4 Ba7**

**8.Bg5**

**8...f6 9.Be3 O-O 10.Nbd2**

**10...d6 11.Re1 Kh8**

**12.h3**

**12...exd4**

**13.Nxd4**

**13...Nxd4 14.cxd4 f5**

**15.Nf3**

**15...Nh4**

Saving the queen by tactical means.

**16.exf5 Bxf5 17.Ng5**

is very, very good for White as Qh5 can't be stopped in any good way.

### (345) 17. 4th Move Alternatives - 4...Bc5 #6 

**1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Bc5**

**5.c3 Nge7**

**6.O-O**

**6...Ng6 7.d4 Ba7**

**8.Bg5**

**8...f6 9.Be3 O-O 10.Nbd2**

**10...d6 11.Re1 Kh8**

**12.h3**

**12...exd4**

**13.Nxd4**

**13...Nxd4 14.cxd4 f5**

**15.Nf3**

**15...Nh4**

**16.exf5 b5**

The best try, but not enough.

**17.Nxh4**

There are other ways, but this is simple and effective.

**17...Qxh4 18.Bc2 Bxf5 19.Bxf5 Rxf5 20.a4**

Black has managed to restore material equality and we are not winning anything immediately, but the c-file and Black's queenside pawns are very vulnerable. It might look threatening with the queen on h4 and rook on f5, but we have our own weakness on f2 very safely protected, and Black's bishop will never be able to join the attack.
