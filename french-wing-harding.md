Тим Хардинг

This gambit is recommended for White by GM Nigel Davies in his video "Dirty Tricks I" from Grandmaster Video Publications. I was already aware that this was a dangerous line, having played it with both colors in correspondence games.

As can be seen from my game with Schechter in the Introduction, even when it appears that White has no compensation for the gambit pawn he may actually have quite a lot, and one slip can plunge Black into the pit!

The first time I had to face it with Black, I managed to avoid getting into trouble but I never had real winning chances either:

C.B.Baker-Harding corr. (BPCF S3), 1986

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4**

The Wing Gambit against the Sicilian Defence does not have a great reputation but this means the French version of it is often underestimated. As you can see in the diagram, the blocked center in the French form of the gambit reduces Black's options for counterplay considerably. It is much harder for him to disturb White's plans with the e-file blocked and the d-file semi-blocked.

This is the main line, although in the game Corrigan-Harding, Irish Corr. Ch, 1995-6, I had to meet the strange 4.Nc3!? Nc6 5.Bb5 Bd7 6.d3 Qb6 (6...Qa5 7.Bd2) 7.O-O. At first sight this is rubbish, but after some study I realised that not only is 7...Nxe5?? 8.Nxe5 Bxb5 9.Qh5 g6 10.Nxg6 fxg6 11.Qe5 good for White but also that 7...d4!? is not so clear either after 8.Bxc6 Bxc6 9.Ne4. So I played 7...Nge7 which seems satisfactory for Black. After 8.Bg5 Ng6 9.Re1 h6 10.Bc1 Be7 11.Bxc6 Bxc6 12.a4 O-O 13.b3 d4 14.Ne4 Qc7 15.Ned2 b6 16.Bb2 Rfd8 17.Kh1?! a6, Mr. Corrigan unfortunately died; the game was cancelled according to competition rules.

**4...cxb4**

Maybe Black should decline the gambit? A recurring theme in this chapter is that, without his c5-pawn, Black just does not "bite" on the center and the normal French Defence counterplay themes are unavailable to him throughout.

True, Black does have an extra pawn, but unless he can find some way to support the advance of the a-pawn and queen it before he gets mated, or else exchange enough pieces to make it count in an endgame, this is likely to be an irrelevance.

Black's options for declining the gambit are discussed later in the chapter.

**5.a3 Nh6!?**

This is possibly one of the more interesting moves. Black's problem in the whole variation is that, cramped by the e5- pawn, his kingside pieces are hard to develop. The idea is to route the knight via h6 to f 5 where it can press on d4, without interfering with the action of the bishop.

Since there is a likelihood that the knight will be kicked by g2- g4, Stefan Buecker has suggested that the idea should be prefaced by 5...h5!? and only later ...Nh6 but can Black afford this slow and decentralised manoeuvre?

**6.axb4**

Black would be happy to meet 6.d4 Nf5 7.g4?! as this advance is premature.

For a more dynamic White idea, see a little further on.

**6...Bxb4 7.c3 Be7 8.d4 Nf5 9.Na3**

This may be premature. The Danish master Mortensen handled the position differently on two occasions:

a) 9.g4?! (still too soon) 9...Nh4 10.Nxh4 Bxh4 11.Bd3 Nc6 12.O-O Be7 13.f4 Bd7 14.Nd2 Qc7 15.Ba3 Bxa3 16.Rxa3 h5 and Black went on to win in Mortensen-Farago, Esbjerg 1985; if 17.g5 g6 followed by ...O-O-O.

b) 9.Bd3! was played in the very instructive game Mort- ensen-Tisdal!, Torshavn 1987: 9...Nc6 (If 9...h5!? 10.g3 with the idea h3, Kf1-g2, g4) 10.g4! Nh4 11.Nxh4 Bxh4 12.O-O f5? (He had to try 12...Bd7 13.f4 Be7. If 12...g6!? as suggested in ECO, then 13.f4 f5 14.exf6 Bxf6 15.g5 Bg7 16.h4!? followed by Ra2, h5.) 13.gxf5 exf5 14.Qh5+ g6 15.Qh6± (Threat Qg7) 15...Kf7 16.Na3 Be7 (If 16...a6 then 17.Nb5 anyway.) 17.Nb5 Be6 18.Ba3 Bg5 19.Nd6+! (Now White will get the dark squares unopposed.) 19...Qxd6 20.Qxg5 Qd8 21.Qh6 a6 22.Rfb1 b5 23.Bc1! Ra7 24.Ra2! Ke8 25.Rba1 (White plays on both wings of the board.) 25...Qb6 26.Qh4! Rf8 27.Ba3 b4 28.Bxb4 Nxb4 29.cxb4 Qxb4 30.Rxa6 Rxa6 31.Rxa6 Bc8 32.Ra8 Qb7 33.Bb5+! 1-0.

**9...Bd710.Bd3**

Against 10.Rb1 Qc8 11.Nb5? I planned 11...a6 12.Qa4 Nc6. White handles the position in a calm way and I never felt I had winning chances.

**10...Nc6 11.g4**

Putting the boot in. As in the 3 es lines where this motif sometimes occurs also, the question is whether White's pawnstorm will be effective or whether he will be left with kingside holes on the light squares. Now my game with Baker continued:

**11...Nh4 12.Nxh4 Bxa3!? 13.Bxa3 Qxh4 14.Rb1 b6 15.Bb5 f5 16.Qa4 Rc8 17.Bxc6 Rxc6 18.Qxa7 Qxg4 19.Qb8+ Kf7 20.Qxh8 Qe4+ 21.Kd2 Qf4+ 22.Kc2 Rc8 23.Qxc8** (23.Qxh7 Qxd4 24.Qh5+ Kg8) **23...Bxc8 24.Bd6 Qxf2+ 25.Kb3 Ba6 26.Ka3 Qd2 27.Rxb6 Qxc3+ 28.Ka4 g5?! 29.Rxa6 Qxd4+ 1/2-1/2.**

More dynamic for White against 5...Nh6 is 6.h4!? as in Buecker-Rohlmann, Lengerich, 1987:

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4 cxb4 5.a3 Nh6 6.h4! f5** (6...Nf5 7.g4) **7.axb4 Bxb4 8.c3 Be7 9.d4 Nf7 10.Bd3 Bd7**

Maybe 10...Nc6!? is better. Now White has a typical French Wing Gambit attack:

(see diagram on next page)

**11.g4! fxg4 12.Ng5 Bxg5 13.hxg5 g6 14.Qxg4 Nc6 15.Ba3 Qxg5 16.Qxg5 Nxg5 17.Bxg6+ Nf7 18.Bh5! Ne7 19.Bc5 a6 20.Nd2 Bb5? 21.Nf3 h6 22.Kd2 Nf5 23.Rhg1 Bd7 24.Rg2 Rc8 25.Ba3 Rc4 26.Rag1 1-0.**

Let us now look at the whole Wing Gambit line from an analytical point of view.

**Analytical Section**

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5 c5**

If 3...Bd7!? Buecker suggested 4.a3 c5 5.b4.

**4.b4 cxb4**

Black can decline the pawn:

a) **4...d4!?** 5.bxc5 Bxc5 when:

a1) 6.c3 Nc6 (not 6...d3 7.Qb3 Nc6 8.Qb5!) 7.Bd3 Nge7 8.O-O Ng6 9.Re1 Bd7 10.Re4 f5! 11.exf6 Qxf6 12.Bb2 Nf4 13.Bf1 O-O 14.cxd4 Bb6 15.g3 e5 16.dxe5 (16.gxf4 Qg6+ 17.Ng5 Rxf4!) 16...Qg6 17.Rxf4 Rxf4 18.Bg2 Rf7 19.d4 Bg4 20.h3 Bxf3 21.Bxf3 Nxd4! 22.Bxd4 (22.Bd5 Ne6 or 22.Bh5 Nf3+ 23.Qxf3 Rxf3 24.Bxg6 Rxf2) 22...Rd8 23.Bh5 Rxd4! 24.Qe2 Rd1+ 25.Kg2 Qe4+ 0-1, Boyarinov-Kantorovich, Gorky, 1977.

a2) 6.Ba3! Qa5 (6...Qe7 leads to the same position after the next move.) 7.Bxc5 Qxc5 8.c3 Nc6 9.cxd4 Nxd4 10.Qa4+ Nc6 11.Nc3 Qa5!? (11...Qb4 12.Qxb4 Nxb4 13.Rb1 Nc6 14.Nb5 Ke7 15.Nd6 b6 16.Bb5 with a big advantage to White - Boersma) 12.Qg4 Kf8 (12...Nge7 13.Qxg7 Rf8 14.Qxh7 Bd7 was necessary, and not 14...Nxe5? 15.Bb5+ N5c6 16.Ne4 with advantage to White) 13.Qf4 Nge7 14.Bd3 Ng6 15.Bxg6 hxg6 16.O-O Rh5 17.g4 and White had a big plus in Boersma-Korchnoi, Netherlands 1977.

In Buecker-Schmittdiel, German Championship 1991, Black played 11...Nh6 12.Ne4 Qb4 instead and got a quick draw (see Study Material) but I don't think he would have equalised so easily had White now played 13 Bb5!.

b) **4...c4** should be met not by 5.a3?! as has sometimes been seen, but by 5.c3 a5 6.b5 Nd7 7.d4 (or 7.d3 cxd3, etc.) 7...cxd3 8.Bxd3 with two examples from high-level play:

b1) 8...Qc7 9.Qe2 Ne7 10.O-O Ng6 11.Re1 with clear advantage to White, e.g., 11...Be7 12.h4 Bxh4 13.Nxh4 Nxh4 14.Ba3 Qd8 15.Qh5 Ng6 16.c4 dxc4 17.Bxg6 fxg6 18.Qg4 Nb6 19.Nc3 g5 20.Qh5+ g6 21.Qh6 Qd7 22.Rad1 Nd5 23.Rxd5 exd5 24.e6 1-0, E.Mortensen-J. Hansen, Gausdal zonal, 1987.

b2) 8...Ne7 9.O-O Ng6 10.Qe2 Bc5 11.Re1 O-O (Martens- Romero Holmes, Wijk aan Zee B 1991) and now in ChessBase Magazine, GM Knaak recommended 12.h4! (with the idea 12...Nxh4? 13.Bxh7+ Kxh7 14.Ng5+ Kg6 15.Qg4+− with the double threat Nxe6+ and Qxh4.

b3) 8...Nc5 9.Bc2 see Dovzik-Feher in the Study Material for this chapter.

c) **4...b6!?** tries to keep control of d4 by maintaining a pawn at c5. It's a virtually unexplored possibility.

Maurits Wind then suggested 5.d4 and if 5...cxd4 (or 5...cxb4 which is like the main line of the gambit) then 6.a3. Wind also analysed 5.bxc5 bxc5 6.c4!? (or 6.d4) 6...Nc6 7.cxd5 exd5 8.Bb5 Bd7 9.O-O Nge7 10.Nc3 Nd4 11.Bxd7+ Qxd7 12.Nxd4 cxd4 (Rahls-Bohm, San Bernardino 1982) 13.Ne2!? Nc6 14.Re1 Bc5? 15.e6 fxe6 16.Nf4 Nd8 17.Qh5+ g6 (17...Qf7 18.Nxe6) 18.Nxg6 Qf7 19.Qe5.

Instead, White can just play 5.c3 Qd7 (intending ...cxb4) 6.a3, e.g., 6...d4!? 7.cxd4! cxb4 8.d5! Qxd5? (8...exd5!? 9.d4 with some advantage to White - Mortensen) 9.axb4 Bxb4 10.Qa4+ Nc6 11.Bb5 Bd7 12.O-O (Not 12.Bxc6 Qxc6 13.Qxb4? Qxc1+) 12...Nge7 (Mortensen-Bjerring, Denmark 1986) and now 13.Rd1!! (intending Nc3) would have given White a clear advantage according to Mortensen in Informant 44 and cited in ECO.

d) 4...Nc6!? was seen in Flaata-Fant, Gausdal Troll 1996: 5.bxc5 d4!? 6.c3 Bxc5 7.Bb2 Nge7 8.cxd4 Bb6 9.Nc3 Nxd4 10.Ne4 Nxf3+ 11.Qxf3 O-O 12.Bd3 Nf5 and now 13.h4!? (Cafferty) is interesting. What could White reply instead? Of course 5.a3 would transpose to main lines after 5...cxb4 but could look a bit silly otherwise, but 5.Bb2 cxb4 6.Bb5 Bd7 7.Qe2 seems a sound option, with rapid development and difficulties for Black in defending the advanced b-pawn.

Returning to our position after:

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4 cxb4**

White has a major decision here, whether to secure his central hold at once by 5.d4 as the German player Peter Rahls seems to prefer, or to speed development by 5.a3. Of course transpositions are possible.

We shall take:

**A: 5.a3** as the main line

**B: 5.d4** lines particular to this move will be looked at later.

**A:**

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4 cxb4**

**5.a3**

Now Black has three main ideas:

**A1: 5...bxa3**

**A2: 5...Nc6**

**A3: 5...d4**

5...Nh6!? (5...h5!?) has already been discussed above.

There have also been experiments with:

a) 5...Qa5!? is potentially awkward for White but offends against the principle of not bringing the queen out into the open early in a game. Can this be exploited? The move should be met by 6.Bb2 according to Mortensen in lnformant 44. (Not 6.d4?! Bd7! followed by . Bb5 which is Black's main idea.)

(Analysis diagram after 5...Qa5!? 6.Bb2)

An example is Gasic-de Veauce, Birmingham, England 1974: 6...Nc6 7.Be2 Bd7 8.axb4 Qxb4 9.Ba3 Qf4 10.g3 Qf5 11.Bxf8 Kxf8 12.d4 f6 13.exf6 Nxf6 14.Bd3 Qh3 15.Nbd2 e5 16.Nxe5 Nxd4 17.c3 Nc6 18.Nxd7+ Nxd7 19.Qf3+ Nf6 20.Bf5 Re8+ 21.Kd1 Qh6 22.Bc2 Qg5 23.Ba4 Re7 24.Bxc6 bxc6 25.Re1 Rb7 26.h4 Qg6 27.Re6 Kf7 28.Rxc6 Rhb8 29.Qf4 Kg8 30.Rc7 Rb2 31.Raxa7 Qc2+ 32.Ke2 Re8+ 33.Kf1 Kh8 34.Rxg7 Qxd2 35.Qxf6 Re1+ 36.Kg2 Qxf2+ and Black resigned.

But 6.Bb2 did not work so well in Hendriks-Narkytan, European Corr. Ch 1994: 6...Bd7 7.axb4 Qxb4 8.Ba3 Qe4+ 9.Be2 Bxa3 10.Nxa3 Ne7 11.d4 Ng6 12.g3 O-O 13.h4 Ne7 14.O-O Qg6 15.Nh2 f5 16.Bh5 Qh6 17.f4 Ba4 18.Kg2 Nd7 19.Be2 Nb6 20.h5 Rfc8 21.Rh1 Rc3 22.Nf3 Rac8 23.Ra2 Be8 24.Nb1 R3c7 25.c3 a6 26.Ng5 Nc4 27.Kf2 Bb5 28.Bd3 Rf8 29.Qf3 b6 30.Kg1 a5 31.Rh4 Ra7 32.Nh3 a4 33.g4 fxg4 34.Rxg4 Nf5 35.Rg5 Nfe3 36.Qg3 Kh8 37.Nf2 g6 38.Ng4 Nxg4 39.hxg6 Ncxe5 40.dxe5 Bxd3 41.Rxg4 Bxb1 42.Rh2 Qxg6 43.Rxg6 Bxg6 44.Qf2 Raf7 45.Rh4 a3 46.Qxb6 Ra8 0-1. This is such a complicated game that it is hard to be sure whether or not White missed something; his plan of embarrassing the Black queen seemed very close to success at times. Maybe 7.Be2 should have been played as there appears to be no immediate necessity for 7.axb4.

b) 5...f5 does not cut across White's plans. In Dovzik-Gen- tilleau, Cannes open 1992, White proceeded with 6.axb4 Bxb4 7.c3 Be7 8.d4 Bd7 9.h4 Nh6 (9...Nc6 would lead to positions similar to line A 1 below.) 10.Bxh6 gxh6 11.Qd2 Bf8 12.Be2 Bg7 13.Na3 O-O 14.O-O Bc6 15.Nb5 Bxb5 16.Bxb5 Nd7 (Delaying the development of this piece has only helped White.) 17.c4 dxc4 18.Bxc4 Qe7 19.Qa5 Rfe8 20.Rfb1 Nb6 21.d5 exd5 22.Bxd5+ Kh8 23.Rxb6 axb6 24.Qxa8 Rxa8 25.Rxa8+ Bf8 26.Nd4 Qxe5 27.Ne6 Qe1+ 28.Kh2 Qe5+ 29.f4 1-0

c) Black can return the pawn by 5...b3 6.cxb3 Nc6 but clearly there is nothing for White to fear now. Instead of 7.d4, the right plan is probably 7.Bb2 followed by Be2, O-O and a fight for control of the open c-file.

**A1:**

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4 cxb4 5.a3**

**5...bxa3**

This would seem to fall in with White's plans rather too generously. True, Black immediately gets a passed a-pawn but he is unlikely to be able to queen it in the early middle game. Now White has a broad "shot selection": he can support d4 comfortably and also get his queenside pieces into play without worrying about timing of captures by Black.

**6.d4**

This immediately rules out any ...d4 tricks and ensures White a firm grip on the center for the opening and early middle game.

A totally different plan for White, only available from this move order, is 6.Bxa3!? when:

a) 6...Ne7?! 7.d4 Nbc6 8.Bd3 Bd7 9.O-O Nc8 10.Bxf8 Kxf8 11.Qd2! Nb6 12.Qf4 h6 13.Na3 a6 14.Rfb1 Qc7 15.c4! dxc4 16.Nxc4 Nxc4 17.Bxc4 Ne7 18.Rc1 Qd8 19.Nd2! with clear advantage (targets at d6 and fl), e.g., 19...Ng6 20.Qe3 Bc6 21.Ne4 Qh4? (Better is 21...Ne7!? as 21...Bxe4 22.Qxe4 favors White.) 22.Bd3 a5 23.g3 Qh3? (23 ...QdB was necessary.) 24.Bf1 Qg4 25.Rxc6!! bxc6 26.Be2 Qh3 27.Nd6 (Threatening Qf3) 27...Ra7 28.d5 Ra8 29.dxc6 1-0, Linusson-Rydholm, corr., 1985-89.

b) 6...Bxa3 7.Nxa3 Ne7 is in need of more tests, after Walsh-Behrensen, Argentina 1984: 8.c3 Nbc6 9.d4 O-O 10.Bd3 Nf5 11.h4 h5?! (11...f6! unclear) 12.Nb5 Bd7 13.Ng5 g6 14.g4 Nxh4 15.Nf3 Ng2+ 16.Kf1 Nf4 17.gxh5 Nxh5 18.Qd2± f5 19.Qh6 Be8 20.Ke2 Ne7 21.Rag1 Bxb5 22.Rxh5 Bxd3+ 23.Kxd3 Kf7 24.Ng5+ Ke8 25.Nxe6 Qb6 26.Qxf8+ 1-0.

**6...Nc6**

This position is very important as it often arises from the alternative move order 5.d4 Nc6 6.a3 bxa3.<level/>

6...Nh6!? has also been seen. Sibilio-Mariotti, Italian Team Ch, 1982 went: 7.c3 (7.Bd3 - Wind) 7...Nf5 8.Nxa3 Nc6 9.Nb5 a6 10.g4 Bd7 11.Bg5 Be7 12.gxf5 axb5 13.fxe6 fxe6 14.Rxa8 Qxa8 15.Rg1 Qa3 16.Bxb5 Bxg5 17.Rxg5 Qxc3+ 18.Kf1 O-O 19.Bxc6 Bxc6 20.Kg2 Ba4 21.Qe2 Bc2 22.Ne1 Be4+ 23.f3 Rxf3? (This combination looks sound but overlooks a neat defence. 23...Bf5 wins.) 24.Nxf3 Bxf3+ 25.Qxf3 Qd2+ 26.Kh3! Qxg5 27.Qf8+! 1/2-1/2. After 27...Kxf8 it is stalemate!

**7.c3**

John Watson, in his Play The French, makes an interesting suggestion against 7.Bxa3, which has the same idea as 6.Bxa3. He gives 7...Nge7 8.Bd3 Bd7 9.O-O Nc8! 10.Bxf8 Kxf8 followed by ...Nb6, claiming advantage for Black.<level start="6.Bxa3"/>

**7...Bd7**

The common sequence 7...f5 8.Bd3 Bd7 transposes at once.

Some other moves have been seen:

a) 7...Nge7 when:

(see diagram on next page)

a1) 8.Bxa3 (recapturing with the wrong piece in my opinion): 8...Ng6 9.Bxf8 (9.h4 Bxa3 10.Nxa3 f5! - J.Watson) 9...Nxf8 10.Bd3 f6 11.Na3 fxe5 12.Nxe5 Nxe5 13.dxe5 Ng6!? 14.Qh5 O-O 15.O-O (15.Bxg6 hxg6 16.Qxg6 Qc7) 15...Bd7 16.f4 Rc8 with some advantage to Black in Bosch-Blees, Dieren 1988.

a2) 8.Bd3 and now:

a21) Schiriaev-Leis, European master class corr. 1977-80, was a good example of a White crush: 8...Ng6 9.h4 Be7 10.h5 Nf8 11.Nxa3 Nd7 12.Qc2 h6 13.g4! Nb6 14.Rg1 Bxa3 15.Bxa3 Na5 16.g5 Nac4 17.Bc5 Qc7 18.g6 Bd7 19.gxf7+ 1-0. This was actually a tournament I played in myself, so I know the players were strong.

a22) Watson recommends 8...Bd7 9.Nxa3 a6 claiming an advantage for Black, as in Haub- Przewoznik, Berlin 1993, but it is hard to draw conclusions from games like this: White is an unknown and Black an established master. In fact, White's next move was 10.g4?! when the correct plan, a la Rahls, is 10.h4 followed by Rh3. The move g2-g4 makes sense when it attacks a Black pawn on f5 (see the main line and Keres game below) but should not be played just to prevent ... Nf5.

b) 7...f6!? 8.Bd3 fxe5 9.dxe5 Qc7 10.Qe2 Nge7 (10...Nh6 11.O-O Nf7 12.Re1 Buecker-Poldauf, German Ch 1991; see illustrative games) 11.O-O Ng6 12.Re1 Bc5 13.Bxg6+ hxg6 14.Bxa3 Qa5 15.Bxc5 Qxc5 16.Na3 Bd7 17.Qd3 Ne7 18.Reb1 b6 19.Nd4 Nf5 20.Nab5 a5 21.g4 Nh4 22.Nd6+ Kf8 23.Ra2 a4 24.Rb4 Kg8 25.Nb3 Qc7 26.Rf4 Kh7 27.Qg3 g5 28.Qd3+ Kg8 29.Rf7 Rf8 30.Rxf8+ Kxf8 31.Nd4 Kg8 32.Qe3 Ng6 33.Qxg5 Rh6 34.Qe3 Qc5 35.f4 Rh4 36.Qg3 b5 37.Kh1 Rh7 38.f5 Nf8 39.Rf2 Rh8 40.fxe6 Nxe6 41.N4f5 1-0, Preziuso-Monn, corr., Switzerland, 1994.

c) 7...Nh6 8.Bd3 f6!? 9.O-O (9.Bxh6 gxh6 10.Nh4!? Qe7! unclear) 9...Nf7 10.exf6 Qxf6 11.Nxa3 a6 12.Re1 Bd6 13.Nc2!? O-O 14.Ne3 Ng5? (better is 14...Bd7) 15.Nxg5 Qxg5 16.Nf5! Bf4 17.h4! Qf6 18.Bxf4 exf5 19.g3 Be6 20.Qb3 Qf7 21.Re2 Qd7 22.Rb2 Rf7 23.Qb6! h6 24.Rab1 Nd8 25.Qa5 Rc8 26.Rb6 Rc6 27.Rxc6 Nxc6 28.Qc5 Nd8!? 29.Rb6 Qc8 30.Qd6 Qd7?! 31.Qb8 Rf8 32.Bc7 Nc6 33.Qxb7 Na5 34.Qxa6 Qxc7 35.Qxa5 f4 36.Qc5! 1-0, Savory-Cox, BPCF open Final VI, corr., 1994.

Did White play the right plan? Instead of 8.Bd3, Savory said 8.Bxh6!? gxh6 9.Nxa3 Bd7 is unclear, but Nigel Davies on his video advises playing Bxh6 when such an opportunity arises.

d) 7...a6 8.Nxa3 (Wind suggests 8.Bd3 Bd7 9.Ng5.) 8...Bd7 9.Be3 (Also playable is 9.Bd3 Be7 10.O-O Rc8 11.Nc2 Na5 12.Nd2 Qb6 13.Rb1 Qa7 14.Qg4 g6 15.c4 f5 16.Qh3 and 1-0, 27 in Vaisman-llyin, Romania, 1973) 9...f5 (9...b5 could be met by 10.Ng5 wrote Wind; 9...h6! is probably best he said.) 10.g4 g6 11.gxf5 exf5 12.Qe2 Be6 13.Ng5 Qe7 14.Nb5! 1-0 Keres-Remgelter, corr., 1935-36. Resignation seems premature but White has a very strong attack against the king stuck in the center.

**8.Bd3 f5**

This attempt to block the kingside allows White to play an undermining plan.

One alternative that might be tried is 8...a6 (to rule out Nb5) while for 8...Rc8 see Thomsen-Thompson below.

**9.h3**

The immediate 9.g4!? has also been seen:

a) 9...g6 10.gxf5 gxf5 11.Ng5 h5 12.Be2 1-0, Vangsgaard- Drechsler, EU master class corr., 1991.

b) 9...Nge7 and now:

b1) 10.Bxa3!? (10.Nxa3!? - Wind) 10...fxg4 11.Ng5 Nf5 12.Qxg4 h5 13.Bxf5! exf5 (13...hxg4 14.Bg6 mate) 14.Qf4 Bxa3 15.Nxa3 unclear (Wind-Zilberstein, Biel 1980);

b2) 10.gxf5 Nxf5 11.Ng5 Nce7 (ECO suggested 11...Qe7 12.Nxa3 O-O-O.) 12.Nxa3 h6 13.Nh3 Qc7 14.Nb5 Bxb5 15.Bxb5+ Kf7 16.Bd2 g6 17.Rg1 a6 18.Bd3 Rg8 19.Nf4 Qc6 20.Qf3 b5 21.Rb1 Rb8 22.Qh3 Rb7 23.Kf1 Ke8 24.Kg2 g5 25.Nh5 Kd8 26.Kh1 Rg6 27.f4 with unclear play (draw, 64) Mortensen-Karlsson, Copenhagen, 1985.

**9...g6?!**

The Keres suggestion 9...Nge7 seems the real test here.

**10.g4**

The best example now is Shashin-Naglis, USSR 1970:

**10...Nh6 11.Nxa3 a6**

To stop N-b5-d6, a threat that usually gains White a tempo at some stage in this gambit.

**12.Bg5 Qc8**

12...Be7?? 13.Bxh6

**13.Bf6 Rg8 14.Qd2**

This proteats c3 and eyes the kingside.

White won in 28 moves. Nigel Davies in his Dirty Tricks I video says White is doing very well in this line.

Here is a similar, if imperfect, example:

**Carsten R.Thomsen-lain D.Thompson**

corr. WT/M\417, 1988

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4 cxb4 5.a3 bxa3 6.d4 Nc6 7.c3 Bd7 8.Bd3 Rc8 9.O-O**

I prefer the Rahls method. 9.h4, here.

**9...f5**

Cimmino suggested 9...Na5 10.Nxa3 a6 11.Bd2 Ne7 12.Rb1 b5 in the CC Yearbooks.

**10.g4 Be7?**

Better is 10...fxg4 11.Ng5 Nh6 12.Nxh7 Qh4 13.Nxf8 Nf5 14.Bf4 Rxf8

**11.gxf5 exf5 12.Nxa3 Be6 13.Kh1! a6 14.Rg1 Kf8 15.Bg5 Qd7 16.Nc2 Nd8 17.Qd2 Nf7 18.Rab1 g6 19.Rb3 Kg7 20.Rgb1 Rc7 21.Rb6 h6 22.Bf4 g5?**

**23.Bxf5! Nd8** (23...Bxf5 24.e6! or 23...gxf4 24.Bxe6 Qd8 25.Qxf4+−) **24.Bxe6 Nxe6 25.Be3 Rh7 26.Qd3 Kh8 27.Qf5 Nd8 28.e6 Qe8 29.Bd2 Rc6 30.Ne5 Rxb6 31.Rxb6 Rg7 32.c4 dxc4 33.d5! Qh5 34.Ne3 Bc5 35.Bc3 1-0.**

**A2:**

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4 cxb4 5.a3**

**5...Nc6**

This should be the superior move, developing a piece, keeping White guessing and maintaining a fluid position.

**6.axb4**

If White plays 6.d4 and Black replies 6...bxa3 then we have line A 1 above.

Other replies are discussed in 8.

**6...Bxb4**

For 6...Nxb4 7.c3 Nc6 see line A23.

**7.c3**

Black is now confronted with a choice somewhat similar to that faced in the main line of the Evans Gambit Accepted: where to retreat the bishop?

**A21: 7...Ba5**

**A22: 7...Be7**

**A23: 7...Bf8**

**A21:**

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4 cxb4 5.a3 Nc6 6.axb4 Bxb4 7.c3**

**7...Ba5**

Evans Gambit style. Black hinders Na3, hopes the bishop will be useful later on c7 or b6 and makes sure that it does not obstruct the king's knight.

**8.d4**

**8...f6!**

Suggested by John Watson. In this case, directly challenging the apex of the pawn chain seems justified. Otherwise Black will be castling into danger later. White must keep control of e5 and, in some cases, the exchange sacrifice RfBxNf3, after the opening of the f-file, will be a weapon to undermine this control.

Alternatives:

a) 8...Nge7 is quite popular and consistent with ...Ba5, but does not really cross White's plans for a rapid kingside attack. Walsh-lacobacci, Argentina 1986, continued 9.Bd3 f5 (9...h6 10.h4!) 10.g4 fxg4 11.Ng5 Nxd4 12.Qxg4 Ndf5 13.Ba3 d4 14.Bxf5 exf5 15.Qh5+ g6 16.Qh6 dxc3 17.O-O Ng8 18.Qf8+ Kd7 19.Rd1+ 1-0.

b) 8...Bd7 9.Bd3 Nge7 (9...h6!?-Wind) 10.O-O (10.Ng5 h6 11.Qh5 is unclear says Wind.) 10...O-O? 11.Ng5 g6 12.Qg4 Nf5 13.Qh3 h6 14.Bxf5 hxg5 15.Qh6!+− Wind- Sterkman, Biel 1980.

c) 8...f5!? has also been seen in amateur games but as we have already seen, this move usually gives White a target for a later g3-g4, sometimes prefaced by h2-h3.

**9.Bd3!?**

For 9.Bf4 see Harding-Schechter in the Introduction.

Another possibility for White is 9.Bb5 Bd7 10.Qa4 Nge7 11.Bh6!? gxh6 12.exf6.

**9...a6?**

Black had to try 9...fxe5 10.dxe5!? (10.Nxe5) 10...d4 11.O-O or 10...Nge7.

**10.O-O b5**

11.Bd2 Bb7 12.Re1 f5 13.g4 g6 14.Ng5 Qd7 15.gxf5 gxf5 16.Qh5+ Kd8 17.Nf7+ Kc7 18.Nxh8 Qg7+ 19.Kh1 Qxh8 20.Qf7+ Nge7 21.Rxa5 Nxa5 22.Qxe7+ Kb6 23.Qc5 mate 1-0, Heiberg-Hasson, Moscow women's olympiad, 1994.

**A22:**

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4 cxb4 5.a3 Nc6 6.axb4 Bxb4 7.c3**

**7...Be7**

This may be safer than 7...Ba5 as the bishop can play a role in defending its king, but it does get in the way of the knight here. How is that piece to be developed? That direction of thinking led to both the ... Nh6 ideas and to line A23.

Surprisingly, perhaps, 7 ...Be? appears to have been statistically the most successful of Black's answers to the French Wing Gambit.

**8.d4 Bd7**

Black has played this most often, but it is not best. Others:

a) 8...Nh6!? 9.Bd3 O-O 10.h4 or first 10.Na3.

b) 8...f6! seems very strong, e.g., Reinderman-Glek, Groningen open 1992: 9.Bd3 fxe5 10.Nxe5 (10.dxe5? Qc7) 10...Nf6 11.Bg5 (11.O-O is better, but still leaves White struggling to find compensation.) 11...Nxe5 12.dxe5 Ne4! 13.Bxe7 Qxe7 14.Bxe4 dxe4 15.Qd4 O-O 16.Qxe4 (16.Rxa7 Rxa7 17.Qxa7 Qg5 favored Black in Buturin-Glek, Belgorod 1989) 16...Bd7! 17.Qe3 (17.Qxb7 Qc5!) 17...Bb5 18.Nd2 Qc7 19.f4 Rad8 and Black went on to realise his advantage: 20.Ne4 Rd3 21.Qc5 Qxc5 22.Nxc5 Re3+ 23.Kf2 Rxe5 24.Nxb7 Rxf4+ 25.Kg3 Rf6 26.Nd6 Rg6+ 27.Kh4 Rxg2 28.Kh3 Bc6 0-1. White badly needs to come up with something new in this line, since the plan with h4 doesn't seem to make much sense against ...f6.

**9.Bd3 Na5**

If 9...a6 the plan for White is the same.

**10.h4!**

The Rahls formula. If 10...h6 (to stop Ng5) then 11.Rh3 followed by Rg3 with kingside pressure. "Where does Black's king go in this variation?", asks Nigel Davies on his video. If to the kingside, White has this h4 attack; if to the queenside, White has open a-and b-files.

There is a lack of convincing practical examples for White since players have often not followed the right plan, sometimes castling instead of playing h4. White had a shot at it in the following game but Black took counter-measures and a draw resulted in an unclear position:

**Spraggett-Ross**

Canadian Ch, 1989

1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4 cxb4 5.a3 Nc6 6.axb4 Bxb4 7.c3 Be7 8.d4 Bd7 9.Bd3 Rc8 10.h4 a6 11.Rh3 h6 12.Rg3 Bf8 13.Kf1 Na5 14.Kg1 Qb6 15.Bc2 Ne7 16.h5 Nf5 17.Rh3 Nc4 18.Ra2 Ne7 19.Nh4 Kd8 20.Rf3 Be8 21.Na3 Rc7 22.Rg3 Na5 23.Bd2 Nec6 24.Bd3 Kc8 25.Nc2 Nc4 26.Bxc4 dxc4 27.Ne3 Ne7 28.Qa1 1/2-1/2.

The most interesting example is the following in which White's attack proved very strong. Although his d-pawn dropped off at an apparently critical moment, he had made just enough progress by that stage:

**K.Bender-K.H.Wirtz**

corr. 1988

1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4 cxb4 5.a3 Nc6 6.axb4 Bxb4 7.c3 Be7 8.d4 Bd7 9.Bd3 h5 10.h4 Nh6 11.Ng5 Nf5 12.Qf3 g6 13.g4 hxg4 14.Qxg4 Rc8 15.h5 Ncxd4 16.Kf1 Bb5 17.Bxb5+ Nxb5 18.Nxf7 Kxf7 19.Qxg6+ Kf8 20.Rg1 Bh4 21.Qxe6 Ng7 22.Bh6 Rc7 23.Qf5+ Kg8 24.Qe6+ Kf8 25.Ra4 d4 26.Rc4 Rh7 27.Rg4 Bg5 28.Rxg5 Rxh6 29.Qxh6 Kg8 30.Rxg7+ Rxg7 31.Qe6+ Kh7 32.Qf5+ Kh6 33.Rc8 1-0.

**A23:**

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4 cxb4 5.a3 Nc6 6.axb4 Bxb4 7.c3**

**7...Bf8**

The same position (see diagram) can arise via 6...Nxb4 7.c3 Nc6.

![](french-4-gambits-imgs/Aspose.Words.b1ce08ac-5858-436d-9d4f-e73a040ca68c.020.png)

This retreat was played by Karpov in 1979 but it doesn't make any sense!

The idea is that on fB the bishop does not obstruct the king's knight going to el but if that is what Black wants to do, he should select a different sequence altogether.

Note that, although not an exact transposition, the position reached now is very similar to the line 5.a3 bxa3 6.d4 Nc6 7.c3 in which the bishop has not yet moved. Neither of the differences are in Black's favor: he is only one pawn ahead instead of (temporarily) two and, much more importantly, it is now White's move! The moral is that if Black wants his bishop on fB, he should capture on a3!

**8.d4 Bd7 9.Bd3**

Here 9.Ng5!? can be considered: 9...h6 (9...Be7!? or 9...f6 could be considered.) 10.Nxf7 Kxf7 11.Qf3+ Nf6 12.Bd3 (unclear said Wind).

Maybe the Rahls plan, 9.h4!?, is best immediately.

**9...h6 10.h4!**

Dankert-Karpov, Munich 1979, went instead 10.O-O?! Nge7 11.g3 a6 12.Nh4 g6 13.Be3?! b5 and White lacked sufficient compensation (0-1, 53). White's play was far too tentative and shows signs of being overawed by his opponent.

Instead of castling, Wind suggested 10.h4 a6 11.h5 Rc8 12.Nh4 to continue Qg4, Rh3.

We don't have a good example of this plan in action. E. Levi- J.P.Wallace, Auckland 1992, went 9...Nge7 (instead of 9...h6) but after 10.h4 h6 White helped his opponent by continuing 11.Ba3 Na5 12.Nbd2 Nec6 13.Bxf8 Rxf8 14.h5 Qc7 15O-O O-O-O and Black, whose king has escaped to an unweakened queenside, eventually won. White should have played 11.Na3, probing for ...a6, and then the manoeuvre R-h3-g3 before the king could get away.

**A3:**

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4 cxb4 5.a3**

**5...d4!?**

This is the main line in the 3<sup>rd</sup> edition of ECO Volume C, leading to an assessment of equality. The following game and notes are crucial.

A very interesting idea by the Norwegian player Rune Djur- huus to upset all White's plans. This game by grandmaster Uhlmann is inconclusive but the move 5...d4 is recommended for Black in the 2<sup>"d</sup> edition of John Watson's Play the French so you are quite likely to meet it.

**6.Bb2**

Others:

a) 6.axb4 Bxb4 7.Ba3 (or 7.c3 dxc3 8.Qa4+ Nc6 9.dxc3 Bc5!⩱ Watson) 7...Bxa3 8.Nxa3 Ne7 ("What does White have for his pawn?" asks Watson.) 9.Bd3 (9.Nb5 Nbc6 10.Nd6+ KfB) 9...Ng6 10.O-O Nc6 11.Re1 O-O was somewhat better for Black in Martens-Djurhuus, World Junior Ch., Santiago 1990.

b) 6.Bd3 Nc6 7.O-O Nh6 8.Qe2 (too slow) 8...Be7 9.Bb2 (wrong diagonal) 9...f5! 10.exf6 Bxf6 (Whitehead-Rohde, Lone Pine 1978) was a fumble in the dark, played before White's correct plans were understood.

**6...Nc6 7.Bb5**

7.Bd3!? was an Informant 51 suggestion by Djurhuus, repeated in ECO.

**7...Bd7 8.O-O!?**

Stefan Buecker, now editor of the German magazine Kaissi- ber, introduces a novelty which you won't find in ECO.

Instead the Encyclopaedia cites the analysis by Norwegian GM Djurhuus: 8.Qe2 a6 (or 8...Qb6!? which meets with Watson's approval) 9.Bxc6! Bxc6 10.Nxd4 Bxg2 11.Rg1 bxa3 (11...Bd5 12.axb4 with an edge to White) 12.Nxa3 Bd5 (12...Bc6 13.Nxc6 bxc6 14.Nc4 with compensation) 13.Nab5! (13.c4?! Bc6) 13...axb5 14.Qxb5+ Bc6 15.Nxc6 Rxa1+ 16.Bxa1 bxc6 17.Qxc6+ Qd7 18.Qa8+ Qd8 with a roughly equal position.

**8...Nxe5?**

Black falls into a trap. According to GM Knaak, and Watson, several moves would have given Black an acceptable position, e.g., 8...Qb6!? or 8...Nh6.

**9.Nxe5 Bxb5 10.Nxf7! Kxf7 11.Qh5+ g6 12.Qxb5 Qb6 13.Qc4 Bg7 14.axb4 Ne7 15.Na3 Rhc8 16.Qb3 Nd5 17.b5 a6 18.Rfe1 axb5 19.Nxb5 Rxa1 20.Bxa1** (20.Rxa1!?) **20...Rc6 21.Bb2 Bf6?**

21...Nc7! 22.Nxc7 (22.Qf3+ Kg8 23.Nxc7 Rxc7 24.Ra1 h5) 22...Qxb3 23.cxb3 Rxc7 24.Rc1 Rxc1+ 25.Bxc1 d3= Buecker

**22.Ba3± Nc7?**

Too late

**23.Qb4! e5 24.Qf8+ Ke6 25.Qc8+ Kd5**

25...Kf7 26.Qd7+ Kg8 27.Nxc7

**26.Qd7+ Kc4 27.Nc3! Qa5 28.Bf8 Qa8 29.Ne4 Qe8 30.Nd6+ Rxd6 31.Qxd6 Qc6 32.d3+** 1-0, S.Buecker-Uhl- mann,German Championship, 1991.

I leave you to draw your own conclusions. If you are worried about 5.a3 d4, then 5.d4 is playable. We consider that next.

**B:**

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4 cxb4**

**5.d4**

The main point of this move order is to rule out the option 5.a3 d4 just discussed, which could possibly be a refutation of the French Wing Gambit main line. There is a positive side to the move too: there are possibilities for White to play for an attack without a2-a3 at all. See the Littlewood game below for a different idea on how to handle the whole variation.

**5...Bd7!**

This leads to distinctive positions. Others:

a) 5...Nh6 6.a3 bxa3 see 5.a3 Nh6, etc., at the start of the chapter.<level/>

b) 5...Ne7 6.a3 Nec6 (6...Qa5 7.Bd3 Nbc6 8.O-O Bd7 9.Nbd2 was unclear in Stein-Bukal, Dortmund II 1987) 7.axb4 Bxb4+ 8.c3 Be7 9.Bd3 Nd7 10.h4 (Peter Rahls's patent move.) 10...f6? 11.Ng5! fxg5 12.Qh5+ Kf8 13.hxg5 Qe8 14.g6 h6 15.g4 Kg8 16.Rh3 Nf8 17.g5 Qd8 18.gxh6 Nd7 19.Rf3 Bf6 (He cannot allow the rook to reach fT.) 20.exf6 Nxf6 21.h7+ Rxh7 (Since White will now be a rook up, Black might as well have resigned. Maybe the bar had not yet opened? If 21 ...KfB 22.Bg5+−) 22.gxh7+ Kh8 23.Qf7 e5 24.Rxf6 e4 25.Rd6 Bd7 26.Rxd7 Qf8 27.Bb5 Nxd4 28.cxd4 Qb4+ 29.Bd2 Qxd4 30.Bc3 1-0, Rahls-Putzbach, Travemunde open, 1987.

c) Instead if 5...Nc6 and now:

c1) 6.a3 (similar to lines discussed earlier) 6...f6!? (for 6...bxa3 see A1; 6...Qb6!? and 6...Qa5!? also come into consideration.) 7.axb4 Black has tried:

c11) 7...Bxb4+ 8.c3 Ba5!? (compare A21) when John Watson analysed 9.exf6 Nxf6 10.Ba3 Bc7! or 9.Be3 fxe5 10.dxe5 Nh6!? (or 10...Nge7) 11.Bb5 Nf7 12.O-O Bd7 13.Qe2 Qc7 14.Re1 O-O-O! saying "in either case Black's position is fundamentally sound".

c12) 7...fxe5 8.b5!? (possibly not correct) 8...Nxd4 9.Nxe5 Qh4 10.g4! Bc5 (10...Nf5? 11.gxf5 Qe4+ 12.Qe2 Qxh1 13.Qh5+ g6 14.fxg6 Qe4+ 15.Be3 Nf6 16.g7+ Nxh5 17.gxh8=Q 1-0, Heiming-Staehler, 1984) 11.c3 Nf5 12.Nd3 with murky complications: 12...Bd6? 13.Ra4 d4 14.Qe2 Nfh6 15.Rxd4 Qe7 16.h3 e5 17.Ra4 Be6 18.c4 Nf7 19.Bg2 Rc8 20.Rxa7 Bxc4 21.Rxb7 Bb4+ 22.Bd2 Qd8 23.Bxb4 Bxd3 24.Qb2 e4 25.Nc3 Qd4 26.Qa2 Nd8 (clearly better for Black) 27.Qa7?? (White was an unsighted player and prone to occasional blunders.) 27...Qxb4 0-1, Baretic-Ton Timman (brother of Jan), Wijk aan Zee 111, 1974.

c2) 6.Bd3 Bd7 7.O-O!? (A totally different concept for White is demonstrated by the attacking genius John Littlewood in this game.) 7...Qb6 8.c4!? Nxd4 9.cxd5! exd5? (9...Nxf3+ was essential - Littlewood) 10.Nxd4 Qxd4 11.e6! Qxa1 12.exd7+ Kd8 13.Re1 Nf6 14.Qe2 Kxd7 15.Bb2 Qxa2 16.Bb5+ Kc8 17.Rc1+ 1-0, J.E.Littlewood-Ellison, Chorley (England), 1991.

d) 5...b6 needs more investigation: 6.Bb5+ Bd7 7.Bd3 Nc6 8.O-O Nge7 9.Nbd2 Ng6 10.g3 Be7 11.h4 O-O 12.Nb3 a5 13.Be3 f5 14.exf6 gxf6 15.h5 Nh8 16.Bh6 Re8 17.Ne5 Nxe5 18.dxe5 f5 19.Bxf5 exf5 20.Qxd5+ Nf7 21.e6 Bxe6 22.Qxe6 Bf6 23.Qxf5 Nxh6 24.Qf4 Bxa1 25.Rxa1 Nf7 26.Nd4 Qg5 27.Qf3 0-1, Rahls-Hodgson, Biel open, 1992.

**1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.e5 c5 4.b4 cxb4 5.d4 Bd7**

White must now choose between two possibilities, both insufficiently explored to date.

**6.a3**

Or 6.Bd3 Ne7 7.a3 Nbc6 8.axb4 Nxb4 9.Be2 Nf5 10.c3 Nc6 11.h4 a6 12.g4?! Nfe7 13.h5 h6 14.Nh4 Na7 15.f4 Nec8 16.g5 Nb6 and Black was well on top in Barendregt-Bronstein, EU tch, Hamburg 1965. This is the only example of 5.d4 cited in ECO but it is not conclusive.<level start="5.d4"/>

White cannot get an attack by pawn moves alone so 12.g4 was probably wrong. He should either castle at move 12 or then play Rh3 and possibly next Nh2 before deciding how to tackle the f5-knight.

**6...Qa5! 7.Bd3 Bb5!**

This is a hard line for White to play.

A game between two future GMs, Day-Huebner, World Junior Ch 1967, continued with the unsuccessful exchange sac 8.axb4?! Qxa1 9.Bxb5+ Nc6 10.Bd2 Qb2 11.c3 a5 12.O-O axb4 13.c4 Nge7 14.Ng5 h6 15.cxd5 hxg5 16.dxc6 bxc6 17.Qf3 Rc8 and 0-1, 29. This game raises more questions than it answers.
