6c565a06-1618-4475-89b6-4abbcb7199f6|That's five to eight years in federal prison.
d8bcbb81-1bfe-40c7-928b-f2ed6f7bf6ce|He opened fire on federal agents.
eba5bd34-bad9-442a-aee5-2359b8855e6d|We have federal agents on site.
7caa1232-7613-497d-8199-4a62ebd601bc|This is a federal matter now.
57917377-257a-486e-9525-b592f570144f|She broke up with him, first day of school.
8eafb6f9-b910-4aef-92c5-09030db5b5cc|It broke my heart to go.
989de661-38ce-4cb7-870c-b82a34631ba3|I think I can break through it.
a185528b-8ea3-4e5f-93d3-16f93e2660a9|It could be breaking down into something else.
68614660-04cd-45b4-b3c7-769b55d59075|Simon's actions are proof of this.
2a7603de-6c4e-46d7-831a-a6a9d5fa97d2|Everything's moving real fast with this class action.
6ba24012-fd93-40f7-b947-be30bdf7902b|That we would take action so soon.
98e687f5-6175-4366-b847-9239ae5e7e5c|Get in on what action?
1809c2a7-dc47-4202-9192-25bc48d1bb60|Robert, you'd better soon decide where your values lie.
a31ba867-0e56-4f36-880c-15cff48754ae|You said that my values are normal.
1b6f9195-ed6a-47a0-b07b-aed93437cf81|Thank you very much for having me.
e67cafa5-25d8-44ae-9e37-c44247bb2abe|You should thank your father.
72db6d16-3cbd-4c4b-8bc8-6842421f1f83|Thank you for getting us here, together.
6e84f4c8-14d2-42fa-b5be-d5264fccd356|Yeah, yeah, thank you, but no.
2192f305-6254-4d69-9989-60dc72babed0|I really just wanted to say thank you.
85905a0a-ed9b-4ead-aed1-d47193857753|Yes, yes, yes, thank you very much.
60762dd4-e4a1-4642-8288-4c1e45b8762a|Well, I did my job, thank you.
62c7845a-4ea1-49c6-898e-6b343750097e|He's staying on in town.
7c218494-2b6d-43fa-902b-efbcf35eedae|He heard she was back in town.
300e5772-2c13-45dd-a5d3-bf7c43221b87|My husband has been out of town.
2432851c-7e74-4cc5-bd8b-849b88b8223c|Oh, he went to town on that thing.
e0f617b3-29ca-4bf0-9c1f-63afd30ef04b|And I want to make it even better.
e5fa43cd-a0fe-4533-a7e0-74795a08f530|Yes, and you look much better.
613e53e0-79ec-48bd-a607-282decb99eec|There's nothing you can do to make it better.
09ff2f16-34b7-497f-b8ac-ddfd1e931988|Exactly where in the building are you?
311d8592-d45f-4812-9caf-57d3251ec990|I mean, outside my apartment building.
b64367c6-3409-4576-a832-6384a827a2aa|We knew this building had problems.
e3c245eb-6131-4b93-aefa-ac4d8dff59b5|We bought a building to live in together.
d5b66ff6-fe98-4d31-a903-18cce5cac17d|No, it's on the top of that building.
d7d6660a-4de5-42ec-850b-1f1fc8d86aa5|I only received it yesterday.
44709630-0a9d-479e-b531-9e1f42844378|About a month ago, I received this letter.
75c97ab4-d66c-4f07-b83a-9a84c2b7a7c3|I received a call that said they were hurt.
ee5b60f0-36f4-44a4-9ab0-7eea0bb9db54|We knew that we would be very received.
5ec49586-ba2f-48cc-9087-c0d716765d46|Stop caring too much about the society.
242a43ca-e455-4a6e-8662-889e7edda319|Why do you even read the society pages?
95aaac99-c880-4050-8bdf-3a7cb6ffde17|All of society, from highest to low.
7ed47dab-e726-40b6-b4c2-486950dc0964|Enemies of society, it says in the papers.
e7a31fc6-d1d6-4a35-9edd-494dd05f2f42|Although there is one difference between you and me.
65b6dfda-be5b-4ae7-8684-520906caf999|I'm glad to see you know the difference.
5d79363d-0cb7-44f1-bcdf-0d02e57384d9|I mean, I'm the leader of a church.
7d113acb-7860-4195-9ce3-37864e50b4b2|I can't take her to church.
5b5a3020-b62a-4c4b-8bb8-52e709087deb|Why don't you bring him to church on Sunday?
35cce3b3-8805-4a6c-a503-7d2abfc2b5cd|Okay, we've got a full house, people.
c3b49b90-0a66-4eec-bec9-6db76d8d9d0e|I've had my hands full with this.
4fc475ee-121c-412a-9a93-d65a0c7bab66|This place used to be full of people.
d908cc3f-67de-4da5-92ed-ff7f9424670a|Well, you think you can handle a full order?
aee3ffd5-db9a-4949-8d16-7a50795adb85|Anyone ever tell you you're full of it?
9d1ced0f-260e-4d87-82e2-755365efb63a|Or make them join you.
d447de2c-22ec-4020-aadd-03a217dae6c2|He will need our children to join the fight.
acc8e66b-36c3-46ae-b86c-c2b887932efa|We may not be long joining them.
88df5fd6-4fe0-4253-9d34-5697625b50a8|I'll put her in the road.
b2ac2db8-370b-4e08-ab12-5b07fa8274f5|You really want to go down this road?
27565381-6bb7-4135-ab29-6da0d8f13a3e|It would have been a long road alone.
6d23cbcc-03aa-4365-8381-357d18270042|I found you on the road.
00f9773e-bc1a-4f9f-b328-780a566a65c3|Is that part of your business model as well?
e8caab8d-a3d7-455d-a9e8-4dc4c64342b0|Doesn't he know that he's the model today?
439b58dd-1a00-4df1-973d-1095387f6c99|You're the role model for her, not me.
1d0b907d-f3ba-4b1e-98c4-d1bab0f08225|They're the ones that put you in this position.
ff55f663-3f67-49ed-ad69-61ef969c7952|I just want to tell her about her position.
75ab7098-cf5a-4c43-a5be-874f2da69041|And I'll do your taxes.
78041235-15ad-4ccb-81a0-53514ab21e56|On top of that, you raised our taxes!
d3a456aa-9570-4b3f-901e-9ddc3f5b9ddf|They don't pay their taxes.
5f570a3b-5b48-470d-bea9-0e9076d86668|I'm, I'm, the director, I suppose.
0018b2c8-102d-4ce7-8343-831ea4208c9d|The director doesn't know much about such things.
b6a749af-a3f4-44d7-a6c2-442de2d71f90|Most directors are like that.
eec4b750-c92e-4350-8b96-d2dfc418ca3c|He went missing earlier this morning.
2f869b9a-16f6-4ecc-bb88-ad3cce76eddc|She keeps looking at me since earlier.
a314ca8d-7a41-43a9-a544-28f68055bf53|You know earlier when I said I miss David?
604007c8-006b-4d31-aec1-940bd1b16c1d|I see we agree on one thing already.
02f10f31-de3e-4eba-a2ef-a34d0cd22131|What do I tell him that he agrees?
04f5f4bb-e68d-4f59-9528-cbaa5a9f1a0e|And I'm actually beginning to agree with him.
cea85262-1cfc-4a4b-bdb1-9785f7caf7fe|I don't know if I agree with them.
c2b07794-55b0-4f96-964c-de2184c60528|I don't know if that matters to you?
689b9feb-d825-4ff9-ae2f-e9e316369564|I need to do something that matters.
f17da840-06c9-4089-816c-70f51d1bea7b|As a matter of fact, I was just leaving.
68dec76a-c570-40f0-a619-18aa0e948fa1|Couldn't take the chance, especially now.
2f80b698-8ccd-4ccf-8e1b-db52f94aa3cc|But I'll never tell anyone, especially not you.
1d3d7cf2-dd1b-4d56-ac94-ee1afcd93aaf|Especially after what she did for you.
f6f56d53-b31d-4ba3-9ec2-c1c8d54886cd|He got form, has he?
40557c0b-8c0c-4ca7-b756-11515790a203|Our old man -- he's losing that form.
b6376183-51f0-4f17-a5ef-4363e1b4f54b|Sir, this is the wrong form.
2f365232-2c3d-437b-953c-972b3c7022aa|Now, who needs help filling out the order forms?
61843c18-c4d8-4805-a3ef-053457315407|They will have their own record label.
7e8b0339-19d8-4048-a2fb-f32a6381a454|They won't take him if he's got a record.
6e1a5a45-b1b7-4013-a6e6-600c788c3a1c|You could play the record again, though.
46218695-8747-4632-ac8b-f39294dae366|I don't exactly have the best track record.
d031b4aa-fc6d-4c75-8752-80ed4537ec6a|I never go off the record.
19c453c5-e269-4bc0-8413-37d9a96c63f7|But I've asked if I can special order it.
04beda26-9ace-4b71-b116-1dd08d1907c3|I know how special that place is for you.
2e618d78-7e76-406d-a31b-dfa20575c8c5|I mean, I'm nothing special.
96798c5d-c119-45a7-a556-eca7fc03516a|Without it, what made him special is gone.
57321e0a-3aca-4aaa-9f5c-e8c7d3392bc3|They are what make you special.
de63c7ac-1f68-43be-a1c8-db4e05935580|They didn't want any of us off grounds.
3ce82c1c-9e0e-4362-827a-0c455bedcecb|Her feet didn't even touch the ground.
972a1819-18e2-43a0-9c10-ecd1037ac760|Whatever you do, don't go into the grounds.
979815ae-adea-4a58-9298-a2acd286076b|No, it's just she grounded me, you know?
6a2dd25c-5657-4383-9a11-5a7b915493eb|I told him I'm trying to stay grounded.
05ad84bb-e271-4e9c-be00-fc20ada958ca|You're this close to being grounded.
3934ab6f-a7e0-42d3-9561-20cd26cc9dec|I don't think you grounded yourself.
e6164ec6-5de7-4de6-98de-f77c0bce73bc|I thought I was grounded.
ff2c29df-58e1-4cc8-b3e4-79ec1c24043f|Whose body was in my house?
55539975-6860-45b7-a4fa-40a20107de95|Whose back have you been rubbing, Ray?
f843a07b-58c5-49fc-8d05-288bb26a526b|Whose stupid idea was that?
a17664fa-5daa-4131-a167-01187c3929e4|Whose side are you gonna choose this time, Jimmy?
3fc71792-8253-4dd3-849d-8f754043461e|Whose house is it, though?
aeef8258-3996-42b8-a670-137965719ff1|I don't know whose son I'm raising.
c37832d8-c790-4997-89dd-3835e3846f90|But you know whose fault that is?
3b6cec0b-b06e-4345-bc41-7483c8b15ea1|Do you know whose baby that is?
bb257b61-6e7a-4262-a07f-faa6652084ae|I'm sorry, whose side are you on?
ac807ce2-b787-4221-9409-dcf03f280bbc|It's probably just some student whose feelings I hurt.
115cae51-e999-42ba-b630-4e2bce2c87cd|Having a hard time getting here.
ab92e4a0-56de-489b-83a0-306f8f5c3d60|And we never used to try that hard.
bf8ec983-9baa-40db-809e-c0846d4e46ca|We'll just have to do this the hard way.
ac0fb939-2c2b-4d94-ab55-71280d14f73a|Jeez, he plays hard to get.
a9c0f45b-874a-438d-9b75-10c29b1455b7|Is that how older men pick up younger women?
f591348f-bbbe-476b-bd24-0f41a4067664|One picked him up two nights ago.
5c969dbf-e1a3-4f3c-9f86-8cbc750a5368|If he likes it, he'll pick up the phone.
1c488600-1f4f-40ea-9369-6e7a8b81672e|Why the hell did you pick me up?
b05fa83e-3beb-4cdf-bceb-521f56698baa|This was in last night's paper.
25d40d17-cc66-4843-a07d-47cd4cc755ee|You never needed that paper.
f05b1562-4ddb-4e75-a413-365c27b05491|She read it in the paper.
aafc1ecb-b495-4c16-93a5-f7979649d53f|I think we should call the papers, Johnny.
29d9b45c-db4c-43bc-ae2e-bcd232c794fc|Did you read that in the paper or something?
0cac22aa-b8ae-49e9-9f35-5c2260c65a2d|There's a public official, you know!
590f2dbb-43a5-485e-a821-4a16a845b701|A very high official in the government.
c1743685-e4fc-496b-94b9-f8a61e015963|Many city officials are my clients.
6ada0a57-59bd-4f6e-b569-c066d56089b0|So now we're gonna make things official.
0364800a-c6c4-4fc0-aeb9-ee8bc14c2404|High officials like you would never go there.
b50da126-8d9d-4c81-8460-f4532b2d99fe|But this game is taking place out of season.
a5b688a5-0646-4b8c-94b4-4fb885e87860|I need you focused during the season.
32fb4e7d-e7cd-4540-ba78-a6d2b515e6f8|You know what I love about season one?
ce7f575a-e9c2-4cfa-9783-31983574ed78|I wore it for you.
67d574ad-12b4-4c68-a509-afcd4463496f|Well, of course it's for men, I'm wearing it!
41d46fb2-c8c3-49b9-81f5-eefd57a65a0b|Well, she's wearing next to nothing.
4397d2d8-1fdf-4985-b841-c44887f7c068|Wear it well on your first day.
170eafc5-d50c-4410-ab5d-9c66a1ce7402|Are we really gonna let her wear this?
96f6f528-7829-44a6-9fbf-ac8dfa2b88ce|It means my death is a fixed event.
b8691feb-6e38-47ba-a04f-59cb4187e57e|Put down the events in your own words.
81fef547-dfe7-4d4a-9e30-607a8ac9f216|Everything she's saying is supported by the evidence.
06f8cc0c-87a1-46a2-a4c0-5f68b68d4255|But I should go to support you.
9b6852cd-3cca-48ea-a23b-6f891a7e36ea|I'm not asking you to support me.
4398f2d5-b672-400a-95a9-bef3dc9e2748|We really just don't have the space.
a7a0822d-e3f1-4ed4-9b68-a8b4c981562f|Maybe we should just give him his space.
a1037842-86f5-4019-9203-b633ec7b056b|I was born in space.
6bef7d7b-5e46-413c-9497-b89986459cce|The team could use a few good players, right?
c8b2ace9-0296-4c93-987b-22db51cf79b9|Keep up yourself, young player.
18546166-4fce-44a5-afba-9289365bd27e|I wanted to say it when everyone was here.
cb1bf57f-a4c5-44d7-b036-d604bf593d09|Everyone's doing their best, Jack.
d69e0520-3fdc-4f25-93fa-3291a54661c2|We have to look after everyone.
58645baa-488d-41df-a25b-4ee66ef69a87|I'd want everyone to hear it.
0b6a4590-a923-497e-9070-baa724d107bb|What do you mean, like everyone else?
09177ef7-4828-4cc7-9e37-1e77fb5152ef|Shouldn't take more than a couple of hours.
3eac5d66-a18c-4c73-80d2-48e9ed801106|Well, we met her a couple days ago.
a832374b-70a1-40c9-9b91-3df8c878922c|I need something more than another couple to kill.
fb5fdd3c-134f-473f-bc46-4702bb23c0ea|Maybe in a couple of months or something.
6900b240-df96-4a68-a5ad-859a3a010b70|You know what we ended up giving them?
2f17b814-5e04-424c-ac39-589d157b9ad2|I'll end up alone here.
bfff7353-f96c-4508-b26f-d7e6f19dafbc|We ended up talking for hours like old times.
d2845d64-cca0-4fc8-a6d5-085044ce2b6d|You know, obviously, like, where I'm based.
04e3b562-8d92-4c96-ad83-9731d1f3b841|Based on what confidence are you trying so hard?
cb558a3e-de76-460f-bc65-cea96f19940e|But based on his symptoms, sugar is not enough.
c3cbfbd4-67ff-4af5-82bf-0a2508c91f2d|Based on the appearance of their feet?
a576d586-725b-41b1-9348-4f6cee1d861c|You know, we're talking about doing a project together.
b64673a2-9921-4911-aaa4-434d3c304fdf|First you tell me about that new project.
6e366da9-7d46-493b-a9ac-4723c099cd4a|Can you tell me about the arts center project?
2fcb861c-22ab-4dd4-9fa4-65ac8f581b7e|Can we all agree to do the family project?
8cea2f21-c461-4e50-afac-788b89538cdf|What kind of movies does your dad produce?
d3f8471f-9646-4c5c-8345-8a51c1d78626|We did this in a movie I just produced.
2530e988-eb5b-4a17-b102-a0199412d749|You produce this show, Call It Murder?
8edccfcd-cfa2-4cfd-a71a-5f69bf374659|He has no respect for people or produce.
f87a4860-044e-4174-80a4-7b52d4462dac|Maybe you shouldn't produce me.
8c7e8a0c-6244-4ab9-b794-8f1fa9e0e03d|He wanted to see the new site.
37b61e97-ab2c-459b-ad75-e07f1676db27|Do you know that site?
ccf5dd0c-9a11-460b-be26-3c3907f5b1e8|We need to talk to the other sites.
5393c543-d5bb-4b07-a6b4-64825489f640|Sir, the situation is under control.
c9305463-e397-4101-b8f7-4d31ecad3b1b|It's a situation you have to come.
52e02a55-b342-4761-be48-00b0dbcb8443|At least the situation is not too bad yet.
8eefdd63-092e-4cad-be2f-be00a4824e23|They can't hit us if we keep moving.
2b07e917-d413-4312-8d68-04c9bfce2030|You're not going to go hit on her?
6d0fbf49-ebf7-48b9-a882-de526858507b|No, he did not hit on me.
0536d5bd-168d-4f5d-bd82-7dafa3a71a86|I hit him too hard, didn't I?
52ab88af-7476-493d-a4be-21c4a88fd9f3|What are you gonna do, hit me?
39666108-0d09-4212-ad98-2126892202f0|There is talk among people in the industry.
76aeae7f-6cc1-4293-98b2-e0cce79f41eb|But there is no industry here.
c03fed2d-176f-4f84-84c3-84145a33bcdb|But it was half price.
43fd7a0f-acf1-4b08-8691-9cf55179299a|Half your clients are married.
377d3c32-c5ce-4738-9889-3d87148f8543|I want to talk to half moon.
7f969fc8-aee8-430d-964b-993e7a434429|Half past eight at the hotel.
e8689cbf-a282-4d70-932c-3371d373717f|Not half as sorry as you're gonna be.
b35d575c-70a5-420d-b5af-54f26d2ee2cb|I signed him out not half an hour ago.
c5e36154-fecb-4924-8bbb-8ffcd311e495|He's kept me here waiting for half an hour.
5a5a6a1b-5998-4cac-8932-256b5aebdcd5|You filled that half an hour ago.
fcbc4663-d760-4bb4-82c4-a04b632a7ef4|There are more interesting activities than art.
bac9ca7e-950b-45a5-89db-61112475d0df|There's no activity down by the site?
3c748f97-5bb9-4870-8379-473fd8368295|And this cop was later fired for his activities?
320e9414-dcee-4fe6-9aa5-2249f134374d|There's no activity from his cell phone.
ee30efac-fdcd-4891-a226-5c6b349de602|There is heavy activity on the other side.
4c1b36c4-f1f7-48cb-b597-48eb36bddbb9|They've been used for centuries by native americans.
2269b955-5b91-48e7-a7b8-1e58839712d1|They'd never seen Americans before.
714f6975-1897-4d3f-b02d-df00f3addadc|Come and eat with us before you go.
26a6295e-c5b7-4651-bc74-7bffd38414f1|Well, I could eat here, and there.
d1447d36-a608-4d6d-817e-e840d7dfd00a|Well, how else should it be eaten?
fb950c56-430a-433b-8bbb-694a4e73c1e4|Joe, she would want us to eat.
fd4fd814-5cdb-4134-a59d-1316668fcbf7|This place will pull you into itself.
fc92c1da-03e7-4308-933d-188205d23e28|I like the way this thing handles itself.
872fbdc7-6ee0-467c-a959-b2c9da6c647e|Go ahead, it wears itself out.
d633fa2e-7321-4a9b-b407-5f7d0dc46932|That ball isn't going to kick itself, is it?
c04995d9-ec75-4495-9e64-c314e94508a9|But your track record speaks for itself.
522770a1-70ab-45c8-8d33-13760d742262|From someone who no longer had need of it.
474c57ed-d19a-46af-bc8f-8b8e9863c7d0|Anyway, there's no need, I can work.
fa569648-a939-4c8b-bcd2-98e1695ffbac|There's no need to include her.
ac6df294-6805-4f12-b15b-2f5d51a0c4d6|Good, probably no need to call tomorrow then.
3c3a311f-eba7-4a93-9318-2237ba2fd944|You know, figure out her next move.
02be49f3-a155-497c-96ae-42bf8668c2da|I know you see me as a father figure.
540e6b41-cf5d-4019-9426-ce6ad879a527|As a public figure it is perhaps normal?
fc99bd91-e47e-444c-a642-52648f29aebb|Now we gotta figure this out.
199f906c-99b0-4c39-9377-b3cc400c5a1b|I know the cost of what I did.
0666dcda-846a-4f0c-97ed-97dd1d2a076c|Cost more to fix it than what it's worth.
a98818a5-bb03-4680-b4ef-62b05dc437ce|But working on this game cost me my marriage.
cdb97fdb-c37f-4a77-9f27-0315bb312f40|And this is how much each of them costs.
ef04e716-3bfa-4d89-917e-e76a6b0b983a|No matter what cause, no matter what cost.
c8bcd15d-0b9d-4ab5-928d-1965fd5690a4|It has not always been easy for me.
6838bfd3-9ec6-45a4-8f50-f3b7ade86e1b|I wish I could say that it gets easier.
4b782056-f65c-4aff-bcbb-6767619937a8|You guys make it look easy.
584dd320-71e4-4ab4-81da-76a701bbf878|That's pretty good, so you've actually quite interesting cars.
b563da83-5073-4151-9ba5-cefc59927d31|You're quite mad, my boy.
4ebef19a-aff2-4980-a40b-f526f59e9fa0|Never quite felt Like sticking around to find out.
bd5a840e-8e8a-468f-8520-30d567e5109c|You must face this man.
ab07100f-c11b-4432-b68b-be485ea0de97|It's no fun facing this on your own.
73d7755c-ca4b-409b-8b0c-d697de7b1714|You'll notice we have some new faces here.
b66d7e90-7946-45a6-8fb3-318d3c379bdd|Take a picture, why don't you?
810299f5-7d05-492a-9d9f-900eb0dd39bb|Why is he holding on to this girl's picture?
99157654-36cc-4b48-996a-0329a44ce24f|You're not my friends anymore, clear?
336a16f7-e96f-4784-982b-e68069998f40|How can I help clear things up?
d648cdc2-b054-4a9a-ae8f-acab284621b5|He was very clear about that.
063f8343-41b1-40d3-97b0-179fe1769821|I'll cover for you, honey.
698a7e82-a05f-498e-8ad0-d6a0083c2465|What if she blows your cover?
dfe85166-28f2-44ed-9fdd-3d400e580310|And she's also the first one he covered up.
bce4e62b-8b30-4c20-9887-9b01f8a8ef60|His cover was blown, he's gone.
da9ebb56-cfe9-4d79-9d99-312792321ad0|I don't know how you describe it.
5a8256c3-36bb-427a-8da1-767f32691890|I can't really describe it.
a0799db5-e1ee-4583-a3f5-0a23f28f7587|I can't describe how great it is to win.
ee3c563e-70e5-4624-88c7-1a5f57c81ef8|This is how I would describe the hole.
347cf301-ab05-4670-9bb3-57feda1f3a2b|She described the support system you were building.
024367c0-097f-4a08-806c-58b89ad99a27|You know, it's important to control your public image.
91cd1037-7534-4d45-8a2a-d775348b9d80|And what would you know about image?
d9bdfaa6-5467-49b5-a28e-080b1927e463|It can be a sound, an image, a memory.
deb861f2-cf8f-400d-9173-87a7e2feb890|Hardly the image we've come to expect, is it?
9187e676-e3af-4fb5-a5da-6af7455528e7|There's so much I got to teach you.
5805cefc-2567-4abf-9585-8417ca397a39|That's exactly what I'm trying to teach you.
fb3551a6-6804-438c-823b-f33544d4d6b6|He'll teach you what you need to know.
fcb382c1-3185-42e8-ba66-b4bf1f08f56e|Well, how's he gonna teach you to do that?
901e7d16-835f-4696-9c56-1b55a31bc828|Would you teach me to shoot?
8f6edcc1-7ab3-4874-807f-978183f16899|Why has he got my picture on the wall?
47eedf6e-0f21-4020-baca-f5148c15cc0a|He shouldn't be outside the walls.
08653d71-cc15-48b1-aeca-26f091359add|Maybe you can see through walls.
e2109b3a-4028-4d2e-901e-ae697203434d|I could hear them through my wall.
e662067b-7ea8-4c6f-b07d-b36eef708aab|I must send for the doctor now, I must!
27e1abb3-c96d-4e95-8e0d-36f62ecbacdd|What kind of doctors are you?
7026c157-403e-4862-ba1f-ec2b38248b34|America needs more family doctors.
8b069266-7d99-430e-be5c-72ebc58bb34a|They pay their doctors less.
a76e9423-b771-41f9-a1b0-2daa7cb165fa|Ken, check out all recent reported shootings.
08351c69-a3a4-4a1f-852f-3e1cdcc9bd67|Before the recent trouble, he did.
b55cc5c3-098b-41b7-b442-801607353aaf|Recent memories can be useful.
6c1b7485-f952-4613-abbe-c892bb51b3b8|How recent was this time you spent together?
f08999d8-b801-4ac0-8ada-b132640340de|The most recent was only two weeks ago.
e51cd49d-37b6-4883-b077-600ccac9dbc1|I'd like to take a look at the product.
2877fafe-39b0-499d-914d-c566dfe8fe1b|Until then, no one gets product.
5ce6e2bb-970c-47c1-a3e5-c8057c9c1da0|And I'll know just how good his product is.
0f553ed7-a2ac-49a0-a437-9dd2e7ec2c98|What if I deal out all of the product?
035aa0bd-4a21-4441-9626-789013cbd14b|Who has access to the company's data?
62f2e9d0-a326-42ac-85db-bc46c7f6128c|That's a large pool of data to draw from.
64c4d414-7bcd-4685-aa6d-75a6cceec4e7|I'll bet you just need a little practice.
c2a0bcde-0c7e-4f90-96e8-959d90feb4cd|Yes, but I have to practice on you.
9fe8fe06-27c2-414a-a8af-e8423fac752e|I want you to take over my practice.
9170e156-d2d3-4dda-bb85-2a5b0b8c0e7b|He had to give up his accounting practice.
3970ca86-8012-415a-8237-d75e475ecf61|How many times did you practice that song?
73f046b7-d947-4c85-b912-c6f456cfe1f0|We turned off your phones, didn't we?
c375cc53-2379-4b19-8054-64e531d56e3e|Why don't you phone down for a table?
9fb3de15-69b9-49f2-9085-ed0904700411|You have a phone in every office?
01be165a-a74b-43dd-8ec1-bbc166ec310a|I never liked those pieces anyway.
bf8ff88b-413f-44a7-b260-8cabbf301ae9|But I -- you know, one piece of advice.
be79b114-5e71-4bf4-89df-2e2d18a6823d|At least it's in one piece.
c4cbeea8-384f-4c76-9f82-fc120607a194|You got all your pieces?
526ac89c-7b6d-4e11-9cf5-17239cfe1d5b|That doesn't mean in one piece.
5838077f-0491-46b1-86f7-3dd728497314|She is one, yes, but nothing is certain.
9d63dc62-772f-4f98-b73e-0b98d4b701d2|I'm not saying that I know for certain.
8d263058-e341-423d-ab7c-e43723771ce4|No, I didn't like that at all either!
ebf9cac6-21d0-482a-b708-123adb6a414e|Then we won't either, will we?
437bdc5b-e13f-44cb-89d0-622e9e5f41d7|No one likes me either.
234b8f2b-4ba5-439e-a848-dc6d0c15de19|But Ken doesn't like us either.
770d96c3-9a8f-4ba9-b722-0f7f319f9e9e|This wasn't working for me either.
396699b2-7261-4fdd-9ea6-e3692617f202|This is more oil than potato.
da8b6935-655e-43d1-8639-a2f442718f69|What if there's no oil there?
a7f741b0-d823-4bc8-9a74-f7b6ab8874b2|I am simply reminding you of the risks.
8743cd5e-5121-44a1-93b4-6c5345d9e870|I simply refuse to believe it.
6dd004b1-4ae7-4405-8e4c-00444ef66f27|I simply want to put this behind us.
df749284-5cd9-4672-bee8-baf7eebc23d5|They made me take a second test.
e3318f81-cea4-4887-b436-36675bc415b3|Your test results have just come back.
4e443411-0b69-4a4e-945b-df1ef1ab3f43|Let me give you an eye test first.
bd96cd9b-0564-455a-9695-a116cf88282d|When do your test results get back?
1fd480c0-4ad3-40c5-8ee8-abe32aed9b18|People don't get personal with you.
0b2248d6-25f4-4698-926c-ca65afca11d4|It was a personal ask from him.
263eebf2-2551-46fd-a8a5-c4099dea0cfb|I would like to ask you something personal.
724ac57f-b995-4b2b-a5df-b25837c7d9c0|For personal reasons, our teacher needed some time off.
5009f4a7-88e4-400c-8d9a-386c5d613ca7|You just dropped in from the stars.
4b044346-513b-4a66-8156-f9cfd27cf169|I believe certain things are written in the stars.
5d816d6b-e4ed-4ce4-bda4-7afea59fc139|I came out here to be a movie star.
7c50b010-b5ce-4772-a014-49b469e03cec|You looked like a movie star.
dcc3e9f9-6e0e-4979-be75-5bc082c60896|This is their land now.
bf7a90c1-57d0-4bfb-b7d8-b34e378d4c44|He'll land up in court before long.
716dfbf3-3fe6-4988-bd4d-72b327cdfe37|What if I were to buy this land?
91f505c1-0711-4349-a242-6c1924ed0a08|I wouldn't mind a third eye, would you?
fe1f19e5-4e77-4b3c-9da8-e1a20c6913d9|Except for last year when we got third.
f8ee0196-e431-4d28-841e-112f55a21f01|We only do that every third month.
5dcdf414-bc23-4b3a-99e8-27a3137f3f5c|She's the third one from the door!
5d09d425-33ee-4423-a360-f7649945791d|This here is our general store.
17bd4125-dd18-4085-9fbc-8319ead5034f|I was thinking about life in general.
66fe1756-7824-4fb8-8293-2c419f6b3d73|Why does any man do anything, general?
bdebcc3f-3f86-4657-a9f1-ff960eaf2421|Ray, when can I get some computer time?
0000edb4-0044-41b6-b494-ab78ecaa3e4f|They should use that computer box.
c29477ed-c145-4e55-8206-a8d17270c4e8|His watch, his cell, and his computer were stolen.
5ed4e679-b88f-4279-9659-c0727ead5326|I think you watch too many movies.
71c6e984-3917-4cdf-b164-897f0ed16bd7|You really need to finish that movie.
26123dfe-5a3d-4d2e-978e-06abc60998b6|My father was a government worker.
6fbe7bb2-de2c-48a3-8e9a-994cdb6d429a|You're not my social worker anymore.
dc7d8827-a57a-4cc3-883a-b12812d62cd1|We should do this in the open.
7b72beb8-92ae-4437-8598-914e87b7456f|I'm gonna go open it in my room.
f8271008-20a1-40ac-b5b6-0a4d73d1a40b|I need that cell open.
9bcb2785-a496-4d29-bdef-4290d545dc1a|Well, actually, the open house is tomorrow.
e8e76ae9-d8c9-4dfe-bae7-ebd52a25af0c|If it's in the open, they'll cut it.
d6acfa02-393e-42cf-b63c-736621c755c4|I caught it from here.
22abef77-e5b0-4b93-bb07-5dfb1ccd39cf|It can't be to just catch up.
1bf6be94-e7b5-4efc-b220-57e791c32e10|What, to try and catch me doing something wrong?
01b6fddb-ed42-42df-ab35-8808acc2fa22|You want to get us caught?
b60fd50f-82eb-48ee-a6d5-bc6018d8884c|How's a person change his blood type?
871f9ded-2bcf-4aec-90e8-0a56f8ef8ae4|Yeah, well, who'd you sell that type to?
5413c436-7b3e-4503-b236-76f766757579|That the type of person she is.
e37fab28-61f4-4735-8aec-6da4dcdc3600|They're bringing a lot of support for our cause.
89a44682-c20d-420c-9968-8a0e245348dd|At the very least, I expected your support.
3a9a3eed-6a3c-4c1f-8083-3311fbe102cc|You'll be staying in the north wing.
6805792c-e265-4abd-8d16-292e8fead80e|And I'll come in from the north.
ec5b0517-ece7-499e-8da2-7fa2a87268c4|You were right about that north face.
06630f6f-9345-4887-b2a3-1924f2abf151|Well, it's the love between you that matters.
3d8cae7c-284d-4914-9f5c-5190a2b16923|She fell in love with me, man.
e8522284-44a6-458e-95bd-f15016d477f0|I'm not saying she's in love with him.
34e47f9f-2bea-463c-89f2-cf9466b5650d|Yes, my love, I'll come right away.
6afd2449-1275-41e3-bdd3-f9c7d52457b0|You were in love for the first time.
53db02bf-05d4-469b-b196-d48e8ed455b1|Then why don't we start with a small step?
ab53d551-705e-4011-8ac0-bf83ab5c1d16|At that point, call me for step two.
502b8915-643b-4cb8-82a1-a0d4920c5e24|This is a big step for me, too.
50cd3820-50d5-4ce2-96a0-20a5896e0a52|Take another step and I will shoot.
7c60c638-30fb-4196-b450-2b181bfd8d14|I think I need medical attention.
a9ac850d-f39f-4bb2-a8c4-5a935740ba95|Sir, do you need medical attention?
dfa75a3e-ee6e-4b76-b140-63cc43a3cf47|There's a lot more attention being paid.
99a1c6be-c7b6-4f99-8893-b829e087fac3|Of anyone who paid attention to her.
9424175e-7095-440e-b6e2-f830a6a5cfad|Come on, boys, attention, let's see.
3d88b8da-8c36-44c3-a40e-2468f69a534b|I had a baby four months ago.
759a3e75-7faa-4487-8e2f-654e5bf9a2dd|And now for baby number two.
d842ab12-577a-429a-8eff-17f8263cf6ed|My baby will be here soon.
db81300e-6768-4aa1-84b2-281c18b23b9c|I heard back from my sources.
695a94f4-a8cb-4d6b-b0bd-7a87e5c55dfa|Will you tell us anything else about the source?
00088c9f-8152-4a6f-ada5-a7d415939a8e|That is why it won't draw.
6a17eafb-bb3d-4526-823e-775f357c8460|Have you drawn on him?
d4d819b5-35e1-408f-8f32-fd65d6b35226|I was so drawn to you.
f4ae374d-288f-4fd2-bb04-56c1e88b69b6|The little girl, she drew this.
e973f1df-26db-4a56-a46f-3ff8004e9079|You got to figure out what's causing this.
ccfc6dd7-0d74-4de3-aade-9c192b73d9b8|You've caused enough problems for me!
390a7e13-3627-42dd-9f42-8788d602d145|I'm sorry for all the troubles I've caused you!
4741203d-2837-4bc3-9fbd-78852f2d22f2|I don't want to cause another scene here.
bc06bb61-32b6-477b-9976-d8450d146f45|This the big tree down by the church?
b70c389b-2a88-4270-b4a6-6a5e8da8bd5f|I hit a tree, that's all.
b0952219-8608-4506-85f1-a96a982348fa|What, you have something against trees?
9d39f1d9-03ec-42db-be33-3340335306e6|With a dead body under the tree.
36ddf5b8-79c4-4435-a6ce-7401ce74e103|I just need to head for that tree!
2f3d3685-5e48-4a08-b7ce-5091f94f2e7c|How did you get your film so fast?
066a1d53-932e-4a71-b21d-347cb53fcd7f|But first we need the rest of that film.
f2ec002b-d214-4a75-b3ed-5f44f458d919|This is his last film, he's retiring.
049783e2-35c1-482b-9a5b-ea0a4461cc52|Come on, the film is about to start.
e161d8cb-f5e1-4f33-aaf8-9d3067dcf140|And this time, I choose not.
3c4edb9b-66d7-4f9f-ae7b-f3ff42c15bca|Your husband chose to hand them over.
9b0cef08-27b3-4e0b-8797-4f0955443201|Wouldn't there be an evidence file?
efe8afc0-ab82-49ea-b1e8-e0ac6f6c0035|I was just following the evidence.
4b16c46d-c1ef-4d7a-82f4-c1c43f2d86e7|What evidence do you have that he cares?
2a4ec376-4c93-417b-8389-c6da39e9fd67|We can help with all these difficult feelings.
e9dd5151-e547-45e1-bc4d-18afd7b17561|I know it's been really difficult.
8cf8e1a2-1b53-4a80-99cd-a16aff2e416f|Getting to him before they do could prove difficult.
92a37a6a-81f3-4577-a678-ef308606da27|I can make your life very difficult.
f2c3b4ec-cc2a-483a-89f6-18495cdf7307|For centuries, this man knew me better than anyone.
33a59869-e395-424e-b0be-4dc330b387e1|She passed over a long time ago, centuries.
ba7fd508-0707-4199-bc1e-79276063829a|I mean, this has been going on for centuries.
9c12b3e5-3a80-46ac-92b0-4b7b84375a7e|I haven't done for nearly nine years now.
be07a09f-820f-420e-87d6-dc4fe63f4957|We nearly had it, boys.
83bd2dee-cc51-470b-b9f6-8e08d06617c2|It's been nearly six years.
4a1467ae-bbab-4daf-aa17-58a3ba17ba4e|The red doors, someone has to get them open.
2f01538e-3e90-4493-ab78-ad02ca17f298|When I do that it goes all red.
92dc0f6d-f74b-4990-ac71-9f2f61c14e57|Got it all figured out, do you, red?
cdcb2c72-2f1c-4b73-8610-f16234758d24|I didn't want to deal with their red tape!
a00ea825-243a-4edc-8909-175dd680dab9|Did you get a good look at them?
3fbb3209-d532-403e-9c41-9cc412d0ef33|I thought I might take a look.
a831e433-9546-4357-ae66-dd304f26733b|No, look, you were right.
a28b4bb0-56e8-41e4-8aaf-26bf357dbebd|Looks we weren't the first kids up here.
184dbfa3-4afa-4035-9689-225fb3cab9d9|Looks like she's not that into him.
1596cf9f-273e-49f0-aef4-f5c2e3945989|Did I need that pointed out for me?
5bfc6ea8-d731-40e3-b47a-820750e66a6a|Things are definitely pointing in that direction.
efa52646-5ed6-45fd-936f-aef83ca9b593|And he pointed it at me.
8d36260e-5f0e-4ff1-a9ca-55e64b712225|Anything that could point me in a direction?
8471df0e-1357-4c27-8ea4-45640c7ab3e5|And why are you coming through the window?
2e5ba6d3-af40-46a4-9c6f-d2068ed4d9e1|And I'd be happy to pay for your window.
0a8d70d6-1447-4f28-9646-76dfb23130e3|Now you have to open the window.
6d3d32c7-db08-455b-8ccd-3baeda7e98b1|Something just flew by the window!
879abf2d-4a59-4a94-9c0f-13daa1228455|We had to get through a window.
805813bf-3258-4dcd-8233-f3d816a3c70a|You mean, like at parks and schools?
b99e5e3e-8218-4008-9919-d4e145585834|Jenny came in from the parking lot between shows.
f055e710-5a7c-495a-80ef-000c9efd46fe|I'll see if they're still in the park.
e561a6f6-3f5f-47a4-b1b9-c63b9960a4f5|What do they think they're doing during study period?
e8f82a16-9a72-4c49-941e-eedb26691885|It's his rest period, sir.
91dfb18e-67de-4a62-bec3-267408606aa0|Because Felix didn't do drugs, period.
96df7491-4fe3-4792-ad4f-a433aabc37cf|I hope he's on a trial period?
a01893ec-ed1e-4edc-ae9f-1c8d051543ca|If you seek culture, visit a museum.
1fd77c07-8309-496e-9fad-fc9b0c86a725|Making love is a crime in your culture?
058f0d0c-f876-4188-85a9-7ff967415b61|I'd like to do this culture thing too.
0db3ee91-3d1f-44b7-9f27-cf4fa82a1bbb|Get your hair caught in the car door?
01230f80-1bbf-4daa-b2b5-18667ac36c3e|Oh, well, we'll get out of you guys' hair.
281db7fd-7a7a-4020-a176-8a65c4729b04|Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?
c84c0a2c-6434-4a89-aea2-40443427a803|What's that thing in your hair?
d07922aa-70db-49bf-b362-1cf50d3cc3d9|See, first, all your hair falls out.
3f5bdc06-e5a9-4cd5-b9ae-1a3e5519bb33|Since when did you start listening to me?
3b6fbe0d-96b0-43a8-9ff0-ed255ccf19c4|I'm just gonna take a listen to your heart.
29b5c590-42b0-4b32-98ee-acafe8a0e682|Listen, we're working on your Tony problem.
6a3356fb-fb6e-41dc-b5e2-6ba56f31ec50|You know when I would've listened to you?
255b224b-ba61-4a71-b9cc-72cc783088f5|I saw my chance to get out of here.
e1c4e661-f0b6-46c6-a339-17c989e1e8ad|On the chance that they might have it.
f587c038-bb05-4736-bce3-5f116ea2ec8b|I gave her a chance to make things right.
af1e7384-7082-46e9-ad08-693f6544de9d|He does this every chance he gets.
f4b7ff99-bb2f-41d7-9152-36b5f918d6ee|But just now, you lost that chance.
94006771-585f-4a47-a7da-40a1f006f2c5|It must be available somewhere.
8ab02799-3ec0-433a-924c-cf24b844ebae|I have other available lots!
f1353ce6-77df-4fbd-8546-a76d8f19cb4a|I think a room just became available.
919d6a7c-bbc8-49c6-9bd0-fad3c9f6f92f|I told him you weren't available.
06f6c67b-3cba-439e-8a97-65436c394088|Well, brother, it's right this time.
59f67b54-6dd5-4037-aad2-15dcc54e59f3|This guy my brother works for.
fba951d6-d0d8-48bf-849c-81e29f90fc8b|You know how brothers are.
a2d00fe9-893e-4713-b33c-927110621e0d|Your brother is becoming your sister.
67d9fd65-23ac-4256-a276-c32d961395c7|My brother could help you out.
ea6d1c02-5ee4-4c49-b953-587a81206d8f|She's back from her summer vacation.
638c46fd-cebd-4860-9a47-b86884a4946e|I want to stay here for the summer.
9404113c-d12a-40ca-a0ba-e3bd50dc92a6|It's getting hotter as we move into summer.
5149061c-8ba0-4e12-903b-c28740525c32|Don't you realize what you are doing?
1a3f02b5-ef0d-46c2-8ee8-dcb76812a254|You realize how difficult that is?
8996c1c4-edd0-4987-be50-0b3555adaa62|I have since realized I made a mistake.
10419dee-a4e7-495a-8e0c-484a9f6fd199|I didn't realize I had a problem with you.
f866a08c-2e59-4fa5-912b-c781b85508db|Do you realize how important that could be?
07fe6943-b5cb-4066-b137-99723193e77f|But they could come from a private source.
31c3e1be-eb35-419b-bcdc-b65c1c2b1c79|How old are you, private?
27b0f023-a96f-4db9-9017-238b85f92cd4|I prefer to play with myself in private.
66f0522f-671d-47d7-a19b-e5737b5c6f9a|They no longer have a use.
1c6be0e8-e3da-427e-a532-d2ba41b063d6|No, no, no, I'll stay here.
1b512aa8-a085-4437-91d5-924b9d7b565e|I no longer know what to do to help.
1425d8af-08d4-45e1-828b-0fabaffdf4f5|There's no after after this.
64cda41a-c518-4a1f-baca-d356616e55de|No, no, I got it, Lois.
2625e57e-9435-412b-bdcc-aaa83192dcfd|I'm in it for the science.
5d66d1ab-e516-42a2-8f53-62476b2c7179|You have to with the social sciences.
44e5c5cd-8593-4079-b1bc-1bde03823186|Only science can do that.
9b3a2de3-f6e1-45fc-800d-7e0ad3e371f0|And you make me laugh with your science.
a8c829a4-dc4c-4210-8dea-5ad1232ccacb|I have followed your orders to the letter.
df6f8ab2-1905-4543-80a3-82b44c0bb5b7|No letter was in her room.
50221a63-2cf9-46da-8204-b5fd79158f14|This is way too many letters, man.
0b3fa9e6-2d0a-4979-ae76-7cf7020b5ad2|They are sending us to the annual congress.
62d0eac9-e0e5-4f3f-adf4-56096ea8f8de|Did congress force the teachers to go on strike?
c8cec009-1a75-482d-9bc1-2de4bd18b05b|Does congress know about this yet?
7f72ea75-76eb-43a2-ba17-d15ace33f3a5|I still have a few friends in congress.
88b7a6a2-e0f9-46f4-8e9d-611cb3840ff0|You don't know anything about my condition.
c53029a5-b525-48fb-8fbf-49115e1e9272|Where on earth did you go in such condition?
afeda938-eaa3-4851-9f66-c8421dde60c1|What condition he was in, if he said anything.
1d90571d-d666-4fe8-b32a-fcf79beb9d32|Who flies in for that short a stay?
11578aa9-61ae-497a-a219-fe552817db49|He said Berlin's opening up a short window.
ef420a84-eb3c-4202-ab5d-b01762afc023|It's time to cut your long game short.
cd1b7248-4935-4949-97f6-38918ae7e956|Just keep your answers short and on point.
91fe6320-6d99-4373-8af3-7c391683b040|Place like this is likely full of them.
35c147a4-a249-4894-957b-03e564490465|It's not likely, I mean, her hair was cut.
aaadc1ba-36c3-43d0-9ce3-0ef541534456|Do you think you're likely to?
97ba94ec-e6b2-423a-8386-64a41cea673f|How likely is it you'll find his body now?
c510b7c0-f4cc-416c-9b64-352e4f65b70a|But we have to set some ground rules.
2aaf3353-594b-4f9c-a4d3-cfe3d57de5b2|This is my house, my rules.
375fa73d-8c9b-40a0-b57d-806d6bd1a958|These are your rules, by the way.
d8eb82f8-ed48-4864-ad85-a0fbd434ad75|My father Harry taught me a few simple rules.
5e703823-edfe-47bc-9790-fc6d067f8192|A woman who has made a choice.
c92c973b-9b0e-4a70-b5a9-a517ff628773|I don't see how we have another choice.
b5c34b0f-ea47-4c12-8a68-b445772e7ce9|I'm afraid we've been given little choice.
e7cc852f-0bf3-46d4-815a-206d3f40dc8c|I don't think he has a choice.
a09f9bf5-da66-44ec-ad16-13e6c59c7e4e|Maybe you're meant to be single.
81df0298-470f-4c3b-b291-31e742079118|There's no way of knowing who placed it.
96f025ce-9b80-47f7-85dc-9f6530a3e7a0|The People place this video tape in evidence.
ee60fc06-72ba-4c5f-a505-45c9c36c0f09|I still can't place him.
39195be2-d036-4c24-8a5d-567ef413a46c|Tell me where to place it.
10d91735-89e5-43cb-89cf-863f2acc77f4|To place it in the hole above your head.
04d105a9-cb43-4acf-bb92-22090f52278f|Remember your first patient was a horse?
d70255be-c433-4138-8d3e-c05a4fc6a65d|You want to catch the patient off guard.
69472687-76d8-4544-99a2-5a6644b2bc7a|I mean, I've seen it before with patients.
cbe2d8a1-e8f9-4408-873b-5a9ff08c66d0|That's what one of patients told me.
97db6567-834e-449a-87ee-97b33e50d275|Then get his patient bag.
8a9ba058-6728-4367-9e92-84b0ea37e8a5|What floor is he on?
83edfd43-8cfb-482e-bd0b-2cc623d30906|I looked at the floor, there is not.
48cd247a-55a7-4c13-ae9f-c50831e1de31|I'd like it even better on the floor.
e725ca2a-f7e2-4259-a3cb-44381f93e080|It's not being done on your terms.
8f50c062-ae85-47ff-bb9f-40918a5f7624|He'd rather die than agree to such terms.
be85c5ab-adf6-4774-851a-2ef318225714|Going over the materials in your mom's case.
b5549a4a-b50d-4568-ad02-fb3f5e33ff57|And I needed to work on some new material.
587c0286-ecba-4c8d-994e-95850947d9db|I have no material at all.
59cbd4aa-3f1f-4f72-b483-15b2249c9c5c|Nothing exists outside the material world.
d29f9f3d-4f85-4687-85d4-8822364ec752|The material will just have to speak for itself.
98528e53-edea-4afa-927e-7b0ff3f6b15d|You'd never get within a mile of him.
9eca95bb-c5e9-46f5-a8ef-94ea106c16ec|My own house is ten miles away.
fdd2007b-465a-47f7-acaa-19ab0830237c|It goes on like that for a mile!
a5e44eac-f6a5-4d41-9f04-2e261481b766|The boy of course, are you stupid or what!
8fdd2393-3dd0-4db9-916b-b7e8ba3de86d|And, of course, it was also your idea.
0a29e906-f48d-43d3-ae03-8441ce0365cd|Of course, I knew he'd never make it.
c440f558-3193-447d-b3c5-2b12b03f624f|They mean it, of course they mean it.
c02ecce7-3314-4d5d-8d6e-34ac2965e6e0|Of course she's home for good.
608dc154-5484-4205-a186-e1395c3bd4d4|In my defense, you do look different.
89474745-af19-4ec5-bd5b-6b54a9b7da6d|In my defense, I had a whole plan.
c34d4f99-7261-468a-928c-58993b2e7b5f|The defense can present in the morning.
fd941357-a807-4ebd-803a-5951ceb21600|You're one answer away from destroying their whole defense.
64a8938c-23cc-4698-8908-3ed8bb8874c5|She's going to feed Mike to her defense team.
dbe39d93-92e8-4923-aa00-802bdb798bc1|I bought this for the plants.
413bf519-c09a-4361-9b98-c22925394420|The person who hired you to plant that bomb.
c19f331b-0d48-4579-a45d-4d1a7d844eef|Can you not touch my plant?
73259c10-2076-4092-99ca-3a974015e4d3|Where do you want the plant?
b041f2a3-5ccc-4d16-83e0-cc2a7cda5337|I'm paying you for your energy and your passion.
61d7a638-bdde-4b2a-8a47-94314b1c8ec9|You're not gonna have any energy out there.
56f0ccc8-cf5d-429f-a176-4f2f6072b673|I absolutely think that we should keep campaigning.
a6fd3215-5a32-4d0c-bd0c-3a4e0eee1c80|They were taken by another campaign.
ba31e438-46e5-484f-b362-a9f5b4b66220|I even got him on the campaign.
42c1c2ff-d75a-465f-a96d-21a37fbad2ef|Once on the way home he saw a fire.
ed2c6685-1563-4654-a258-7d2c8cfb8aff|Somebody who was in the fire with him.
645eea7b-823f-4451-8219-74ad9a381378|Soldiers sitting about waiting for the firing to start.
c06dab9b-51d0-429f-855c-8f45d83268b7|I'm glad I wasn't on fire.
cbcda811-0a48-4e9d-a52b-f52488719b74|I'm just closing my eyes.
5d5161c6-381d-4a90-81ff-aa79ab66069d|That door may be closed.
baca4342-7b3d-4f68-8406-ee666089e1db|I closed my eyes and thought of England.
d3b255e1-d3fb-4021-aef6-9ca80ed10b09|How do I close it?
b1d2f14e-e684-4a38-98bf-66b97103b2a0|Well, it looked amazing, but it was closed.
b95ecc13-8c8e-4162-bdba-580e6e7c792b|Your daughters are gonna grow up without you.
d41c9715-3619-4ac0-bfc9-fe857e4d6313|But I can't bring fun home to my daughter.
fbc2348a-21f5-49b5-b900-49c9d680ca61|Come on, she's your daughter.
bcfc6773-d0bd-459a-b72b-907fd7a4c59f|You all stay away from my daughter.
7119eb7c-3ad0-4e2d-943c-d0e82c66d6ea|My daughter passed four years ago.
8acbc9cd-6a9c-44da-9f2d-3f19afaae6f5|I told him I wouldn't get involved.
25a5036a-a06e-4520-aa61-c05a454203e3|You know that we can't involve the police, right?
aadb9f65-e8e8-4021-b32e-c33c938a345b|Don't make my son get involved.
0234116d-18c6-4844-a78e-4d66354909b9|Just don't get him involved.
dfc4a533-9724-4db7-9652-51d09161263d|Does your plan involve a gun?
3ea4990c-6b09-4dd5-b775-e9d518c3a489|You haven't met my husband, have you?
0df5faa9-6dca-4e38-a878-9cf5a773d8e0|Yeah, shows the husband he means business.
c242c078-7d6f-4f3c-ba7a-6b7405bbb23b|We were never husband and wife.
6f72e1cd-13be-4bab-b76f-661ee2993526|What about those two husbands?
78e9ca77-e9dd-411c-aa00-f648c551c78e|Because men always choose the wrong things.
26cc0180-413e-45b4-9f31-fcebcb3e3492|Yeah, there's only one thing wrong with that picture.
da675abd-04a1-4d7a-85c0-02e72d834d0a|Yeah, but am I wrong?
e7040f88-61d0-4160-a370-e25f5ab3646e|What else could go wrong?
2cba181f-5ed0-46a5-bd60-a90d18410174|Ann, tell me what's wrong with Jerry's arm.
95374d84-6ae3-43a3-aef0-0caf9385ffe1|And they certainly love each other.
02d90860-09be-4a7e-9183-74d96d1022dc|Certainly, and with good reason.
e11f580c-b0b3-4e52-b0b0-f5cf53d9ffab|It certainly looks that way.
f5dd49d0-8dbf-415a-ac7b-55d9bb3f9fa0|Nobody was to blame, certainly not you.
bc8f711b-40fd-42bd-8ec3-f45022225598|I'll bring in more men, increase the shifts.
3d47b42e-dda3-4004-b3f2-6249cecf3c50|Probably increased security after what happened at the club.
f4da0c3a-ea7b-4b56-8b6e-de8da80cbf74|To hide behind these walls increases their advantage.
04352d31-12f0-4c51-8bb9-fd37595656f7|The rate of new cases is increasing.
56fefce7-862a-4522-9841-6ad09a00a7a9|These books are from your future.
94b40abb-fa1c-469d-99e5-e78f648db441|Dan, we're talking about your future here.
6741d491-96f2-4438-968e-fc962183a69d|Speaking of the future, what are you doing later?
0b7ead27-3988-4b54-87a7-649febe0a896|Do you want to see your future?
6c087d91-f531-4419-82ef-c72223b9f2a4|The south of France is still free.
642fed8e-f634-4204-b015-a0d0d6af09f5|At last, I was going to see the south.
d6d82414-9d49-40d9-a165-d1b7ee978cf3|Is your settlement south of here?
94618fad-c50a-41de-b335-627d216e9c61|We'll be in the south soon.
f3f689e6-fa2f-49b6-9205-26988ed982f3|And where did he go to medical school?
39d12dae-0978-4599-aa90-3806bca09ae7|Well, we need another medical opinion on this.
f02c1b14-68bd-46ed-bea1-9bf1da87cfa3|It'll still need medical attention.
69543942-6b25-4249-b881-73232265ea02|So when can I start making calls again?
7b7d3526-a6c9-47c9-a31f-b6c1db83692e|I might take that, call in on her later.
99e6f68d-ae71-4efd-9249-fabadfbb9bc8|I haven't looked into the calls yet.
ed336f07-4c67-4ab5-bf99-f69690468f22|I got a call out to both of them.
43faff07-922b-46f1-842e-bb975fc76d9f|Your mother and everybody else on board.
b9ecda24-0247-4da9-bc11-eab406f64dd9|Now are you on board with that?
5df2686c-449c-4cef-a8c7-5f27db104df8|There is no more food on board.
79881fd6-8f35-4d10-b1da-448dc5b2a895|I haven't said this in a while to anyone.
4631ab63-8419-4f97-b820-d7ec072e40a0|Doesn't seem to be anyone home.
fd081bab-ae3a-4724-a011-93c2b5f8a50b|I had to deal with the tax man.
a46e97c7-989e-4c09-adda-3309ddcdcb4c|I should know how to deal with stupid people.
681b1db4-01a6-44d9-8cdc-94aa831993ef|They don't know what they're dealing with.
2dd10aee-b3a4-4a2d-8642-c449802a3d06|No, it's better to deal with the truth.
767ce518-5018-48a5-b20d-9a8b7d84f9a5|He'll be out of the hospital in two weeks.
afb5f7dc-b3f6-41d1-badf-200743500d03|Didn't even have him in a hospital.
3f43938a-ecd3-48db-be89-0afe4a79bb20|But remember: This is just a rest stop.
a4b3a087-d267-49e0-afb8-1f28c63a46cc|I'd pay it back with the rest.
adc5b723-a7c4-43bb-a533-7ade8b74b361|Seeking truth is a great start to our day.
17c5eef6-47a9-4745-bd54-911d07333389|I have no need to seek work.
48be5b3e-c65f-4f75-8516-ddf622e6910f|A girl who could be the one he seeks.
bf42cad1-108b-4b41-9255-b393e0b2b44d|Those that seek truth will find it.
57d1f3d9-92c3-4cb0-b753-e86f26120a35|I've always done everything for myself, like you.
ad940c77-7d33-4fd2-bea8-f51428777b94|I must watch out for myself.
662368c3-7ffd-4f79-a8ed-623052261927|I just heard myself say that.
a8b464f1-b7ac-4d6f-84ed-f152e2c35689|I told you I could think for myself.
224e3af8-1253-4139-bcdd-eaaf9d83921a|But we'll book him first at county.
8c5c2d35-0c04-45e0-ac68-f0b1a440894f|We did every hill in the county.
bd7f327e-2f62-4cfd-8b2d-a2f90bfb8aae|I want every newspaper in the county there.
3321aa59-1394-4f8e-bbdb-eec548dc6b98|I feel sick about fighting with you.
44de2199-e2ad-4e0f-8915-d3674e509790|I'm not letting you fight alone.
6c9705eb-e2de-439f-81dc-88935ce5a896|I fought for my people, and for you.
d55179d1-8ce3-4aa5-8bbf-8ea7f8b10723|I'm not sure if I can fight for it.
45fe63e2-d1de-419c-80f2-8f1839115282|We're here to fight with you.
e8ae130d-d67c-4b13-b337-2316791f7609|Well, don't try to change the subject.
3bd96527-f381-4213-a523-5953322be49f|And you must look at the subject.
28af7b39-a6ac-417c-baae-d4473480d167|What's happening with your subject?
f413c974-c403-4898-b33f-4a9ba2c2c081|But, oh, look at you, avoiding the subject!
eaec7606-f258-4573-adc9-e7ac0de2c851|All these people are your subjects now.
a6eca9ad-1dcf-4385-9a0b-d1a9de374fa7|I know what they're at risk for.
d66e1224-229c-43f7-b422-e792b7a6f217|But pressure will force you to take risks.
79596a00-3cbc-454c-92da-cec9525a122c|It was a risk we had to take.
aab7a958-2c83-4b42-b624-931494597923|Don't follow orders your whole life.
3549ec81-8367-455f-9622-0053df896181|I don't take orders from any man.
25417c3d-245d-441a-935e-80fb9e42d069|We're closing up by orders of the government.
9eaebc10-8656-430f-9173-0b9dd310a9ed|And keeps everything in order.
17f77961-a625-4f14-99d8-387a89db4916|I'm just following orders, Sarah.
efe82508-b137-4730-a5d1-320e416faff7|The mountains to the west, we could go there.
1fa59dd5-217b-4699-9e0a-001147197b72|I'm approaching the west side of the station.
eeb6686e-1f42-4e40-8c06-9d13b66a646f|Yes, I just arrived in your wild west.
b7605f74-bc9d-44dd-b053-58334b60a9c4|These economy boxes are not very large.
3aa5afa4-23fb-4d7a-bca0-9e38a59b038a|Today's economy, it's rough out there.
d209f554-1c1e-46bb-a5d1-819a446c1ee4|I'll finish this quickly and come back.
15082f95-4c9e-431d-bb1f-9157e943dad6|You left the party so quickly.
59374bf6-e701-4679-a520-e013c7428df2|Things are going to change very quickly.
bae5aae7-4f24-418f-bcff-b3a94eda29a1|This all happened very quickly.
dd8f8a68-f913-46e9-8245-ae4e9ff781cb|Throw some water on yourself.
4ea6231b-f5dc-4ecc-b8b4-3fe641bb16f5|My friend just threw up.
0bd4e701-b990-433a-8659-3402ab1794fe|I tried to throw it away, but I couldn't.
5d6608f9-9db2-4823-b1ef-ab7c521c0188|Why don't you just go back to bed?
98c9dc3f-5807-45b3-8b58-a40b31247b9e|Can't remember the last time we had a bed.
ddfb13de-4402-4ab1-a118-54a42536822a|You're the first guy to sleep in my bed.
dfd2df1e-6dba-416d-9ec2-e30610d64871|I don't know about the other police officers.
1ddfb67a-0d8b-482f-b766-b5f59f7b761a|Her three brothers are officers.
a0f25fad-614f-44a2-b9e4-d258aa8f166d|Another officer's dead because you shot your mouth off.
3aeb0b71-a7df-42a1-9213-dbc5240552f7|Two of my officers have gone missing.
0cfd351b-4be8-4b9c-8e4f-5e07da0a3330|This officer's gonna show you to your car.
bc501fb7-6187-4aef-951c-0785c26388ab|We don't represent them, Anna.
1ca05a5f-f835-4152-90b0-4c4634625758|Look, I'll be there soon.
e3046432-2db8-4d1b-aa98-8ddea1732ba4|He'll grow out of it sooner or later.
7a2d2bc2-7d68-42e3-8d8f-076daaa3d60d|I'll get back to you soon as I can.
7c6b4c89-42af-405a-82d2-4e0337b60bf9|How soon can you get out of there?
cea74a42-866a-496f-bbc1-e01b8118beb7|I told you this was too soon.
df94d21f-ec6b-4c84-aa94-5c26907e7b12|Just stay on top of his vision.
e3146bb0-784e-4356-b79a-692e4b42fd1f|You have to keep on top of it.
80a7b6f4-bf44-4660-b3e4-72e968c0679f|That is not the top of my head!
a89db7cc-caaf-46df-babc-e4e11cbf93c4|His computer will be filled with research on them.
342ff07a-d316-4e11-8a85-862c3dcd65ad|He's been doing an amazing job filling in.
7d46bf14-6517-48f9-bb70-581ce449acbb|Who can blame me crying my fill?
1cd19825-41e6-4b23-a6cb-3d554bdaa202|And is this supposed to fill me up?
6127817f-ad08-4163-b267-ce1bc0f4b480|You're going to be a published author.
d12238d5-e4bf-4c75-9e9d-5f96f1547c10|You sleep with all your authors?
8314caea-4715-458d-a7df-9b36b2bc6301|How do you know about the author?
55147e98-d512-442e-855a-588e2265fa10|I met this famous American author.
9c304db9-413c-44c7-95f3-64a6cc7f02ed|The past few months, Bobby has been different.
648acb94-9e21-4bbc-acf0-c0e821054073|How was Danny over the past few days?
195d6439-a2a5-4439-bb50-268ffcc12263|I've grown a lot these past couple of weeks.
8299f567-988c-407c-b160-b3262ca6500d|No, no, no, we are past that.
739fd284-eb3a-48a1-81a5-6f7a2c2c6186|Upon each step is a test.
645f12f0-a07a-4d73-b6b7-8c45536fd2de|That time and those people are upon you.
f859b7c6-3750-4013-8680-1d4acb3063fa|Make him pay back, without giving up my goal.
b5972d2f-4075-4bc9-a971-8d6d4997f977|One man between him and the goal line.
c311a71d-25fa-46a5-860b-749ea5b1329f|You couldn't normally make a goal like that!
148a01f8-58d2-460a-9892-601c0dcd426e|Well, the behavior points to one obvious theory.
b4001ec2-7850-4279-b6c8-007927c20a9e|You think you're capable of good behavior ?
968be887-a4d8-437d-bc5b-2bc64c59bca2|We'll be on our best behavior.
25e2b887-c04d-4e95-bf4a-ec2e8cd9b968|I call people out on their bad behavior.
69d5c2af-48df-4856-8016-6a49d615a2dd|Just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
78d527da-d794-4786-9dd2-9e68623afc21|I wish he'd drop dead!
c845d4de-225d-4add-b4e8-bd7752e99797|The Morgan family just dropped out of the show.
79b78e65-689b-4cf7-9ed9-eab5b6fe1a16|We'll drop in and set off from there.
abc5ed98-94b0-4c2b-bfaa-bac24d28509d|I could've just dropped him off at the door.
019fd2ed-89a4-4e4b-bb33-cd0a88e6793d|Why write inside when you can write in nature?
c4128e21-d1f8-4ba9-9b0b-c8e58e438cd8|They're too busy stealing to study human nature.
d8174156-e9f2-4574-850f-6196b27bcc4d|Now we wait for nature to take its course.
90cbafcc-87b2-4c8f-b6e2-6c59c2ac5370|He slept with a girl from the agency.
c3c89c93-b212-4aae-8797-c5d75924752e|Oh, no agency would claim us.
05bf123e-33c8-4e01-9cd8-704cbe1d96ae|Do you remember this woman from the estate agency.
ec2d5c58-5da6-4006-93f9-9d9c5f0a1203|Whatever it is, whatever you've got planned.
3beef5e5-7c3a-44c3-a9c9-6a94937f2d2a|I know what you're planning to do.
9328f390-72d3-4c51-9ea1-cd050f07726a|And I plan to keep it that way.
a2f05c47-832c-47ed-85ab-f537d48b520a|Then how do you plan to use it?
32dbb804-6694-419c-8c33-9c7185693d7c|And how do you plan to protect me?
c5680cb2-64e0-45ec-a261-c637cdea274d|I've had major surgery recently.
3133146f-1634-4f09-b82e-b724e7317061|You weren't like this recently.
8542fa56-057c-4d40-875a-398fd21b2ec0|It was her birthday recently.
5000aefe-86ac-422f-bcad-86fe6d445681|In the last well, you know, recently.
6b15e097-e1ff-4c57-ae9c-9da8540b0c0e|He'll be on you in about ten seconds.
38a5781a-e25c-4a9e-86ce-751e9dc06950|You have three seconds to make us believe you.
de2eb796-84ad-4a53-b687-0601628e1ca5|You only knew her for, what, like, two seconds?
88415ead-d2c0-43c4-a0ba-cec176f64ce2|You'll be all right for a few seconds.
bfa65b0c-a74d-46d6-a0cd-169048814a06|That old man stole things from my store!
5b3d2014-d6de-4547-bc1d-56cb804f7697|You know, you can get those at the store.
bf2ee58b-e9e4-4ec0-8c34-5290e30de5fa|I'm very glad the store isn't paying.
4083215b-5596-45aa-bd7e-3dceed463eb9|By the way, I dropped into the clothes store.
e9cd2970-130d-428b-8961-7483a736ad5a|How did things go at the store today?
f2876e62-bece-4ef8-87ec-5246b4e2fa3a|It's illegal for foreign companies to buy land there.
b2d3693a-d106-40b1-8050-c42447b69bba|And those are just our foreign threats.
361d9826-6033-4f49-8d2e-2b6d79abbb88|What foreign tongue are they speaking?
5662ae3f-0fc5-46ae-8f92-786536e94384|I was told I just needed my current license.
f3eefd4e-eaf9-4fab-827a-9a24fcc7d32e|We need more current down here.
e9328eb3-3238-4996-b1b0-4f5cd3e2724c|Can I see your current class schedule?
a164eb05-7d7c-4d32-8a50-f13239ec263d|The current would wash it right to this beach.
92f4856d-b97b-4730-b044-5a09942896b2|Yeah, three bank jobs in the last two months.
a92eb13b-752a-410b-818f-88c3d93f51b7|I thought you were coming into the bank.
bfaa2387-ac4f-49e6-91d9-271d6ef03e62|Maybe the money is even still in the bank.
e5237379-a3b9-4a44-918c-f7aff0fb770d|I don't see Banks, either.
ebdc4c5e-d228-400a-a74a-d04eabf3568c|I love the sounds it makes.
05286ba3-c401-4cd8-abf8-53d191ae86ea|Let's see if we can get some sounds.
a256cb4f-002d-401e-9b22-c2794b98061b|That's when I really found my sound.
4e551d8c-4828-40f8-9147-acfdf74a9b4a|Well, it's good to see you safe and sound.
834b2ea4-8935-4e32-a28e-5e298f3aa0da|We already heard this sound.
c0989996-19f6-48ed-949c-12417a20ce39|Maybe pushed him to do it.
fdb0fd52-b13a-4b90-a312-cf3a0ff99542|I think we should push it off the street.
acecbef5-361b-441e-a9e8-59f607ba021f|Stop pushing me away with both hands.
8fdd80f6-3b90-49ec-852b-7fd95aee8ef6|You pushed him right in front of me.
5fc07f44-d5da-4f90-932c-f65a05ee649b|Don't push it at me!
fede3b1f-3c73-4b89-8592-17b5fad298ec|We focus on what comes next.
2ff46fd0-fc4b-40d8-b3ec-2cef0127623c|All right, we focus on her.
543e2547-77f9-42a8-8441-d8e6ba075a9f|I try not to focus on that.
aeb04605-36f8-40dd-86ec-72374599e81a|In I can not focus when you are here.
941e263e-20b6-4297-9434-2e0ef9a43b8f|We have to stay focused on our work.
73c9324d-98c8-4b17-a64b-ab07744b8e9f|So now I'm reduced to sleeping in the bar!
6c27ca7a-bfae-4313-b99f-6c985ce9de7a|It's been proven that soft music reduces stress.
97a08152-368e-43b8-8c73-ada81fc1c6ca|Will you sign this thank you note?
c00eaa59-efef-4777-989e-6c4c1b28ce6e|Are there noted places along our route?
3a2a522e-0c86-438a-a96a-02825a12d353|I'll note you in my book of memory.
a47f9966-48ba-4e11-aa88-b44e1696e364|Note taken, sorry about that.
b19c66dc-799d-40a4-9f83-9934056a5d6b|And stop sending me notes every other day.
2a236a2a-eeb8-44a3-b934-ca0de91fee66|I know where I've seen it before.
958e1e52-49e6-46f1-87c1-e1d4672f30de|Why haven't I heard this before?
eedec065-562c-4afe-97f4-60bf542279e2|You've done this before, haven't you?
8d8aaa42-4a72-4c42-a017-bd463ea1d921|I liked the way I was standing before, actually.
efc08cfb-6be7-401f-8e75-1e952f75735c|I know where I've heard that before.
239a0be1-4ff8-4439-9792-74721f45b601|It's not my finest two days, I will admit.
2c1fccb0-2c06-4645-9816-f77d55f28dbf|You say, no, right here, near your eye.
8d0d18f8-0d5a-4635-b822-ac9717630508|They don't go near the drugs.
17df8324-43db-4028-ace3-b250313d4f93|I told you not to come near me.
f890b90f-ac53-4c89-9df6-5dc495c62172|She does not come near me.
736b8335-0b5c-428c-9eb9-f065496b6372|Charlie, don't go near it.
5ac3944a-d2f1-4e57-b72d-a829cd5efdcf|This is how movements die.
cf49fb97-2621-48e2-aa26-a4c1b710cf96|There's definitely some movement up ahead.
b6acf6fa-8602-4ddc-a347-4d5e447d7c36|There should be movement, right?
b382e166-c377-480c-adc2-c77a3ed97265|Because the movement of our hand has become hot.
20a26f73-5d35-459c-bb46-87b7af9f26be|Well then, we share a common enemy.
bf75c65f-2b1a-422e-aca2-ce2b60182ac0|It's very common, and easily dealt with.
4c98dc8a-7557-4852-bcaa-67a4ed7fc2ce|We had one big thing in common.
b2d9297a-0d57-44a9-974d-35457bdf61dc|Two missing women, with you in common.
eef21b26-cb5d-4bd7-ae2f-85d5619df57a|There are billion of people in this world.
a38d4405-4d49-4a67-a793-42766b206e3c|Seven grasses feed almost seven billion people.
2192e417-847f-463e-a057-e34f6ffd9a60|One billion people, two billion ears.
c35df107-edc1-481e-b3f1-01ccd3f98341|Or there'll be more blood on your hands.
6a6afa19-cdf9-487b-860f-fd55de3d6732|Didn't you already take my blood?
89daad7d-75dc-4719-8d96-d464a576b648|There's more blood over there.
f64316ef-59fb-4cde-bbf8-06accb663b8e|I'd been dreaming about blood.
636fca33-5f8f-4eb2-b2d9-e64a518ff2cb|Who wants to be blood brothers?
2c67feb1-c4b1-4b91-bd36-5d4b43b550fc|I had to read each page three times.
b654ee13-8dc6-4bed-b45d-f24a17dfc60c|This goes on like this for two pages.
44b57209-bb49-407a-9777-9b974f47838a|You read those pages I gave to you?
0e0797c1-e93c-4edb-923a-734cfb05f11c|And why would that concern your team?
98f4affe-b7b7-4e7d-83f7-e0e558d633ba|Nothing that need concern you, my child.
3bff567b-9373-49a7-80ec-39ecda3d47fe|Thanks for your concern, but the answer is no.
2ba51c4a-92bd-4133-8774-56a4dcb5d14f|We must all share his concern.
8e1c73a0-9881-4219-89a1-dbf19b4bf89a|The poor girl never saw it coming.
70aedb03-4abf-49df-b323-db863ef7d9ba|Must have been a poor man.
343ca747-8448-4b3a-a21e-ce15e2df78a9|His poor mother had the same.
b7d94dd0-495d-4374-8005-b67177bdb573|Where did he go in his poor condition?
4d667fd8-1b81-478e-9ea3-bd463827324e|She says you should enter.
e0fb6e25-9d94-4baf-b5e1-4681b06b378b|Always open both doors when you enter a room?
d72613a0-699e-422e-b4a4-51e4309958c0|You want me to enter as well?
cf8ce928-967d-47d9-b3f6-f6a6b172e0ac|Barney and Robin enter here.
c99f7998-b064-4251-98dd-b6072cecc4e7|I believe that is a quality we share.
2baaff73-616e-4e9b-9b17-e3c50a1fca40|So many families sharing the same name.
a6d8c36f-1c5d-42aa-9a76-75d8a87a26b7|Did you share my concerns about the larger community?
dc07e65f-3eeb-4256-ae26-2a59979ff777|If you share it, you haven't got it.
dc67702a-a3f2-443e-a6df-0c166ae23b70|He wants to go straight to series.
1c0b154a-8558-4e2e-9b1b-78b9d7cf7c3b|We have to run a series of tests.
ab773be8-0b64-409f-a817-e67559a7763f|In the seat that I usually sit in.
cde640ee-c05e-4156-a246-7448a7f59767|He never usually likes guys.
5d34b1cc-0a80-4ce2-b168-7cf0d49ab587|Well, how long does this usually last?
4802975b-165d-48e4-a30a-6a4b88392a86|But usually when you call us, we have fun.
95c9692f-122f-4398-83c7-25ad3f6fc4ca|We don't usually work this kind of case.
c68adc60-0fc7-4048-9374-ed2811ec72f3|And to live within the natural law.
dfd02e74-d6e8-4f69-baa4-38adf216bc7f|So, it was death by natural causes.
d243fa04-19ff-4a7f-b940-dcb97df290c5|They all look and feel completely natural.
cf6518e1-6e9d-4988-9ebd-cfd2db23b06f|You guys are hot together.
826b6dfc-7bc1-44df-abc6-a09d484586e0|Apparently, the hot water was not working.
78d8475f-214b-4a4e-8262-01fe3cb5e8a4|I mean, a real hot one.
e83d550e-e433-4f95-89bd-819f6fbb3c43|I'm off, it's too hot in here.
ac73aaae-c042-4d9c-b9ad-6b873be2fc44|I think you can do that, you're pretty hot.
44ea7d80-4c78-40c6-8da9-7ce40909e387|We'll never win a race in that thing.
1ebb6125-39cc-4d89-bd31-df5a94de99b2|The man is the same race as her.
312e73bc-7481-4809-aadf-201c6d02e079|We came to watch you win the race.
2b3c24b7-ba6d-4ec6-87c5-a1d074005d09|I mean, have you ever seen him race?
9982b71c-e172-45e4-9a77-042eebbe53eb|Where were you the night before the race?
37ea9895-0b54-4d8a-8a6f-9c9189bcb635|I told you I've had it with your language.
8a968d5f-a659-405d-9fce-4b3365649093|Your body language says you're lying.
3ca37e60-792b-4114-9dc3-60089495bcf8|No rivers that connect to the sea.
e21beda1-7141-491b-9053-d81d167b8666|We'll be safe under the river.
0615b272-6cc1-4efb-b33d-320772831895|He never put their heads in the river.
7acb364d-5fc5-419c-bd26-0caa3c45d247|I did find something by the river, though.
a27ba4ef-c083-4602-a108-5fc85b9126c9|Chris doesn't move, but he's not dead.
f82a4f8d-ef2d-48d0-954f-90369f033f06|That way, when you're dead, I'll be the strongest.
a66f66ef-ce34-4b0f-a794-fe3935a239d5|I thought she is dead.
1d377df9-2186-4105-9b33-1131df40fcde|That's why William wants you dead.
a1f3e29f-6999-4e17-b780-4483ed41a706|What do you mean, they're all dead?
930428f5-5da6-4f03-a671-22d05ec72f63|You can drop the whole caring friend act.
3129b867-744c-48a4-bf08-9766aa910a1f|They know it's all just an act.
30e9508f-2505-48e5-b6a3-a0e753310a05|There's a couple more acts I wouldn't mind seeing.
fabf92f2-0e72-438c-9f54-6b3c71d28cd8|You're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?
2f6cc825-ea00-40f6-a145-898daf6dee48|I ask you a question, I expect a response.
989e755b-017d-4734-ba17-dde7a956eaba|The questions about your response time?
57ded437-7f50-497d-9133-f77f533227ee|I think I have his response to that.
752586b3-84ea-49fc-bd7f-3773e40c3277|I rise and come to this room.
cb80b7f7-0a14-4e6c-b0ac-ce98aa7a41ba|There are many hours before the sun rises.
14642299-1bd6-4eb1-8f54-5bcd1286181e|Well, maybe not rising, but it is here.
3c041cc1-0ed9-45f5-8750-ebeff778fd57|Here I am, with a rose at my mouth.
863c20d9-0a90-4acd-a1c4-a4e79d5e077b|And she'd not seen him for decades, remember?
6917b1ee-9efd-4e6a-bee2-fc52d68b0e21|I saw no one within decades of my age.
2dca86ef-3ce6-43dc-999e-15d5c51540ef|He hasn't been president for two decades.
f9585846-10ac-4658-8dc1-71035657a1c5|You should write magazine articles.
bc81952c-a991-469d-9b4b-8f08e5d71d3a|I'll lay out the articles as usual.
487db2d6-0fb6-401c-be2f-9595cad442c4|Look, what's your angle on this article, anyway?
1a0f0c65-bd62-4097-a401-6a38f45728e1|You given any more thought to that magazine article?
df3f3398-980e-4d8b-b228-3462cdda280f|I got my first article published.
f1ff7938-49b2-439a-961e-91c2d5510e91|And thus far, I'd have to say he's right.
96828658-84d1-4730-bf36-e5d089940620|She is thus and so.
21beb1b0-f0ed-458a-808a-90db33a455ed|Have your arms ready, thus.
8f29bb18-52c0-413d-82b9-7e58140f7706|Thus, it was fired during a criminal act.
8876a8fb-a290-4d7e-b8e4-aed823ed519f|Only thus can we avoid trouble for us both.
c7a36fe8-46c2-496f-9bdf-48960243f5e3|I live in town and I left around seven.
598cf518-fa33-4922-80d2-5224dc218b52|I was six or seven at the time.
8f8c5ca0-686f-46f5-b1d4-7b6fdf55c663|I've got seven hours, tops.
ab6e6221-7f7e-455f-8fbc-731769b3f388|I have seven kinds of tea, all right?
32ea6cd7-88f4-46f7-b569-82603f60e40b|But she shot me down.
308fa81a-151f-429c-bcfa-34f1ce8bca46|In Ireland they shoot you if you work.
8a1bb8ff-6d7c-47ab-aec3-699a8d13a4a2|Shouldn't they be shooting at him?
38d4cdaa-f0c2-45df-afef-0a0d077c6cb8|He didn't mean to shoot that man.
9f4eca97-708b-4c84-a7e6-a4185ff1c8eb|I can't believe that you shot me!
ac47d11c-76dc-4642-80ad-8b5606552d87|I mean, they're animals, after all.
cad2b72b-b16e-46e6-9621-dca24cb176e2|But I dreamt of working with animals.
58ecaf64-8ede-4959-8d41-9cd608afe8ed|Aren't they developing a similar drug?
6c33134e-9479-435f-93de-a689d44829c8|It's similar to my mom's restaurant in appearance.
3b08f694-2a70-444b-a7a9-19c35844d186|These seem to me very similar personal choices.
b9141827-86b7-441f-a6ce-db7116602dcc|I've heard it was similar.
2b53a222-dd70-4d8d-afbe-89952f871b4a|It's a very similar style, isn't it?
1bee6d9b-6fff-4e6d-a5ee-4b9fe72747e2|I think you saved me.
f717da54-10fc-4028-ad57-e5c2a3dea242|I'm here to save my best friend.
27862e5d-a9c9-4a2f-9c8c-83416b573fd3|I read that he saved you.
54ac82c6-229b-4068-9a4f-8d8e2526d5e8|Don't worry, Brian, I'll save you.
8c1acd6b-4d6c-44bc-9d73-09ee5f9cfecc|I intend to remove the moon as a factor.
e77c0abf-0f3b-4e1d-9b29-a9d5f9da48ac|Apparently time is a factor here.
a03137d9-c53c-4eb7-b004-a2fe82a0df84|That's probably how they knew about central park.
642f3334-6e80-4456-9f75-92f50e80df9f|Complete radio silence at the central site.
e6843ca7-7b86-4515-9652-cdc6af7897d4|But they're saying it attacks the central nervous system.
9e4b01cb-8262-452d-9883-f26458a0968e|That thought had not occurred to me.
6e512ca1-b383-4b5a-a2ac-5f664a34626a|And how did the accident occur?
4c96ec49-092c-4d5a-becb-0e59617e258e|That thought never occurred to me.
ae955fe8-2ab3-4268-a20a-37d1a1ea9890|I will be on that committee.
5274976b-09f9-433d-a8a5-e8fdb40320c2|Today, I can tell this committee even more.
ca7436bf-2516-47fc-9894-7d38d6267bb5|I blame the wine committee very much.
92861ae3-a691-446c-9c5b-1e21095ccbe8|I am done with this whole committee thing.
d51ab858-cdc7-45ea-910f-8023d87be760|She might end up doing some serious time.
889a13c9-8152-4bf2-8fa0-95cc9fdb3f9c|And if you're serious, let me know.
64e044e7-2f8c-49eb-a322-b09140486a82|It's just that, I mean, are they serious?
b19dcb91-b735-4ba7-a128-570691b47139|Does that sound at all serious to you?
3577af3a-f4ce-4e6a-81ce-6b0600240f1a|Does that mean that they're getting serious?
3a29ec44-540d-44ba-8e58-4ce7c67d84b0|You must be really good at sports.
890d8774-aac3-4960-8620-9c1721567f1b|Let's get you all playing all the different sports.
0fed878a-64dd-4aae-bf99-da9090831457|She's into sports and hates games man.
627d69a0-d462-4c48-b941-a9efb67a6ce4|Maybe it's doing it for sport.
06aab43f-9c20-4cc4-a3b8-d8d7fb0c0716|If you ever lie to me again.
92c83ba9-e20f-47bf-b06e-11f648c6931d|And beyond that, how did they get here?
0f7f536b-a09a-49a2-8d86-d0b730b4f3b4|We have to consider things beyond our feelings.
9f0efb08-f9b2-49bb-84d9-c2231b091566|Beyond that there's nothing we can do about it.
455492a9-bbdc-4091-ac3d-5e9c9ba32313|Beyond that, I can't tell you.
b9382145-bc80-4643-92bc-be9854379198|And that, you said that exactly.
6adb460b-bd40-478f-8379-221160914b25|What exactly did you expect?
7fb167fd-a938-4256-ae65-d19dddc7bf8e|That's exactly what was running through my mind.
239df67e-c126-4cc2-8a33-479b06c41d5d|And yet, despite all, I feel joy.
a673cd57-df51-4844-bca9-1fa82aafbd43|What's got you so happy today?
c86aaa72-d054-4b2b-bee1-a7532bc93b3e|There will never be happy with you!
f3978a6f-e4d8-40cd-b034-15f4d9ef6bea|I'm just happy to be out of that house.
b6a01383-d5ba-4aa7-baca-97a9888c6f52|What the hell happened during those eight hours?
8903cdc2-5c9a-475b-ade8-5c5d0f933ff3|No, love, trust me, we said eight.
4fd99685-f7c5-4838-8b89-ef65d0d7fd9a|You still had eight weeks more than we did.
d4c3d8ba-4145-4deb-8c82-1fca0eb887a3|Jamie's always looked after me, protected me.
e0a97137-6a66-4a8c-bfa9-3537adf2352d|I knew I couldn't protect you from her.
866ec1a6-0a85-4136-8129-ebec1d4ecc61|You were only trying to protect me, dad.
bd5a70be-17ce-4760-ba02-756e4eb87d43|I'm trying to protect both you and I.
07154fb6-3dd8-4744-9673-4af854347e3c|That I couldn't protect you.
d5c6f910-b1ea-4b44-916e-b7febb2b4fba|He doesn't like my name on any lists.
95ba6db6-de68-400b-9a9c-8866593b491c|Well, let's go down the list.
b6f0bad6-4852-49e9-8a52-8a10790cd8a6|She needs to take Mary off of her list.
10c387c6-e8dc-4fa7-a21b-8d090c38ce4a|She gonna put you on the list?
0333c320-cc09-4c24-8f18-50ede480c349|By doing this stupid list?
37690c5b-07bf-4d1d-9c4f-ef9169e79ca5|This is, like, a one size fits all.
2bbe3d2e-0e29-42c4-a844-200d5464ca61|Check these boots out for size.
9c671688-75a5-4bd3-9769-a940569b30a0|Anyway, I found some clothes about your size.
05606ae3-aac9-43ac-97f2-a899561295bf|No, the head size is normal.
1f305bb6-a76a-407c-bf82-217db897646a|Do those come in different sizes?
c0381646-90c5-4347-b6f0-f3a9be9ed87f|You wouldn't believe the quality of people in here.
855c3962-8bea-4e6d-a0a0-8d713888d9d9|That's one of your best qualities.
de376f8c-8022-4dcb-b24a-1dff7dc0b718|She says her blood pressure's too high.
f3beb00c-bcc5-46ad-9a6b-f7df5b0b355c|And I just need a night of no pressure.
29e68584-5f78-431a-a9bd-45e069145fa9|The pressure that I can't fail is my weapon.
3bc6335c-51f0-4caa-b9c2-ba00bc3e7e06|No, no, I don't accept this.
d13759a8-d120-48fb-83b8-9c6b47efae85|If that's what you want, I'll accept that.
0b44a62e-be93-4988-8616-ce7678eb4708|You might as well accept it.
876a6110-54d8-4618-95e9-ea07c34999ad|One day you'll have to accept that.
c0ffd66a-1c13-44e6-9585-b787ba6f00fa|I'd just like to have a team ready.
0a6d072c-cc47-4fe5-8329-f5cc3c5859fd|You get ready to take care of Rachel.
ab74f43e-6795-4a75-b6ed-bdb745281d98|I'm getting their approach signals now.
ed4ec4e2-1f12-41e8-852b-06c5b632ed82|Let me try a different approach.
34f68db6-c2fb-409e-ba85-ff3c1a982353|How did you make your approach to her?
0b058576-a8c6-499f-bce5-a79a19f28893|We approach from the night side.
f6817816-409e-4ce4-a084-b468b2c7da4b|I sort of have that Brooklyn approach.
98a9730a-de6d-4d4e-adef-f6af9858c885|But, still, all the signs are there.
cba0b299-597f-4c9c-bc2f-57217aea016c|You see any street signs?
4cee4a8d-b0ac-4829-9abc-bf21e6b59075|I want to shoot this sign.
413ba106-b1e3-4780-be65-ac3b27d1f289|Can you show us a sign?
3dd067be-7c06-4257-97ab-f45927552602|You also are gonna sign there.
d05fce22-63e9-4107-a8b0-077020d28406|He makes his attacks look like accidents.
fbc58f25-b0e0-4429-96e1-9bae7c8fce3a|Why would I attack you?
a0f394b7-9227-4a98-b2e9-87aaed9c5e01|I want to attack your class.
f08eed1e-df8e-4e9b-a1dc-99ab1e1f26fe|She thinks we plan to attack her?
a94fcaa0-e302-46a7-8dd2-73849b596b99|We're talking about the end of your career.
0bba30bb-ba4a-47b5-ae15-3bed8a7d9238|I would still have had a movie career!
c2582a0b-9f0e-4f09-8b15-14e6d8babd7c|These days career is more important than money.
b896763f-ddc2-4841-a59b-1eae1e9bb132|I've heard the answer to our marriage proposal.
42516924-0efc-46b4-b0fc-0c38084afe0b|Yeah, but no one has the answers, you know?
0a91b599-b7b6-4428-bf7b-67c19c1d11a0|I didn't get any answers.
374e19ea-b154-46cd-b2ae-1f618725ea3a|For the dog, come and help!
395921fc-e118-40a0-8346-12f9dcbadde9|My family's dog, not my dog.
dad20eb3-5c32-4025-b05b-bbc8935c3b78|We can hold those dogs back.
f5420438-5230-413d-9bd5-110a62817af5|Your dog looks like he could use some water.
ba1b65c8-10a8-4df5-98db-8c6c2fbdb638|You want the media, call the sister.
0debe6c1-6110-490a-9a09-1da218297a4f|The biggest effect it had was on the media.
6a3dce74-e995-4b26-a1b8-6ddae07fb856|There should be media in the room.
1707260f-ba8a-47a8-93de-51c1e832ce85|We're ready to go after him in social media.
bde3f1e0-c600-467c-8955-e7792b013bf6|Doesn't have any social media accounts.
9b977fc9-dc67-45e2-b13a-5b665ba37e77|He's too busy thinking deep thoughts.
f6fc3370-7b84-42f6-8b1b-a938a9c0d332|Any thoughts on what it could be?
27a50b31-c4d6-4995-8961-09959918d5f7|I'll certainly give your advice some thought.
d57e05fe-ee4a-4aa6-b4de-8492eb539961|I never gave much thought to tomorrow.
de80c2c7-f9b1-4c17-98b2-573701c76c8e|The thought of walking free from this sounds good.
699d18e9-f997-45bf-8847-a1e9089ade06|Whatever they say, they don't want to lose.
38e8d9e9-73e1-44e8-9034-84271253a07e|Okay, whatever it is, you take a photo.
ef8b6655-d66e-4276-8c54-bd2439ddfcf8|Here, take whatever you want.
0e4c5b5d-8096-46d1-80c9-0fe1e5b46924|Now you hear whatever you wish!
fdf8d59a-38c3-41aa-a216-d9b08ed00fc2|You know, I wonder whatever happened to that kid.
4e761dcd-97ba-43ff-a039-4e92e98a8bc0|Then they'll eat whatever you offer.
496cb56f-82f7-4dd4-baef-7bd7800f1997|No, take him whatever he might need.
302ab8e9-72da-43eb-9769-48a7b422cc26|And it can mean whatever we want.
d4744681-ae38-4576-8dda-b9041f645973|I didn't know he was whatever he said.
815d0baa-a2ac-457c-80c6-8c48c1dea149|So, he said that he'll do whatever he can.
ecca0c68-708d-4310-952e-359b929a236d|Yeah, determined to get himself killed.
3058987c-3b2a-4625-9544-424b2aceb5f5|You've determined who it is?
a8bf9720-f6e4-4493-950e-83a0f83bbf31|But one man was determined to end all that.
2fce6f3a-0648-4de1-bce0-39e11513304d|They're determined to see it through, whatever the cost.
7e1d5f48-9294-4fec-838f-d7b1b4bee562|This boy has an innocent face, but he's determined.
5e400127-6723-4e5e-b240-615ff9955b79|I don't allow my daughter to watch television.
38c271e2-cb91-43d2-89f6-decda2fdb239|I think your dog watches too much television.
fb146eaa-c9a2-40a7-9d7a-fd78f2c294ec|I thought you hated television.
d8a651b8-7da3-47f2-a8f0-3bae003edbe7|We should bring her to our next meeting.
7beae367-6104-426f-a672-60e23a1d4888|I didn't want to miss our meeting.
cb28e708-1369-4079-8e72-d581ec89921b|Sure, but she had meetings there.
73224257-dc4b-48ee-acb6-b8691a30e6a8|I want the minutes from that meeting.
cb68e05d-a229-4776-a1bc-29f4814a34c7|And he was at both crime scenes.
ece17320-1e88-41f2-b42f-7b954b197207|How did Frankie do at the scene?
04408074-26aa-45e2-9393-d0587339c735|We're just about ready to shoot your first scene.
a255cd8c-2eaf-4132-8a9c-31f1e09ca473|I was just on the scene.
175e7368-3812-49da-87ff-ed4e72563519|I would pray for his success.
d73551e7-ccac-4eb5-b90c-b89d706dcaae|I trust your tour was a success?
d27c9b16-6b61-45f8-bc29-db49f8a64e95|My success is your success.
851120c3-cd01-43b5-a672-629f0ed44de9|I heard your last book was a great success.
6024c018-dc94-4f53-bdf7-b2983dc6e9f7|Shouldn't you be preparing for your board interview?
3cec9046-ddc0-481d-948c-79e2e8182fc9|See, they don't prepare you.
a437cd4b-4923-42f2-8442-9723a0a658ba|Thank you so much for preparing that for us.
0802cd2c-3ad5-4118-919f-d02796aa929d|We still have to be prepared for the worst.
bb1af4b1-8bf5-4f5c-9bab-6c4a9535052a|No one prepared you for this, did they?
8cbc2365-1093-44b8-ba22-3e4fb215c01c|A good thing the press don't know about it.
b64eb61c-d11b-4e6b-8ca1-c5602b95e873|I can't afford this kind of press.
0d708a59-8470-4f0b-9550-9dd24b195bb2|You know what the press will do with this?
ccc7d6a0-bc41-41ac-bd42-46b7f5bed79f|It's even less so a press area.
54919f30-78ce-4361-973f-35ecfe2586e1|Do we have the resources they have?
9b51b686-2ae0-427c-910d-4b59b00ac51a|What resources are you gonna give me?
5302f102-a0f5-4efd-a006-dbfdd6664a6e|I'm here for a job interview with human resources.
a9c36ff8-2fad-4c8c-a8d4-f8e02788cf34|Joan, I have all my available resources on this.
05c8cc66-1cb0-437c-b8b2-1c63de19ca4a|What is this amount for this coffee machine?
b1eb8dce-6b35-4904-9508-f86add47c597|And neither of you paid the full amount?
58254949-b7ba-4096-9c49-c2bd8e3c3939|Okay, well, we don't want to argue with that.
1c9467e5-50e9-4328-946e-e00aef3ae1ab|Isn't that hard to argue with?
516554ef-1e11-421e-b80f-c89b5b19237b|In fact, you could argue it's made things worse.
4f3e6769-d9d0-4068-a6ba-041e20724f21|You know, I can't stand this arguing.
346a1d84-f397-4464-bd46-ae6115d2ba70|You recognize that, don't you?
fe1900d7-cfd1-40ea-ab41-e52c8a2cbda1|You didn't recognize me again?
21e8b92f-37b9-4972-a1a8-989e5afca427|One, do you recognize anyone?
e7f05020-1fad-46ea-a301-5bb5de0541a5|What if I can't recognize my parents?
d62bd150-3369-43f9-ad27-b02f4a4554bb|Because of the treatment John gave me.
86f45538-a5c7-4459-8511-635800db8490|Did he start you on treatment?
954474bf-1fd1-457d-beea-29d1bb9fb4d7|Not what we expected to see after treatment.
d7a3ff04-a2d4-4a5e-95a9-3e5a2fc4298a|Wrong course of treatment could be his last course.
bc6f33ef-e6fd-491d-96b9-7fc3cbdbb26d|That's what happens when you get the proper treatment.
5f80fea8-5ed0-4083-ac85-7858a97e8554|You can only use one hand, your left hand.
b885aebc-e6d0-410d-8bd8-a737840a2f01|He hasn't got much Left to go.
ee424dd1-380a-4ec8-b831-4b7dcc8b35c3|I can't use my left hand at all.
2ee7f341-a8d1-46f7-b670-2d6f4c309deb|And what about your left hand there?
3809d9f1-13a1-406a-ba17-1406aab11ae3|Well, first of all, we're missing a left arm.
65ca3a64-b2fe-4913-bd14-4bf3d3ee6c38|Offer second degree, I'll take it to him.
2874cb19-2586-406a-91c3-ed2e109eb534|You know what you become without a degree?
a991a98a-c6fa-4456-a44d-a3a26690b630|And what is the topic of your degree work?
8da2e7cf-b657-46d7-844c-b4752b7486b0|And that's just what they give degrees in.
e857c6e3-a1ed-4a34-9897-c0a43cd32af3|He had that stocking over his face.
9391cac1-d0a2-4958-9e5d-ba09a20f3516|It's like what Edward says about stocks.
e2b3ce9c-ec10-446b-8f72-7bffc8305417|I just, like, made up a stock name.
46889a83-ff78-4cc5-b270-ccd894131fd4|This is our chance to take stock.
6424e37a-2a49-47f7-a9e7-4aa57b28a2db|There's nothing on it that indicates where she is.
24d16e50-334c-43f3-98b7-2427c1242656|I figured it's time I showed some growth.
5367a3ab-c674-4678-8dea-15713eb9b3b8|Is it about the growth on your tongue?
dc1fcb6c-9b44-44e7-9a5e-9f8a325e7b73|I did mean what I said about growth.
b619d02b-7501-4bf3-8316-49dcfd984541|How many inches of growth can I expect?
d9ad7db1-f4d9-4891-bf42-5a3b855ebe34|We're tracking air quality on plant growth.
eeb98224-cdd8-4ddf-9d01-22cc7ffd31b4|It should be simpler than this, shouldn't it?
0d48608d-9816-4dbf-b754-48e39ea212b5|Okay, this one should be pretty simple.
3c9b311e-d638-44e0-8a12-fa8079170597|We need murder victims, simple as that.
35fc9f38-52a0-4c50-84c6-556d40e0cf43|It was such a simple thing.
4b68eead-3bd8-40f1-958b-9825373e451f|That's about as simple as I can make it.
e6592b01-6379-4b71-887c-a09d8dcaebdf|All these abilities come from one place.
5c07c74b-9563-4154-9cb3-c19a48a5a53d|It gives you the ability to become someone else.
99ade0c1-feb7-450b-ba86-5b7724ad6a7b|It isn't your ability, but mine!
06bd13d4-011f-4a5c-9081-db1450dd07e3|One million dollars for today.
3b386476-786a-4345-b241-69cd55e85152|We'll get our two million dollars back.
c7dc52b8-e52a-45a3-ade9-016e90a229d4|Ten thousand dollars is no small amount.
712e5482-0551-493a-aecb-475a4a57adce|So why did mom pay her a million dollars?
24616007-b49b-4c16-8bd3-cbdbe5addb0f|Four hundred dollars for dinner?
8d8b01a3-d167-4630-b643-f0486290c3e6|He never even passed the union test.
5e8b1c56-a3b7-4737-9919-415d282d41a0|You can't argue with the union.
71b72347-6fd2-421f-8737-aa9c9be3e1b8|Well, he's no friend of the unions.
72e7587a-ac49-409c-a600-fdc9f3254146|There's never been a union without it.
34f3d83d-c7b2-4676-8abf-96cbaf739b34|I showed her the student union.
7c33143b-f286-4158-a9bf-0390064f5dc0|Well, what if he has the disease?
9c3a8a1e-de08-4627-b038-42755a1ee1bf|A disease doesn't decide to kill you.
56960ca3-59cd-4a54-bb8d-011362258aee|Every family has some history of heart disease.
4b653b37-1ad3-4382-ac42-9ff88aee4f87|I thought you played on everybody's team?
b8484b40-4e97-46ee-bb8c-9e9c72c2b7e6|But, of course, everybody knows that.
b28f592c-0ad2-4881-ae65-d723aaa457ee|Okay, so what did everybody make?
31aeba14-dce9-4131-b645-067058a2cad2|Tyler, you get everybody out of here.
946c83f0-eb31-4b2d-b2c9-50e29a344d7c|What will he be like, I wonder?
f760c349-3e0d-42db-81a3-f2b5137a5b3a|I always wondered about my mother.
059aeff9-ffb1-452a-b38a-d543a92f464a|I wonder if we'll ever know.
ce00116f-38d7-4440-b9ae-3731bec48785|What, he's up for election?
b8a9384c-abb0-4c54-9174-e2b0e2f590ed|I have an election in four days.
a6be5ebc-c8f0-4a5d-b22b-350e4b20db89|The price of free and fair elections.
c3e35abc-77d6-4f02-bd76-4256aa16726c|Yeah, that'll win me the election.
77d8ff7a-fcab-461b-bfff-8972d3a5fbe8|The banks got hit for the losses, not people.
68e1e529-e531-4967-bed2-9d5123b7c7ca|You never feel at a loss.
5891d3ed-a084-42d1-be3b-116d747eda60|And I felt sorry for your loss.
ba1c3c50-165f-4c84-b11e-352e422303a3|Even you won't be able to cover the losses.
9957b2f8-1ff0-40cc-8670-43468e48b733|I found this box after she died.
c71c82ba-ac92-44c2-88fb-be61b187708f|Put it back into your lunch box!
1134a5b0-7f17-4c16-9318-92a30e597a18|I did a little boxing in college, you know.
36860a36-f9ff-4383-a0d3-19efbecf42dd|You know what my father said on the box?
79e1787f-d60c-42e8-ad5b-954e7d0d7b32|How did you know about the boxes?
c1bf9b5b-3212-4390-bbe4-3fe659bdcbaf|Well, we have half a deal.
0563665f-6a13-4843-a3d6-68ca914ccd57|You think I don't know about your deals?
973653b4-6ae5-40a5-829c-26cb6096b767|He just asked me what's my deal.
cc9b7533-31fc-4fad-8f13-7e26a53aced3|Everyone deals with it in their own way.
38e22dd7-26df-4642-8fca-558e3f7913ef|I believe a deal can be made.
2386540f-58c4-4237-b1b9-28bde29bffa1|And she was all right, was she, in herself?
ea01ec59-d56a-4b38-8671-495914d31de8|Maybe we should let her speak for herself.
bfe4919e-a179-44e3-a57c-4634c8fb0e7c|She could have pulled it back on herself.
eb55f246-720b-4eca-b67d-ba0e91c83715|They're not gonna pull funding over this.
d6d62aca-ab30-4575-aa93-381f34debb84|I'd bet my entire college fund on it.
5aa8452c-eb8b-405c-ab6c-c1b42248f0c9|My funds are at our local bank.
0d9fcac3-bbac-4842-bf67-4c2b57064afe|It's to raise funds but there'll be music.
ba9cbfab-b2be-4e37-87f5-7a8cb0dc4d55|I didn't miss the best part.
c556fbbb-b806-4385-a926-66111e2ec097|We looked for him when he went missing.
80ffd888-97c9-40c6-be87-269230785ba8|But, Simon, it really looks like there's money missing.
2f2017d4-b30a-443e-a4a8-0af7fbcccb82|But the family hasn't reported him missing.
9cf165a3-ee1d-4d49-9d81-f1b03e49242b|I used to know Carl pretty well.
16ea0cf5-33bf-4fab-bdf3-d04ae9e54463|We should pick them up pretty quickly.
3385a74f-ffd9-41b5-a8f7-be3e4e2ca603|I think this is very pretty.
59585079-4fbd-47fd-b75c-e35e368ec49d|It is a major trading center in the region.
2ccdc30a-3e04-4ec7-a590-718861608117|Yes, I'm from that region.
76dbe111-6611-4232-84f7-c5e4f5dc5834|Instead of, say, some other regions, like most boys?
01bc9f36-b8d0-4918-880a-3e4467f8551f|I don't even want to have feelings!
8219d7ef-09e0-4db5-8e5b-31180e245519|I have a feeling he didn't kill them.
0be80e56-2960-4042-b231-2be105cabc10|I got a feeling this is a good one.
0a8811ff-4477-4c96-b595-052bbcc42989|I don't think feelings can be fixed.
1b5e0834-09bc-4f8e-a386-072cf1538395|Don't hurt your feelings by what you said.
2708c67b-03d3-4548-bd37-edc3b2d98bdc|That's why I was laying low at the hotel.
9939c332-a859-4ecc-98c8-afa7f46db9b5|I saw him laid out.
82af40f1-ac36-4e9b-9cb2-abbdb39d08e8|What does it take to get laid around here?
b3239a61-17aa-487a-b5d5-b6f560208823|You get laid and then you die.
545c94f7-46e2-4e16-b0bc-21913f977c95|And people are laying fingers all over them.
9ee49ff5-51ac-4846-8239-ba14705fd05d|And the ones still in training as well.
df2c7191-9e7f-471e-a9a5-2f01f4364e1e|We've got a training program set up.
d3505b66-beea-4680-9882-8656dae2fe7e|The killer in that one had military training.
3b6bb2e6-5916-43e6-8405-5eb876d7c61b|Just tell her that I can keep training.
569580f8-27a7-4d47-9950-a606e8fd7f38|I'm not training you to be like someone else.
08792812-d249-45ba-8f45-4446bc6e4ab1|Where do you think I'm training you for?
fbd86bec-2afa-4097-a57b-f0e1402a3270|But I think you should start training from tomorrow.
6438d905-279a-4f49-8db6-65739224942b|You and Tommy are training together?
d78d6bd0-a64a-4593-b8e2-badc41e1114d|I thought you were training all day.
06f55d0d-188b-4936-b88d-a652c69966c4|Any message if he comes back?
441e95fe-de09-4274-bf1c-3938c5bfae0d|I'm leaving another message for Emma.
a602e953-5b0a-4aad-9a89-6d90ca702f2f|I left a message in case.
a7d87c68-19cc-4752-af6e-8998c4574574|Oh, I'll give her the message.
9ec6a1e6-0606-4cd4-b47a-72360b5a6c1e|He didn't answer so I left a message.
1f8ad528-792a-41b3-a6e3-1e5f851bb0a2|I am sure she will be arriving any moment.
0615cb71-5ba6-42a8-8bae-28f8b767c01f|I'm under orders not to say until we arrive.
be6d1f54-4370-49dc-948a-bddf83db954a|We'll call you when it arrives.
99074cb1-af81-4850-af01-a338d80d1d92|Something just arrived from New York for you.
2f2d5a15-2b81-4912-a1a8-4047ae1c7a8f|He immediately began About Beth when we arrived.
47d4e890-ca1c-429d-a82d-89c8f63444f4|That's the new standard of police work?
9646e08a-7995-41ae-96a6-3aa4fbf016d2|They're gonna demand a certain standard.
ddcd6f89-8aa9-46ae-a0af-c887fc2ab76d|I mean, even by New York standards.
19402164-bff0-45a9-86e2-373aa5d48015|Why were you outside my room?
50716ca2-06cf-4795-841d-156fce47eded|When you walk outside watch your back.
ca855a4e-0aad-4716-9566-dd3f7b8d165a|It's easier to talk outside the office.
9665e5a1-7034-4824-9e0c-d44a580633bf|I tried to kill her but I failed.
0d001d6a-2189-41d9-b9d9-8404904918ef|If we stop following them, they've failed.
bc4839c1-d80c-419a-a225-9d83f51faf5b|You realize she's setting you up to fail.
6a12ad3d-50e2-4a5c-88a3-c52c795649e4|This body may fail, but I will not!
c6f44c78-ceeb-4f44-b036-5658a8c94c43|This is what happens when we fail.
13bd1651-a7d1-4832-b852-8c31f0aa1721|You tell her we gonna make a trade.
e8eace88-4562-4e30-8671-e2f9ce3c9ff1|Come on, I already made the trade.
d38ae9bc-61e2-4bb0-8ef9-719256f82da0|But I think it's a pretty fair trade.
2130f6c4-b7c5-479a-b41f-bfc01272b5e5|Oh, turn in or trade in?
b6074351-a713-4ffc-a344-8d65e744f1ff|They don't like the staff to use the pool.
9166a949-0ffe-4d19-a023-359806cc9050|All you have to cover is bar and staff.
23f745b8-11b2-44ed-a70a-7df8417ad99f|We think it was from the cleaning staff.
5675a53a-fe9c-48de-aac7-64a895dcdbc2|I was a younger member of the staff.
58cbff8c-e9be-46de-8907-646730e10556|No staff by that name.
2d048d01-7558-452e-ac94-5d81bc283b32|My parents are gonna go to this benefit.
5d084db6-c969-44cc-9397-5faf9f863915|We're nothing more than enemies with benefits.
1c722327-cd63-4e87-bb46-be987b34ccf5|It was all a show for my benefit.
59aef173-bdf2-408c-b0ee-8045880a0317|I may have some good news about your benefits.
c14d67bf-a401-4923-a1b0-75f797879b7c|Oh, but I'm invested in the characters.
5a887224-aa87-446d-b025-1a51cd41a160|I just need a moment to get into character.
7eb1e2ff-6f09-422d-b88b-75e7b13e9eff|You got to stay in character.
19e6e1a4-3766-41d9-96d1-8d294af66b0a|All right, who the hell's this character you're doing?
c607beea-221b-4e82-83fc-89a8413a9561|You don't have any character.
27d43f6c-a562-420f-9429-c0d94056958e|I think it's another kind of army.
4d222d4d-f604-429c-92ec-6ad5239a2e23|But you said you was the army.
750160b6-47e6-42cd-a358-7ba9f9cf3224|What army is this, may I ask?
62a56099-41ed-4413-aece-55a3d87f1d6f|But this war isn't just between armies.
82ee2a58-eb62-40fc-937e-b93e78d79135|He's got an army around him.
26459532-3448-4608-b199-62933fdbff7c|You have to do the operation here.
7fa96249-f3e4-4076-ba67-ab500836340c|This doesn't seem like a very big operation.
a6d9d65b-e87e-42e0-ba26-88293f38a2a4|So, last night, you were having an operation?
8706b172-d02d-487e-aaba-37d319dfaf9b|What we have is an operation in progress.
27fc53d1-5694-4716-9918-9d5063a33a53|And to present you with proof of my worth.
1d76376e-a1f6-4444-a0d5-c80f4a2a3834|Now I am presenting you with this.
db45a7e0-0d6a-4d35-8494-56eec2917989|I will now present your wife.
b21d6612-05b0-4c28-9a46-e7fef09892a6|The evidence will now be presented.
66230109-4bd6-4a00-a621-d6423ec5a202|You don't like something, it's not a crime.
ad8f4b3c-6c8c-4d2e-b30a-d8eb69130be0|When my only crime is opposing him.
3e117cf2-bae1-4619-a9bc-cefc4e238d22|And if you read it, that's a crime.
c4315c03-7de6-4b18-b40a-be07e504e525|That's a crime according to my law.
1cd9e267-a134-47c3-ae3b-6b1ea413dcb4|We have a possible crime scene.
8934d6bf-a11d-41f4-94c0-530e3b6551a6|All your friends are named Patrick!
a1dcec73-1f5f-4c19-938d-409c67b3b760|And what did you name it?
e06f5acb-3127-4e0d-9817-b79e1b1070a1|Name of his cat is Albert.
cd6e5963-c2b6-4fc3-a28e-da77881b8fdc|I'm looking for a guy named Bobby.
f61a11a2-ce7e-4b24-8394-d09047bdf85a|We never used to have a cup.
a89b77c8-2f0d-4c50-83a5-f3935954ce48|It puts way too much in the cups.
d20d4ae6-fec7-45d8-a6fa-df095c440d39|I've known everyone on this island my whole life.
7a91a40d-d14f-4633-8bbe-f1ab499f7e3c|He says he found it on the island.
3be36c74-d590-4380-8a8b-2ab691189bea|Do you still think you're an island?
aa999d0c-e097-429c-be44-6135e111249d|This was my way off the island.
0f059c62-334c-493a-a122-05f6d8b680a5|I'm just trying to get people off the island.
5268217c-15d3-4e68-9384-bc901007b67a|Now, I've prepared an analysis report for you.
efe592b4-ee06-463a-9fcc-3d55fb12a047|I want all her clothes brought in for analysis.
2d1e9450-56d8-4eee-9d62-c9386f80b676|Send it over for voice analysis.
9e4196f8-f22b-4783-87b0-65888524debb|And how long will it take for the analysis?
3fd61bc0-55f2-4eb9-9fb1-5c32c46d6b12|I was just checking something out for a friend.
cb49a03c-70df-4563-b0aa-e021bf6b9eb6|But check it out, I saw him today.
3bf1b579-c160-43fb-bc7c-5e36cc4cae77|Joe wanted me to check in, you know?
cf0dd430-ba92-4bda-8cd1-db591a949052|I told you to check on him.
0fccdea3-7229-43d4-8e2d-e9b97980b716|Should I check you out?
6029a2fd-3198-441f-9061-26f71ccaea11|I'm learning not to answer questions like that.
c5bdfb72-e12b-4839-92fd-66573e8d6a4e|I can never answer what she wants.
a8930ccb-6721-4e96-9e5f-e4e1185bb470|That's a question only you can answer.
bdc9f813-9d83-4fc1-a834-00578d2a742a|I don't answer that question.
8dd7b9bd-e1e1-41ce-8c9a-a33bbfa40c22|I don't answer to you, all right?
e605cce5-03bf-4267-a941-4fabd28dc6f3|What about this third photograph?
d784fe49-d7d6-4efd-8395-db7fcb955b63|I hope there's no glass in the food.
fd54dbce-a57d-4791-8bbb-eab63b9922e7|What's with all the broken glass?
990560ed-c77f-4dfe-8a91-4cbd1ba7cf25|Take a look at what's inside the guy's glass.
656b7611-93dd-4f5a-b893-189ced20ce9b|Why don't you have a glass with me?
bc5ec016-4a30-442b-ac0a-f5e5852f5310|And he's not only standing, he's moving forward.
6b76e042-3052-4a54-919b-8643df367b0c|We've been looking forward to it for months!
0999594a-aa36-488c-90d7-5ae526504e46|But I've had something to look forward to.
8ac62c6b-e2a2-4ac1-b787-5e40fc942b76|You had no authority to order this attack!
b0a9e910-49b5-480b-92af-1aed4c4ac816|Sir, we cannot let her contact the authorities.
5e07f9a9-5fc6-4901-8990-d40d71660ce2|You have no authority in this matter.
14a512ef-91a1-41bd-b009-1b6d8ab85d72|What authority do you have to do this?
3063c5a5-68c3-4028-81eb-0a02212a54f9|You and no one else on earth.
4db59a95-f73d-46fb-b299-14699fa1efbc|And what on earth can that be?
e28a32cb-3e6d-4808-a479-f0a3ffb44b01|Why on earth would you do something like that?
916f9c86-551a-41a1-b958-5bd4478d0224|How on earth would you know it?
32ae37fc-91ba-4b0c-8f70-96edd8ba028a|How on Earth did you find me?
3f8df865-9756-4021-9e9f-93602f1ba535|Perhaps one day, we can get back to Earth.
be4cd862-e405-4ba8-81b5-864bd5f14a39|How on Earth did you notice all that?
76778d67-ee2c-494c-b763-f037b6802788|Doesn't smell like anything on Earth.
8ec0eb32-ba97-43ff-8614-88911a74dd77|And the next stage is you moving away.
ecca84d1-db64-4edb-8332-ba9980213f38|I haven't been on stage in years.
40918909-2319-4012-af02-e90481963f7f|But hasn't everybody at some stage?
b199c027-ad16-44e6-9224-b7f082a955da|You don't want to stay on the stage?
57d9d480-6817-4553-b51a-375f5af70af1|And we're the ones that are running things now.
af2c853c-8acf-41ee-a3ac-6e4d7164dd79|More like the one who broke up my family.
ee9f8d7d-f099-41f2-b788-25f04ec0f9e2|All right, make sure no one sees her.
badb73ff-b383-4123-b385-bf23da52ad5c|I know no one said that I did.
137a6d6e-3120-4012-a0d6-fdb78150c41f|I'm the one who turned you in, Karen.
66a141fe-8edf-43b2-8450-44ca7c8b16a1|And, for the first time, she's acting like it.
ebd95e59-bf8a-46d1-8629-1715f922358e|Yeah, well, of course I acted.
92663c35-fd7e-4cd8-9cd1-30148e7f042b|Don't act like you can't hear me.
954a5f62-6f8e-4c24-af69-3757c318a201|We have to act like we believe it.
1eab2792-7d0a-4bcf-920b-acb142178703|We can sort this out later.
cb7f00b3-1c10-47a5-a195-5eef3cbbcdc6|I sort of agree with him.
df315b04-a9dd-4c7b-9e4a-8b7cff88f0b4|They want to tie up the Moscow station.
0696debf-cfd3-4db3-b64f-b89bd997f76b|This used to be the police station.
ec4e20a2-79a6-4d1f-bef3-e6c54a6825c5|I tried calling the station house for you.
31c6d310-f03a-46d0-ad42-0940f58d3e21|Well, clearly, they are not alone.
b9a5525d-10bc-49e2-a89c-d76707c80f0c|I remember you less and less clearly.
e3057a57-45bc-4531-8f34-9258acb9b8c0|And we clearly get along really well.
22fb1ad4-46ba-4853-ac35-4ddfc17a158e|Explain it clearly or you can't leave!
c6acc524-87ab-476d-8f4f-4a4bc366a4aa|Oh, I see things very clearly.
7a251625-4d61-40d8-a3d8-d470b77b1507|It was very compared of year.
8b34c905-b9b0-441c-adcc-4bbd0a93897e|I'm saying that he is, compared to you!
c98a20c7-f679-4bdc-92d9-ccf76c70300a|Don't compare my dad to your cat.
e0fc1230-e6db-4d36-b826-114e9ba659f1|Why are you always comparing things to balls?
fc03ee60-a94e-4e2c-934a-9c7978c21245|I know them both very well indeed.
5288c7a8-87c3-4a15-a767-c6d030e4a3c7|You are indeed alone now.
ec08478a-50e5-4101-9c7e-1955f37a62b1|Indeed, whether you have one at all.
73535303-248d-4f1a-8c96-c484d11adacd|Oh, indeed, I think you will.
538791d7-9cff-4fe2-aea3-a6ae032f8651|Then indeed, how shall a man know?
2ce5d253-5fe9-4436-8c82-ac58fb464a58|The public wouldn't want it any other way.
0b451152-4791-4de7-ba57-65faa9822193|Because she doesn't trust you with the public.
9c318f27-7bdb-4fe5-918c-37ed6a411b1d|No, not, he is too much public.
0bed9a72-4921-4632-a741-c98819ab9e8f|Which means no more drinking wine in public.
c25eba2b-f1dc-4bf9-a73d-f5303bd7bda0|This room's off limits to the general public.
1cc06f0b-c466-45f1-a414-59ef30d2247c|Is that the knowledge that you fear?
384262d7-1d8b-4e67-b400-47db0b98e16f|To my knowledge, I lost my young hot head.
63ceb3b3-9084-4770-81a5-7fd4d049f53d|Did you not get my letter stating my intentions?
5e83cb63-1cbf-4c69-8038-8a3d154f96d6|She stated that you weren't the target.
0183cc98-f313-40be-9dcd-55abb5d0a508|The importance of this moment cannot be over stated.
27162038-34b6-4c55-800e-db265c89b4ce|So, perhaps just state your name and age.
75c79062-9111-4c41-ad39-caa679c55c16|I don't see the value in stating the obvious.
c6ad5b7a-291b-42d9-8562-10f976b3dff3|Where do you go when the stars go blue.
97304e18-920b-4641-94e5-aad257d1abe7|Maybe blue flowers on the front?
fc86f788-1c7c-4d81-a78e-b6040cefc2f8|Oh, well, actually, I am feeling really blue.
2eddcb22-f305-4aa2-8c18-da9638c9516c|I'm supposed to set a good example.
36b1a647-99a5-45cf-a769-740a195adcd5|That guy needed to be made an example of.
62ce9c60-cca6-477d-acc3-c3dfd7069c58|In our dreams for example.
ba157f6e-6ba0-48be-8b38-376cbc352c55|I'd have us set an example.
c0ea47de-8ccc-4edf-b72f-705f3672269a|Can you give me some examples?
5d2571f8-78be-42ec-8aee-eb81a62bf663|Is that strategy working in the war on drugs?
9cd2c4e3-d549-4b27-a427-4e467b34b686|Then, the strategy will work, sir?
e3a78851-64e2-489d-af4e-4e27c7f36b73|He laid out their strategy.
aaea2876-fea7-4a45-b617-55aaef3b7cb6|My strategy was giving them Japanese names.
d59da90e-31e7-4690-85bb-821cedc645d9|I can't sleep at night in the mountains.
bc560c45-6939-443e-89d4-5efa852019d4|That mountain air is nice.
7848736d-71fd-426b-9087-5c1637022158|How do you tell they're mountains?
daa7fcd1-e508-4d98-815a-5ae1c896a1d7|Well, I guess you're a hard guy to leave.
2e8d58fe-5d5a-4a2d-8429-bb86337a1955|Guess I should get back in there.
fd5b80a7-f5b0-431a-a36c-89720d4fedca|I guess you showed them.
9f0b771f-b15d-4640-948e-d7a58d2108f9|Guess we don't have a choice, do we?
2fb5d35c-c126-4f8f-b4ab-e4b15a6a5591|I guess they didn't make it.
b27de87d-aaee-4f13-ba54-dbcd2aa8bc7c|A sister, a whole family you know nothing about.
e5929a50-e29f-44a1-a4a0-160467e2e226|And you must stay until your sister is recovered.
7243647b-805a-4e9c-be6a-bf450d761689|I saw what you're doing to my sister!
632fd5b6-ec7f-4f8a-82f1-15a4e1a6aa4c|My kid sister used to have one.
bc02fea9-32aa-4786-98a5-a62e71c89f19|I wouldn't want my sister there.
5cda6421-775d-4a7e-a771-3d1de9a1e18d|This way, he's forced you to drink his blood.
228d18f5-db44-4273-8a1e-66f5b8adbb75|No one is forcing me to do anything.
bdb596f9-c3e8-40f7-8173-e20242905303|They can not force you to work for them.
a8576944-477b-471a-8786-ee1d897ec844|Maybe a gun dealer or something like that?
751e63b5-11d3-437e-a543-685a5fbb9af9|How would he have known where the gun was?
38042088-02b0-45cf-8aba-2856f609d3e5|Why would he give me a gun?
6e2333ea-517a-4831-8e66-b5234ad0688a|Casey, you have, you have to take the gun.
59b05a7e-4d6b-4e0b-82e7-7810652497bf|Sally's various growing pains, and the loss of Paul.
853a77b4-a43f-4a3e-a494-0c34297345de|Like I said, we used various accounts.
79ac3760-9338-4188-ad46-b1c8a38debc7|Yeah, your name has come up in various ways.
77ca5b6f-5b77-4cd4-addc-0f9dd751eb11|What are you laughing about, Charlie?
d11c1821-8edf-4929-8dd3-c10721ee9925|Why didn't you laugh at me?
0ab99916-dae2-4772-b93f-1006f228d84c|What do you think I'm laughing at?
69b0262f-3972-498d-9eef-91306ff4d790|Nothing he hated worse than being laughed at.
7e5f8261-d734-439b-a939-9cbd2ca0ce9e|It got us here, laughing about it.
25a507a8-14bf-4a69-8608-6cc06d6851fe|I wrote your reports, I finished your designs.
f1914476-6040-43c4-bdc8-0967de30a6b0|It has a design fault, then.
36968b59-89ef-4e46-9acb-e9a8f58ddc22|Is that one of your designs?
910dc71c-c810-40c0-9453-ed9de3c31eb0|There is no sun in this room.
d935daef-30ca-468f-85f7-66117112f951|The sun is coming through the window.
41e36b0b-2f6d-4f0e-8706-c45c34b1c8d7|It's just from being in the sun all day.
7d4ea85f-6ad1-4786-b66e-9f6f43c28fa0|He got himself a pretty good lawyer.
646f3ff5-51b2-48c2-8a11-8673fc4e33b9|How much money you got for a lawyer?
05c28169-8212-4570-b6ab-f7694e06c315|You mean have sex with him.
02f8dd32-70b7-40f2-b797-29586d7ba0b3|They know we know it means they're having sex.
8ef88fb1-8996-456a-ab28-11e6e1086c73|We had beautiful, beautiful sex.
cc7b8944-b74c-49fa-bbd5-c87eecb3650a|If it's about Chuck, I'd rather not know.
4e3ed4bb-5d9f-49c8-8c32-48523cf077ae|I'd much rather be with your mother.
e43d0025-e4de-4014-b35b-b9cb2ab39261|He looks rather like me, I suppose.
e49f7876-2f8f-4e02-b23b-10ec5710ada7|I rather think it does.
0f57b029-2fae-42e9-a995-a1d88b70130a|I know what I'd rather look at.
c80a933f-595d-4909-ae65-e89a1b29dd2e|Yeah, she's like, some famous artist.
fd59108e-de29-4f83-8c58-6e32cd9c94ec|When will they protect artists?
f08aa65a-31c9-49e2-a95c-c8d397e0f28b|Would you be, like, an artist?
2a2a546a-cd8f-4ee0-8e72-638a17d6be2a|These artists never stop seeking and dreaming.
be4db3fd-a124-4683-b6a0-928d98b69543|Have I seen you in the club before?
430a6bc1-cd40-40da-9a2b-1cb1863d9793|Mike said we're going to a club.
117eab5b-b89e-47e3-8cc8-fcedfc8428ca|My club wants me dead.
dfd307b8-5e5a-481f-ac4c-80423798bed2|Right before you could prove it.
9cd9a4f6-86b9-4d34-80df-bdab93e21fa7|He doesn't care if he can prove it.
57fdeb48-aa01-471a-bfba-0838fc1842ba|Well, that proves that she works for them.
20ca3726-6daf-4e99-af76-edc9472c6d75|They can't prove I did anything wrong.
d7dae47e-83f9-48db-a678-bc06a6a0a020|The fact that I'm still alive proves it.
2f63fef3-c17e-4835-88de-634adb24820c|Yeah, all we need is a section of it.
7471f3d5-023c-4cec-9feb-c3a74cd1052e|I've got one final section left to study.
02b99ede-b440-44b2-909c-124c049858a0|I can't leave the section now.
6f271159-7f2d-413d-bb2a-986542307917|Where do you think I got my skills?
acb15dd6-a3b4-4e6d-a416-d3ece6bba37c|Did you tell him the truth?
2ad6266d-0eaf-4126-8ade-94a8e882b205|Well, if he's telling the truth we can.
5545e2cf-ab6f-465a-9066-f7f03ef4b188|But what if we're not ready for the truth?
7b94dcea-1dd8-4307-8c07-2bccaf5ef5e4|Ask me anything, I will tell you the truth.
69914097-0e7e-4aa8-805c-75044b7228e3|But you didn't tell the whole truth.
77acc3fe-115a-4549-8f96-b39df9aec7bc|Soon I'll have the whole set.
da0b9e16-2e16-46b8-80f0-915fb598cc0c|No, that's not in my skill set.
866a77f4-7564-4a1d-9b8f-7efa5cc2cf1b|You got some set of balls calling me here.
5effceda-a1af-443d-be76-f90485b28b4c|I could use a second set of eyes.
9af55dd1-c162-4ad1-9d17-b296fbd0afef|It is very emotional right now on the set.
2993df26-3502-46ad-937b-02526eb92bc1|Oh, ok, so he's a little pretty.
904fd3b5-910c-4979-8151-3e8ce14dcc02|Look after him, it's ok now.
80ea735d-f8ff-4352-bf20-97842c87335d|It'll be ok, my love.
2215af83-cbaf-480a-a375-e2be328fe445|Do I need to call my manager?
959f1a41-49ff-4a56-b549-9cdebec54741|I'm having trouble getting my manager.
c2ed5536-109f-455b-b9cd-b501d584448f|What are you, her manager?
07279563-b705-45da-bb86-1d6b2c57de88|In the manager's office, I imagine.
ae5811b9-9908-4568-9b1a-d01ebc3108af|It is not a district that matters.
9838c69f-b936-473e-8970-06ae2b9c8417|Because I live in this district, too.
c0b847da-06fc-47c2-9f0f-f7b20bc75ead|Sure, why don't you come by the district?
9eb2e7d9-d747-4ca8-88e3-ad16fd7ee207|My family heard that Francis has claimed my son.
1bc8606d-c5b0-49b3-99ef-fb17a5c02e2c|I've never claimed to be one.
dc7cb0f3-acda-4ebb-b6a1-d388e6d82079|Maybe she was exactly who she claimed to be.
da6994a6-caa5-440b-8965-cdfd9cfae1a4|I don't claim to know the answer.
ba15a9f3-3be0-46fd-acff-8a59ddd1c2ac|You always forget at least one.
46bf993b-4315-4893-a786-d71097853ed1|No, you don't have that yet, forget that.
06c84398-4a69-4dcd-aae9-1fe7b57bfcab|Maybe it's not such a bad thing to forget.
20cf0202-030a-4f28-b73f-d9cc00ba9e46|I'm just got hung up at work.
ac27fab9-d03d-4d03-b905-4f771797fd1d|He's gonna think I hung up on him.
41a12e68-9669-4527-bff0-670ba207e84a|I've been with you the entire time.
27393d3e-0d50-4eb8-b7f4-514e7d928c1b|No one spoke the entire time.
28d7bc61-2b53-4f76-af4d-60e95a76c0ea|It's the only entire print out there.
59fb04ed-ee21-43f0-98c6-60f668b15eb1|Did he watch her the entire night?
861aac94-e4e6-4ebe-8cb0-9dcf85feefde|Tell me about your legs.
d78a7e0c-db2b-43fd-af9b-14731effb655|Am I not your arms and your legs?
432f2ea6-66fa-4cd6-95c4-a6f0444ffb23|I'll shoot you in the leg.
977278a1-4718-46f5-b056-9e9df7bd05fe|The legs make the hands go up.
d8850d21-8159-4b05-a366-4ebdb3070e7e|Yeah, but you've got the legs.
f1681db4-df63-44df-aad4-53e6322d50f0|And that's enough for him.
8cc2506e-1668-411b-89e4-b89b461d57f7|Maybe you didn't try hard enough.
64372a77-9177-459a-94f5-579964b39a03|You can't steal what was designed to be free.
53c58943-e8a4-4bfc-b0b8-151a7666d9e5|I dreamt to design planes too.
a3134607-23c7-478f-b03e-988ea5795ad5|Well, you know, as close as she could.
79688c80-084e-4686-8f71-02480f9bfc66|I mean, she was closest to him.
cf894eca-4af5-4458-b01c-819bf95f16da|I couldn't even find any close friends.
be8272d7-ffc5-47fe-a648-8b8e894414b5|Your children study natural science?
c752af7e-f81a-43b6-825d-fdb354e04446|She could have studied anything she wanted.
63626c4e-37f5-4748-a3bd-ae8aa5f726ba|Studying murder often brings out the best in people.
f9bb6ebd-fe92-4241-958a-fee2ef8656de|Have you established the cause of death?
011bb826-81fd-4694-8742-96e99bdd5757|I thought we already established I'm not that man.
088c1ea5-9b9a-4527-b256-a0516f32d5b5|That should have been established by your attorney.
f129fa42-a453-4c1a-82d3-55e5633bca9a|The reason was his heart was removed.
658b8150-ea77-4908-b0ee-1f3d1ddc49d6|What happens if we remove it?
749eb9f5-7b6e-4af6-afed-9191ffd98832|And now we'd like you to remove mine.
106d7746-cecf-4657-a5d8-a565aef9f5e8|Then what was the main one?
f5143648-c1b6-4014-85e7-b806c363872f|We better stay away from the main road.
e288cf45-2525-4044-81e9-e5226de6914f|Walking down the main street, so everyone can see.
6ebe12f8-f034-45ee-b762-1e440054edfc|You think it was my professor?
08b5c622-a80b-4650-a8d3-71dbd7d5140c|I'll show the professor out, and I'll call you.
ff9fe665-ec8f-4ec9-9fdd-c771fa8c9554|When do you think this could happen, professor?
400dd7c1-1157-469f-9201-8b59d10d4715|Some become professors like their parents.
424d6bfd-92c5-4dcd-8d9f-d1cbef401bec|I thought it was a simple financial thing.
7507d767-3c09-4bc8-a591-36fd00dba673|But there's financial matters that have to be settled.
666dd28e-ca1f-49dd-b167-a0baf848430b|This one works in financial district.
096635a3-6999-4825-bf84-223928c98e8e|Which I have no financial interest in.
e3342713-73df-4592-909e-5995b6bc93dc|We enjoyed it pretty good over all.
67f3e719-4919-4ebe-b360-1e2e9c9b5897|I hope you enjoy hell.
2fb0746b-cebd-4930-bfe9-b4a128d18570|Oh, I'm gonna enjoy killing you.
59d23d66-4bb9-4c81-acf5-8ba99bfed4f9|Oh, did you enjoy it?
5781c36b-03c7-4951-8745-ce0e47868e99|I can't believe the network's gonna be there.
3c7dd43c-6b43-4afd-9e4e-d1a89fd05041|Sounds like a pretty big change, don't you think?
c6e10fc8-c567-49c2-b05c-d2c36261b9ec|You know, you sound real crazy right now.
36ff7ddc-76d8-4f22-8b9d-8b34737b126c|That doesn't sound a lot like Morgan, does it?
1d4313f0-0678-4574-87fe-df24300e04a8|The future doesn't sound so bad.
ca03599e-f3cb-45a2-a84d-3c2ab5dd32bf|And it's worse than it sounds.
fbb24755-9427-4cc2-9728-89140d1942b3|I can't discuss this now.
c075d280-404d-4709-802a-c00200e7cbcb|Maybe they're discussing the marriage of Sir and Lily.
3e016768-3ee5-46d0-99d6-221a96d4ab22|They don't want to discuss it on the phone.
d6394ef2-dd49-4701-bc90-526b97a019bb|It seems you two have formed an alliance.
cf137434-8ab5-4f55-bb0d-5f179fdfaa19|We need him for the final job.
f539cada-f73e-426d-97e2-0948cb944518|He's gone, and I'm in the final four.
dbe94960-e5b2-47c2-b0b7-4f587e7b815e|I'm gonna be sick in my final surgery.
3bc51c34-a30d-45c6-935e-7c1e7ee0b1d1|I'm sorry, but the decision is final.
dc13d1a4-2cf3-4770-a2f8-183f7e60fa5e|His trial is set for eight weeks from now.
5d1d4e3a-de07-4313-b99a-cf6a0721985a|It is important to remember who is on trial.
f3ea863d-df4f-42f1-8a9d-f1e948447310|Max, I am not doing a drug trial.
4491cf69-2a6a-4dbf-b4f9-c48d36045bc4|And he has no legal address.
bb82398e-6478-4fcb-8595-300c837608b7|How are these things legal?
bdd6c85c-d740-4a28-87f3-8f4552525dd3|And I can give you that legal right.
01634e4a-3acd-427d-b6f6-45a5bcc0110b|I don't think this is legal.
30fcadae-f5dd-4a4b-be29-4178b402fb8c|We don't have legal cause.
6beba9aa-701e-4918-bbf4-db55e23e4aae|Maybe he had some special help.
408afa6a-c070-4715-a6e8-4028a163e66d|Then I'll find him without your help.
241a5ffd-1ba3-44b0-a22e-6d124be5180f|He doesn't want my help.
16827cf9-5079-48d6-86fb-0ac9b8a5acc6|With your help, don't forget.
f1e3e5ff-1101-4bea-b0f4-f956d9959cf7|I just needed to get help.
24f55e15-4129-4cc5-a6d8-0b14a3223e5b|It is too cold here.
8183460f-10d6-4e9c-b064-01aa128cc6e2|Yes, it is certainly not a cold.
0fefbab3-7ac5-425d-93e8-66d5dbacecad|You shot her in cold blood!
b84aaff6-05e5-4ad4-9541-a9eba32c3ad4|It is above eight months at least.
bb4ceb44-16b2-468b-95be-ee5b61294e37|Do not think you stand above me.
1b1e74c2-d0c2-4909-9444-0d3521863613|You're so far ahead of me and above me.
8362f48d-ccf9-4903-b02c-4dd11834b4b6|Not that she was above it herself.
b0380626-e0e1-4f01-b0e6-27a80e21d28c|Oh, man, this is above and beyond.
5a26a031-d937-4f39-a209-db83f64c1eb7|He was shot three times from above.
a2b5290e-454d-4b0a-8dd1-24579e0e4bcc|It is signed from above.
d212cc31-6499-4e96-9ada-05104d0cf4bb|Caused by the rocks in the river?
dd291ad6-ad66-4d32-bb58-96a18e2e6550|I remembered where I saw that rock.
86be30bb-2f1c-40af-9cf6-e26ac14a0e42|He got beaten with a rock.
5c969e46-a751-4a2e-8b5e-83e70ea2c48d|Oh, I'll grant you that.
9744cdc5-081f-4b70-aeb0-d170906dff8e|I guess that finishes that.
a1a44165-c475-4ace-9c83-72c08db39adc|He even let her sit in his special seat.
dedc718b-e981-434d-93eb-5f89d2013b45|Would you like to take a seat over there?
4bd4de96-18fb-4173-bb93-483896a43b14|Go back to your seat quickly!
a3784083-7387-42af-a0d1-0842e9fd61c4|Better get something for those seats.
b42d1897-201f-4762-83a0-1530c0695685|Just sign in and have a seat.
c93246ae-9157-4159-a0a4-842516afe03f|This is the weapon I seek.
ebf5034f-8f16-48cf-8479-e80a17cc9262|Good call, checking for a second weapon.
a48e24ea-552f-4dcc-a874-215f1e4b9bd0|And he used a weapon just like this one.
86811a06-ecff-4eda-a745-ca910fdbaaab|Or if you used it as a weapon.
c0975f76-bbef-42d6-9a3a-4fb16724d90b|And I'd never held a weapon.
e79de828-6aa4-4467-9bb0-2e3d5d2a82f3|Any songs telling you anything about that?
6ac095b2-de31-4423-87bf-9bd8bf4e1c9a|It's the song you asked about.
e1e9d2a8-79fd-4653-a15c-cd0575f41c94|Just the way you are is a great song.
9dba42d1-1fc3-4455-af34-12843a192ef1|Oh, these women are experts.
82aaed5a-23a0-4492-9944-9b105a0954b7|I don't know, you guys are the experts.
4362d147-4c5a-40bb-b87d-c8f63d947cb9|We need an expert in here.
4d33422b-507a-4fe2-b189-7aafdcfba160|Who needs the radio when you got the Internet?
129f11ce-bfaa-46bd-937a-3082af3b467f|You wouldn't be sitting here listening to the radio.
7cd9c4e3-abcb-49f0-9013-57dc1e5ee090|Think I'll go over to the radio station.
c2615d91-bd72-4179-807a-87d892b5b4a5|What a great idea for a radio show.
2ea002e7-29b0-49da-bd2d-c80982bb8b8a|Don't walk you to this nice woman's car?
827e6098-572e-4e4f-8287-be1199e7ef76|I have found a nice family to live with.
fae21865-0d74-44f8-8133-d272a46de6aa|We need to make you look all nice.
f774695e-d628-45cf-a640-a24f53cfa8a4|No, that's exactly what I want to avoid.
05d93d41-a392-4878-b0d6-90bd906e610c|He's avoided getting blood on himself up to now.
4e2fa390-e4f9-487d-a281-152b010e6af9|And it's too late to avoid, as well.
cdaaa919-9c64-44ed-adc9-ed6deba9a492|You guys don't have to keep avoiding me.
104974ee-4c5e-4192-8e02-f3021165ed35|We're just trying to avoid it.
bf2fce96-64cb-42c8-bf1a-cd1f9bec8256|Do you think my memory is coming back?
31976053-3a24-4c07-b159-778dbc2a6e58|The answer is in your memory of that day.
4e1e71f1-bd53-4bed-9302-662c929d6cab|Do you have any problems making new memories?
c89d31bd-ee9d-459c-a3a3-9967d2e520c7|I hear you're in charge now.
ff4ddbdd-7a16-48af-846e-e9cfd59c7864|He was up on charges two years ago.
ce4ad4e5-e95e-4d48-a680-22a0b729c1ac|What would you do if you were in charge?
d3b684db-bc5b-4469-94a4-2937b914db09|It's not good now, in spring.
6d7a164a-e4d3-4e9f-aab4-dfa4cd7d646c|How's your first college spring break so far?
d553bb58-3c3e-4b0f-8291-fec9147574e2|But I have spring break.
f1981255-4774-4a57-acc8-cb1c150010da|We're gonna go looking for hot springs.
9a5f9fbb-95a9-43b7-8432-c20ad2f6c646|You can't read someone else's card.
ef909de9-2ec4-4d0f-89ee-41e01c455fe8|It's the last card on the table for me!
111e7426-5b9b-4b61-93e1-558b5ea26b33|You've been reading books rather than playing cards.
d9688bca-0b6c-4b56-9570-1c0944ecebaa|We can play cards if you like.
d0918d29-3ea5-42f2-af59-111f516d1b72|That's why you keep playing the mother card.
64af9ff8-7c91-4964-8823-3fa7e113ce3c|He maintains he didn't kill her.
33594e4a-b2a8-480f-a9e7-e132ffa3e39c|That is what they maintain.
3d1df1ba-2b4f-41e8-bb70-8bca6b56ca38|The cars won't need to be maintained as much.
1490cced-23fc-4412-a25a-9a1a2e1bace4|You have a theory about that?
00365fa7-c0ca-4644-b50a-81c6604b8d5d|I think you're testing the wrong theory.
da9b9d35-638b-4907-979f-3b242d8d9f3f|She tells the victim's stories, different theories.
243b2c38-3d37-4f47-87b9-cc1976bc31cf|Look, I don't care who hung themselves where.
d6a9e064-7c61-4d26-a29e-79670d41d892|I don't care how many books he sells.
ba78bbd1-f3a8-4343-bb07-550deafa7628|All I care about is what you do.
37c3b4e3-6abf-476b-8e71-ef0201756e51|I don't care about any of that stuff anymore.
9698ca77-2c17-4a51-87ab-f47304bb6ef0|I thought you cared for me just a little.
58cbadf7-3a8c-450b-b7ed-54102044cafe|You stopped my dad from visiting!
d2aa7bcb-024d-4214-b85f-a1e011fcf035|My assistant told me you came to visit.
00063ce3-11fe-4059-aaf5-cdc0227aee4c|How many do we have to visit?
e3182b4e-28e8-4595-a169-ad353d2d7763|You don't like it when I come to visit.
29d64b93-bf57-4851-b7c1-e194db516461|Well, he still visits you out there, right?
93c63540-dfef-44f2-bd86-0d156e33609a|Just imagine what would happen if it is.
11d8fc3e-14c2-419b-a3b0-91c096ac38ef|Can you imagine how many people that is?
d7ec5bd6-3d67-47ab-964d-5b1d45a4af3b|I can only imagine what Jay's going through.
a379bfd9-3953-41d2-8dc6-c82e523f4e7e|I never imagined it would end this way.
388bab37-1517-4715-bf14-3abafbd5ad8e|Imagine your husband or your sister made a mistake.
9755b43a-4a0e-490e-bf74-93d1a925a7e6|I'm going back there when this is finished.
9633586f-6d1e-4503-b1f5-e19d41585f34|I would like to finish and go home.
0af7d84d-b79a-46e3-87e3-f9f3bdb6df51|This is me finishing it.
8dd40b83-3712-4150-86d6-8af3dd84eef4|As soon as I finish making it.
57062946-f74f-4ac5-a6e7-86db4a456bd1|I was watching him when you made your statement.
26e396bc-8846-4067-9ef7-9d02c12e54b9|I will not read this, or any other statement.
0a1f13fb-b490-40f0-9bfa-1d64ed9b922a|Jessica left the firm last month.
4c9caf7e-4fbd-407b-aa18-b11c9d058d09|But for trial, another firm will carry the ball.
0ae8b41d-df6f-4811-878f-4c3b32883289|Because no other business firm would carry your risk.
ad0b5bb6-f157-4b69-b1ac-48166275ba47|It's a huge, huge loss for us.
f3bb594d-08a5-4bda-bd3d-4a9c2a4a30a3|I'm gonna let you in on another huge secret.
1923d273-111a-45f3-bebe-63ff1063b432|We both could have made a huge mistake.
8aa67986-39c9-488a-b2e4-3d4a0716b7ca|Seven, if you can hear me, respond.
6678ed63-3334-4a29-b008-0316ad5daffc|What do we do, respond?
96e2050d-aa8d-45a2-8674-89ada84bda76|I didn't respond; I was surprised.
d0f0648a-a18c-41cc-a85c-8a00c23c2c1b|Police are responding, taking this very seriously.
72a2d830-6b05-4a5f-ac00-e48077b667ba|Your body isn't responding as we'd hoped.
58059d29-ada3-48a3-b061-a25e4e0c10a9|I can see why this might be popular.
e16f881a-4406-4038-90ff-a18cab3d5102|Oh, I've been a very popular man today.
7ec2489e-b010-48be-825d-cc5e5f3e4608|You're one of my most popular girls.
e6ce8984-80d8-42be-9094-417946d8fb35|I wasn't the most popular kid.
92b606c5-4af9-4a3d-8c4d-428e70478681|And the popular kids won't be invited.
1f6d687d-5ca1-48c0-ba6e-3953359e756c|Could you do it harder?
a3ff796e-7ef4-416b-9972-9ffd0660a020|Shouldn't you be trying harder to look innocent?
283f3375-ee4f-4375-8c82-7b8e5028fcb3|You said I should have worked harder at school.
3f797742-ea6a-4600-ab9e-68d4aa12a8e6|Oh, she said do it harder.
c8f3e0fd-c473-4326-b82a-4f88e548a1e2|It's hard to get out of, right?
c39c351f-3edc-4dd7-b8af-7c6a8cc1a469|You're in a very bad physical condition.
2dd78fa4-ec18-4185-ae2a-143781bf98bf|Is it a physical thing, son?
83ca8783-81a2-4afa-8f09-16758516f30b|And there's gonna be a lot of talk.
f9c90c86-77bb-479d-8bac-3dd30a4b1e46|Could you go and talk to his wife?
50a315b4-d27d-41c4-a52f-b01bfa49dcea|Well, I'd best go talk to them right away.
08a2e725-3ace-4e59-bfd0-da3f8abd4dd6|I'll just have my mom talk to her.
8fb66f39-5018-4401-a5c2-ebaa16a9b740|Well, how did your talk with Ashley go?
d29b29fd-6424-456b-9f26-8176e4601123|Do those soldiers know they contain bombs?
05fd8fbf-7489-4c43-8307-3895de525015|We should've had this contained days ago.
bd8dfd0f-aa14-419c-bafe-6dbfb0b89af3|Just tell me that Maggie is contained.
bb85e95b-e64b-4eda-a29b-c66f068c2b4f|They'll come and contain him.
726c777f-e82f-4882-b245-3d53b4f1fa27|Which means we can contain it.
386490b4-77df-48b2-abe7-ab8315b71abe|Some say they want only to live in peace.
38a940ff-40e8-49ff-aeda-ec42aa9cb063|I'm just gonna check, just for peace of mind.
ffb50e7c-0e0d-49ac-a878-568f107b21e0|It is not possible to have peace here!
b4cf3f89-0843-49a3-a1f0-50613fdd8177|I knew I could die in peace.
13bce74b-1d64-4216-a870-4ee847d3cd18|What price can you put on peace of mind?
d14bb54f-fa4f-41f0-8084-75374a7beb91|But you definitely are not a green man.
4135f745-aaa1-4d73-a39d-9b1de2178911|You need some of the green stuff.
77224316-c9a8-4dbb-af00-e3adb7fc9650|All positions green light, take him down.
ca1a8a65-c084-4a16-a55c-d7a4f34c43b4|We were all so green.
f30cf1a0-4b5a-463e-a75d-5fde9971fabf|No, thanks, it's already much better.
8c892eaa-3dcd-4e5c-99d3-f02965272cfa|Oh, thanks, but he's not my dad.
dad66266-f946-4b05-a6c6-942d7377a735|Just wanted to say thanks for everything, man.
bc4d9da9-ad47-469e-8def-c6c7c0791444|Sarah, thanks for coming down again.
5c5759e3-0b8c-495c-91fb-1322ba70ff03|And I can start to control other people's bodies.
e6ea3199-ff32-446c-80bd-0fa23a27a0b9|I believe life support is controlled from over there.
21a71bf2-0528-4bfc-9207-0e996295802d|He never would have sent something to control me.
40a33126-15fa-4f26-b505-540133ccc09b|Don't let it control your mind.
424966e7-a8ac-4224-80be-e0199e42cd72|Well democrats, come to your senses, you animals!
490c5c28-365a-4416-b4d4-d50ed1a78bb3|They're all Democrats, so it can't be politics.
47fa7928-f3a2-4938-bf81-228c656c4684|There is enormous pressure from local black Democrats.
e75200b0-9b05-4862-bf2d-1aa660cea71f|You'll have to take that up with home base.
67a25447-37a8-43cc-8bbf-3a31d32d2dc9|Same as if we were on base.
758640a4-2265-464b-ae2c-99f7236a3e29|I wish we were near a military base.
517d0d80-da3b-4627-ba5b-72ca2c9c2c44|The way he played second base was a crime.
17220da3-d2f7-4db3-a44c-9212874f7432|We could get kicked off base for this?
a5caabfc-815a-4c6b-94de-0496206a2fdf|You can't prepare for a sudden impact.
cf7c166e-bc3c-4a7a-8589-07ec3c0c9311|If you need me, use this string impact.
69bd433f-e566-448e-8a94-e1df4b3a6ccd|These boys, they need structure.
c8f6d297-2d51-4826-abf4-edf03af97624|The church is merely a structure built by man.
f54e53ea-9c2c-469f-a3f2-992a59d91302|There was no structure to his crew.
965fa66f-6b98-49b9-ba2e-fce36b70ae72|What else can you tell us about the structure?
5e1f2f0a-a57f-4ed9-b057-5bd981d9f71c|What did you think was going to happen tonight?
e3d8377d-880c-4f4f-8788-0adbe78eb93c|I will probably find out tonight.
4dbffe25-86a7-4cba-aa48-db7df00758ab|He's lying about not being able to sleep tonight.
7de9e0ff-f815-4b66-9235-dc3f2a85a3f5|That was a really nice thing you did tonight.
1a2c6c8a-f67f-42f5-80cf-e860e66e2fd6|Can't he stay with me, just tonight?
405e67f6-7e9e-4a27-ab30-0d98524c342a|I am gonna make you happy tonight.
d14ec4e9-6973-416c-a88f-2e4f55dc7bc2|You came out with me tonight.
96d76433-76d9-4237-b3e1-e756dba2b70c|He's with his father tonight.
3a74e818-3c87-48a3-adbe-a8196f8ff40e|Don't you feel good, about tonight?
bc89e7cb-34ee-4e2c-a80e-fcb531881ca4|One light, come on, here we go, big notes.
59297deb-b40a-4db4-8d88-2367c8f863cb|No, I have a note from a doctor.
06a76829-9d7f-4011-bdc8-ac4a94736963|You've got a perfect sense of direction.
29a34b03-0693-45c7-9522-3cd0d40b2e6e|Point it in my direction.
bfa2040d-9a99-4a8d-8298-975563e87bbf|How can he fly, you see he's a kid?
b457e2fa-22c5-4506-9c46-efa94d052fb2|Six seconds to fly or die.
25836782-3abd-4ad0-ab6d-e37023c3c9fb|See how far I can fly.
60d3bd26-f305-423f-a6bd-97c012654f71|You think she's onto us?
cbd9663a-217d-4105-9740-ca243d0ea1d0|Okay, I'm gonna move you onto your side.
cc2e00c6-7082-4eb3-8c58-362064f65ae6|Can I hang onto this?
de5ef62d-4ee4-47fe-a0d4-a48d95a6361e|And who'd hang onto mine?
e36ae8ae-bf52-4816-974a-d4479bb76328|Well, I wouldn't say king of the world.
453341c9-1eb9-4b15-b722-b1f136e1923f|You will never be king.
9ed92361-d9df-47c1-889a-ba03faff4991|Now, my brother I shall be king.
f5c0d7cc-88ed-41ae-aede-e7589af7d712|The people might make him king.
41a9f029-408a-4c38-b39f-40b6a228d78b|They can reveal things about someone's health.
24302f80-c178-4f3c-98b4-5f83f754aef1|He'll only reveal what he wants us to see.
359b39af-9a06-466c-81df-368b1cdcc0f3|What if it reveals she dies young?
821f4f4e-2576-4234-9ccb-eff7b6b46dce|Why doesn't your cell shut?
f812cfdb-c9fd-48c4-ab0c-0f6e8376d849|How did you get my cell phone number?
54cda5d7-327b-4f9f-bc3d-ac99c7158445|How did you know he was in the cells?
b25b887b-e129-49ee-8a55-242eb2eb68c3|Well, like I said, we found her cell phone.
ca399df6-ec10-4c96-b1e8-a78205daf628|Otherwise it's a ball of religious person.
5097f0f5-7068-441a-906d-73f4aa9ed855|There were rules in the religious life.
ee8a98d3-8286-4046-8360-b622bb8fbba3|They can't even pick that ball up.
cf17b36f-7bd2-40f4-a0ad-60053f71f6b9|We play ball with him on Wednesday nights.
9476b5a0-2cdb-4c2a-8e33-b3c8f1f76bf4|Yeah, because you gotta feel the ball.
25b75463-6383-4332-9483-0cf18c1aad0b|You can be a good employee, a wonderful parent.
ff1c18c8-05b0-44e6-9be7-93f6ee6c295b|I know how my employees think.
314cfb72-b962-482d-b4a3-d44f7b3e009a|He's no longer an employee at this store.
71039f90-48c7-47ca-9f21-0f861186170f|You should know what you're heading into.
e8624ad6-151d-4588-bf27-01ff2303dd5f|About to head home and have crazy sex.
8118282d-16d3-41c0-8bbb-0dba9a7a0371|Then you're headed the right way.
c77c0d57-b2d1-4252-b286-232212d55707|I know exactly where she is heading.
de369470-de23-44f6-86d7-71c4240155fd|He was headed for the hospital.
dfc38bf4-220f-467d-be51-2bfec74ec84c|But suddenly, it was feeling like the wrong move.
b3025e16-9711-415d-9836-c1be50024257|Then it all comes back suddenly, like.
9020e47e-3bc5-466e-ac1b-4dc62c40578a|Oh, it's a lot less fresh suddenly.
2d9e64b3-27a6-456b-9b1a-f7750ac6739f|Why are you suddenly against me?
6c3a6f65-84c4-4ad4-a5b5-04a378a7147b|I just know that suddenly I really miss Amanda.
cb20b476-492d-49ae-8333-b6669447c0ca|If same terms still apply.
b471778a-fb90-4fe6-9a2f-1b29a20040f4|He should be applying to colleges.
188237bd-b65c-4200-b8a4-de7086a1fcce|I didn't apply for a job with you.
13f9d6af-2f18-4ca9-96ef-6c3033207f65|I know everyone's a bit shaken up.
6aef84c5-e95a-4e95-a979-eeb96321239a|I would shake your hand.
86524dfa-34b8-4deb-8e1b-115c71784f08|You seem a little shaken up yourself.
ee416fa5-5f34-49c7-87b1-70d4be953836|I shook them in the car earlier!
aed09edc-6605-424a-9ddd-0bb6a575882f|The students call the protests in Paris cultural revolution.
7192824d-ca3b-4562-933a-bc51fd8a3bba|In a way, street animals are our cultural symbol.
2810a745-d7e7-485d-bcde-9926d27ec134|You even sat in my chair.
cc38aadb-8187-4000-b692-f9008b72b667|Well, you can't even get a chair.
faccad18-9c72-4b49-9357-8b2c470202f2|No, you're not ready for a chair.
a49f5c62-ea2e-450c-a348-23ae9ba1621f|But we got a blood pressure chair.
c4f9c2aa-a53c-4157-b14a-8bc8db61a61f|You have your picture of justice.
adfc8813-8020-46fd-83ab-2f2adbf1d3ff|Let justice be done upon him!
9eaf0487-2d6d-4db7-8a67-3d49bd77f2bb|There is no law, there is no justice.
b6be9a05-5953-4d68-a352-62044edfdfde|But then I wanted to do it justice.
d74a4b90-4ae2-4d99-809f-bad22e21a463|I wanted to explore space and discover new worlds.
6fbcb05f-e59f-4d71-b0da-6e8b7d03e55e|I have discovered check covered.
8ab137dc-2215-448f-9926-1c3463f7db89|It's no measure of your strength.
7c64d5f1-5f48-4eeb-8a07-a26080835cc4|This is the new measure of time.
eb42c971-dfc0-4113-9091-971634098235|After Sarah ran away, he should have taken measures.
5de6820d-b543-40be-915d-6f74006bc604|But you use religion to play politics.
aa4b5a9c-f69c-4df5-a0f7-f3b03138176c|No one knows what will happen in politics.
1302a158-0a09-44b6-84b4-1c6b8f823b15|The good thing about politics is close doesn't count.
cc77dc91-d29e-4b09-8e23-f0268dc4ea20|Is your wife involved in politics?
d0a91aa7-68dd-4999-9bd0-6786bbe700e9|We haven't managed to reach Catherine's father yet.
0ba56978-bc34-4dfd-914a-59b17640bede|He managed the place where they found her.
4c65bd33-19a0-484c-b838-40ad4962c39a|I think we've managed to lose them.
426263ff-94e9-43fa-bf16-3cd1bf565ad8|We've managed so far, haven't we?
31922ad6-187b-454e-b6b7-5443e0ee54ae|Just wondering how you ever manage to pull.
9fd1b3f9-d30a-4832-84ef-48e92653ad0f|It's no way to treat a girl like you.
0ff9ffbe-c708-4dc5-ba7e-91546c058b45|You always treat me like a kid.
a2dc356f-0f09-4f1d-b30c-5c6b72065fbf|I am sick of being treated like a child.
a352eaff-4d19-44a1-b511-d8d41d57d8b2|And I don't know how to treat him.
e9109c09-b22f-4cb2-8d49-de680cd324dd|I've treated you like a daughter.
8c0a7f17-bf8a-4853-a7cb-8e124489b490|So, you got yourself a full house now.
9f766fc6-0b0f-4cac-8686-6590117b6cda|Why don't you get yourself ready?
63c3ba87-799e-48e2-9a4a-4430598a38ed|If makes you feel better about yourself.
619eeaf8-389f-4453-8d87-c37ecbcb8d93|What are you calling yourself these days?
25e7fa46-74ee-4b91-a139-4557f1856909|And there will be much more pain.
1f773991-11cc-4d31-973d-22887c39d213|That's the thing about pain, isn't it?
cbde907b-844b-4c30-88df-3baf1eda863a|Do you want me to be in pain?
172b871c-5462-4feb-8739-f4683ffba3d6|No, I'm expecting a visit this evening.
9d600986-22d7-44a4-847c-870499f836ad|Oh, I have quite the evening planned.
6f35b354-651c-4cf2-821d-798b488c02b7|Tell me, what kind of evening is it?
a6f94e58-d141-41c3-b888-05ca187c8e93|Maybe some other evening, Mr Oscar.
2792232e-a8f5-4ae6-b755-e0ce00dd4c58|Sometimes evening the score, that's all it takes.
5b2be8c4-dac9-4ad6-8fe0-9de670567f70|I'm just evening it out, up here.
6981ecc9-a93a-460b-aef8-29bf2c6dee42|You know, things have a way of evening out.
dd65bc1f-454a-407f-90c9-77be75a823d1|I have not seen you last, Evening?
372a314e-9854-4a29-ad0a-d68239ff550e|Maybe I should move to another unit.
881db295-5793-4c74-8ceb-00e7a01885d0|All units, hold your fire!
0990e5f7-f431-4c17-aa35-c39f1c388e97|You know, I think you're a very special unit.
a6783295-5906-4732-926c-f9d036edc82d|Well, you should, this unit needs you.
4c725f44-267c-4ac4-81f3-06c4116e9f40|What unit did you say you were in?
49777191-2769-49d3-bae6-efba14461209|I imagine you're wondering how does this affect you.
c05e811e-be1f-46e4-81b9-5ce7506daf4e|What if it affected my ability to testify?
d57777ee-3d03-4afa-b55b-f331ea8ac15e|And this affects me how, exactly?
e3b8719e-2d2b-42bb-b81a-dfc7aeaac042|How you getting on with playing and standing up?
09b3f081-d76e-488f-8d2c-ebb22f10ac31|I don't love only playing.
c141e67e-161b-4c3b-b100-327fe4de8a2e|I've had enough playing doctor.
28745e56-30bd-4341-9d98-8cbdffe505b3|Everybody's playing, I'm the only one working here.
b80bbbd0-12d0-411e-a9bf-ef9236851354|I want to take you where the music's playing.
690f0c22-63c8-4bbf-bf2c-33822736187d|Come on, Taylor, production values matter.
29375920-5830-43e7-a20f-a1e17140cbe2|Check out that production equipment, all right?
3605b6ad-ee61-4005-914e-e4e0b35e0a6d|I helped secure the funding for that production.
f738854e-95ff-451d-88c0-d48237af57e2|Production assistants are usually younger than you.
481f3db6-dab4-427f-b22d-a83bc7e496af|A call just came in to the production phone.
81903645-15b4-4bea-b1bd-5a6f6b802287|And maybe a bit hard to love.
45b4f053-a6e7-4908-9b6a-1f44938191d2|I'm gonna look around a bit.
a1a778fe-24b8-4c56-b8a0-cc50523aeef9|I'm going to need a bit of time.
3cca457c-8787-4107-8fe5-fbbc56af0948|Now, come on, a bit of history for you.
aa0fd5e5-cc8c-44dd-8e49-663ce4f9e1c0|I guess we'll find out in a little bit.
51add3b5-7536-409b-afe0-558df288712b|Hope I didn't leave anything inside her.
0dde7f0e-d09b-4edf-9474-837fae876b1f|That still doesn't get him inside the house.
9acc915a-e64f-4266-9bb8-9de6ba32d9e0|No, he was inside the whole time.
4590e67a-eccd-4c81-a6d8-e88f22aba5a5|You clearly know the inside story.
4720ddb6-ca90-4a4e-8158-9fd4305c1269|Maybe she's his inside connection.
1d373ba1-c4c0-4e47-8b99-14d983e90352|She says you have to be, this far north.
2d0fd057-db95-40bc-ac29-eb4a4e6c6295|As farthest as possible, I can assure you.
ef4c12e5-4805-4740-ab1c-2eadac5f1f2a|It's very beautiful, but out of our price range.
882abc95-1df5-4e19-88cd-3d6db1712c87|She shot us both at close range.
f3853c92-8420-4a25-bfb8-58b4ad82bff9|But I'm probably pretty good from this range.
88ace11e-f4a7-4630-abb5-7694add4b6cc|I don't know how you're gonna top that.
d8cf90cd-b60b-4f77-bff5-8dae41a07e17|Thank you all for picking your top three choices.
4f1641e3-fa5a-4c1c-9e0e-8ad5e168aea8|These were on top apparently.
57312f7f-d20e-48cd-905b-4134ddec19c2|Was I not one of your top students?
378e02bc-7035-4224-bb18-c5277fbb3511|Don't worry, they won't let us.
6ec15e92-2b4a-4a4b-b142-d321d320b09c|But don't worry, I have a plan.
35caed23-9a57-4fe3-b366-0c1104d43f56|I wasn't worrying about me.
1c9a94dc-46b2-4bff-ac12-3dbcdd4b8dd4|I'm not, so I have nothing to worry about.
d7a52010-e223-4962-8683-75b9ecd8d813|Performing at that bar didn't pay much.
43c05a54-4256-4b31-93f2-89ac286a32eb|No, no, although he's had to perform a lot.
8f9e30e6-1b8c-4510-8d66-1f214b8ee740|How many surgeries have you performed?
f6618f43-afbe-4098-a482-2020054a395b|He won't be performing now.
59900613-aa0c-4904-a20f-ad7da8419a69|You perform, you drink, you sleep, perform, drink.
f6f16d5f-0f32-4add-b64c-c4753a6e9c81|Do you think all this is really necessary?
a556f7cb-be3b-4176-b6ce-c8c84f6b5f93|I'll drop them if necessary.
64507131-2516-465b-bee6-7c6ed5a84cd1|I can wait as long as necessary.
21f8ec63-debf-447a-838b-e9c864681c94|I even called a press conference.
5f47bda2-2640-4b1a-9970-2c1872f3cf8a|Chandler just said he's got a conference there.
7206c8a7-7c7a-4ca7-8031-e0d571f24585|I have the most interesting job at the conference.
6bf0d376-bf85-4770-9daf-69953e6282fb|He's what we call a candidate.
3877276b-0346-44bf-87db-9b76c158fbe5|And I don't have a candidate for the election.
c402dbc6-9916-43d7-b370-600455bf4e42|Maurice, this is not a museum of the dead.
063f6b06-18eb-4696-84da-01db463fc0c1|And we built an entire museum around it.
8786eac4-8e40-4297-86ad-444f6ea8a0f1|You've been to a museum before, right?
62e6ba6e-1ee4-43c7-bb7d-a5b207281fff|I didn't get to go to the museum.
40a6c4fd-25b7-4219-a0ed-bbe3680c1b6d|We want specific networks dropped from our cable.
347a9246-7bf5-4c35-bb90-dade91e21de0|Could you be a little bit more specific?
b1064182-fe41-4d2c-84d8-4dd4aaa7fef9|But you're a very specific type.
6d52d71f-cb44-4faa-af50-48d8443ec598|Can you maybe be a little bit more specific?
be6ccae2-78e7-4b7b-982e-fbb794ffdbb5|I defended myself best I could.
f742576a-8bac-4502-a710-68ca7d1b4ea3|They're the best because they go nowhere.
7510f0b6-a9c0-4f09-9892-dd2b8a4c374e|I will serve you as best I can.
5879cc98-44c7-472e-92c3-4ccdfe57b61b|That thing works best if it's completely empty.
5375c926-c152-46db-aca7-ac27ab1e5b0c|Yes, it's beginning to spread generally throughout the ship.
c6af0f7e-6375-4b71-8cf5-97f2aa4d361b|Are these cameras all throughout the house?
2acb1dff-9d39-4669-8254-552e5b0b7a57|We can see to get out into the hall.
01151319-8bc9-494b-a818-bf6b5f70ba6c|You'll be right down the hall!
8986c2e7-948e-4260-848c-ed038379df58|You know, your past is not helping you.
b9ea4d2c-d8d7-4198-95ca-f0dc6ca310a2|I thought that was your past.
0c5820bd-daaf-4c19-829b-6b4cc6ade4b2|Any signs of trouble from his past?
32f0c3b3-b307-4b72-ab83-2cf4d8d3d970|Doing this really makes me think about the past.
479b521c-18e0-41eb-bdda-4e80274b3fcb|I always loved fishing as a kid.
6c847453-5344-4887-ae8e-5b5c7b768312|What's she doing with another fish anyway?
d2740716-2030-437d-aa8a-caf058988dc5|They move faster than normal fish do.
66253017-6cfd-4c1c-8a1b-0aa6722245bc|They throw the fish back, you know.
bc41330b-1dde-4eba-b77b-f7ac7e138b70|Yeah, well, you can stop fishing here.
7c900cfb-fca7-47a7-8208-6cf51e5d9cae|I haven't seen you this whole trip.
8a2b0f70-7f89-496e-9896-6634619b49a8|He's on a field trip, isn't he?
947fd169-90de-419c-8286-04877da18289|Did you tell the police about your trip?
53b111bb-22c0-4faf-aff7-68b8f593aaf7|How about going on a trip?
34fb5c65-f3df-41a6-93b2-9fe34c3d7b8b|You up for a road trip?
2c6d162d-3f9b-4bf4-a917-bc3ce802076f|I'd like you to mention it in your report.
a40f815b-2732-49df-8d76-57e2244a5523|Yeah, you did mention that already.
7bfb4081-54ff-4e86-9e7d-5f6555dc3743|I want that mentioned in your report.
cbb56b91-8dce-4924-9356-dd55cc027de2|I think you gotta get back from that edge.
aa826b89-0ed8-4149-b740-40f4c5b1db1d|Oh, oh, it's no trouble at all.
21c5f1ea-840a-4e99-9ac4-fdf7aaaebc39|I don't want trouble with you.
20cc942c-5234-4e64-8c48-a8bc70bdf676|Don't worry, you're not in trouble.
94abbf57-eaaf-40f8-9273-9d934326e916|Trouble is what our people live for.
3d0c0381-cd40-4caf-98d2-c4182a45a60e|You get it when you pass the interview.
746b92ae-79a2-41b2-b0f3-80e1f55796df|We'll see what we get from the family interviews.
f83ada63-02ef-49f2-aba7-fcf4dde72dcd|She told me before we started the interview.
4048f3a9-672e-4b60-83a7-d2ea13c38079|The rest will go out of style.
08bd54fb-1909-40ae-a3bd-b6b18b00aaee|And it looks true to your style too.
3c4d21bb-5eeb-43e8-b896-ac0d0abc77b3|We have very different styles.
baadd02a-d8bd-4936-9fac-996f65a5e20a|You've got this great style.
8665d03c-815c-4fa5-a544-7062cc166f44|Yeah, middle school starts in two days.
f8f85d36-a606-4ca9-a932-694a642cfbc8|Her middle name and this street name.
dc481b9c-15fd-4392-ae65-b09fd44bf70e|Ask where he went to middle school.
e7a2132d-fc04-4518-9f03-2c0e93371db3|What was that middle one?
8c602ba4-1585-4257-8a98-452955641aa6|'Cause she's gonna do it to him.
7923baf0-6fc6-40e5-93b1-e18c99e6a8ec|'Cause next, it'll be three cases, then four.
e1becfd8-ad1f-4ac7-8c69-683404bb810a|Is 'cause I heard from an old college friend.
0e7d3f94-0952-43ba-8ea2-06148b5b6c2b|This is exactly what happened ten years ago.
a1c9dd83-1f49-4bbb-92eb-600b5b6eaf7b|She died ten years ago.
6950021f-ce43-4acb-8861-d6d333c65b90|What has it been, ten years?
97358cfb-3c95-4850-bc0f-0331f9d0569b|Look at me, ten years in their service.
6c577cbf-3319-4f69-baa2-6eba95dada3b|It's been like that for, like, ten minutes.
585c3c64-caa7-4939-b4f7-d634df597611|Exactly, you need to start pulling your weight.
acbf4653-c282-4beb-a2f6-aa7cbebc4a69|I've never failed to make the weight.
52e0f613-b66e-43a8-928a-4fb829a59fce|I can put a little weight on it.
82ac982f-7635-4f00-a7a3-9b46fc209238|I want to act like an adult.
ed90c5f1-1247-4233-8a59-f93668f3f857|You've become adults, that must be it.
73a4b0b1-a442-4c72-8871-0730dfc55b16|I've never seen one before in an adult.
f2f30a7b-c122-4be2-8fb8-456805c68dd7|I often have the same dream.
154cbad5-bc64-4977-8c38-73518e734b66|His dream will come true.
956d014e-39e1-4905-95f6-55a48b0ddbfe|I don't have any fear anymore.
46e83d93-8865-46bf-8644-dbc7bd14858d|Don't give into your fear.
53c36bfc-817c-487a-8b13-0b6684baf040|This is my worst fear realized.
6e731d43-caa3-4d21-a6ed-c784ac3a62ee|Some for love, some for fear.
38949593-feb5-45b0-ba00-6a77fca41bfd|Don't want you leading me to the dark side.
d7c4b526-7b7a-4352-ab51-4ae6dd56e711|No, it's dark in there!
be2b7cf1-70d4-45fa-b552-92faef3f384c|It's gonna be too dark.
a792ca3d-de1f-4086-b329-b619653862d3|Well, I'm not signing away my rights.
05c797a1-2c0c-4b32-8e4f-6981a2fc32db|He signed out a car two weeks before that.
bb202511-a0b1-4c8d-baa3-5fc76deab257|I've got some papers I need you to sign.
9340927e-8c80-4525-a73e-0c18f61b06f6|Should have brought my book for you to sign.
2428f3e4-3a29-441b-9102-bc7ed031893e|Just use whatever method to just get through it.
0c2a1c5b-56f1-4d89-8475-7e758bb743b7|Is there something wrong with my methods?
3109a700-f083-4067-a4ca-04b00cff8982|Well, have you tried the warm water method?
ee8a7e90-83f0-44bf-8632-3c1ad7378577|Here by yourself or waiting for somebody?
cb041a23-f32f-4f5a-8b0f-d7addcdb99a4|He's somebody she made up.
a5da098c-0049-4b0f-8a5e-386a0ef3031f|I know somebody put you up to it.
8cf77013-c9e9-4cc0-882f-74f280160ed8|They want me to see somebody.
e8be15e2-3b44-4d0d-818e-5b4f5e0cc67c|Maybe he had somebody pick him up.
501c7c2c-26cd-4b46-8ee3-62d419992918|Somebody broke in looking for something, probably a file.
2228c171-9b11-43dd-9c5d-151b159f8284|Somebody shot someone in the head with that weapon.
abc19953-116b-41bd-91a6-df3320ab0421|Did somebody hurt you, daughter?
086c7c2c-ff19-49f2-ad2d-c19be579758e|Would you like to see any magazines today?
a114938c-4bb5-4220-9e26-34211bc40d56|Right after sex, she read a magazine.
8f37fe7f-f022-45a1-b27e-3725562b45e0|I read this in a magazine somewhere.
84c1fe49-23c2-4d65-b5b5-d4f9f55ee290|I'll tell you if you return the magazine.
20b098bf-3451-42cf-9215-3ac028264032|A man's home should reflect who he is.
231afbe9-84e2-4b64-9ec0-59890d16bf6c|But it can not reflect the correct images.
2eba45ee-58d0-4ad7-982b-a7f93defb5ad|It's not reflected in his medical records.
af32092a-5c79-4896-91c4-93a42db10d38|Our children's future reflecting back in each other's eyes.
d57d47a1-4735-4f97-a3d3-3b0e49691ab7|Everybody tried to be that heavy after that.
a4399cf8-ab36-4252-b3bf-e0929cf63787|It's a little heavy for summer though, I think.
dfb03997-d59c-45a9-bda0-7fca4263fece|That is much too heavy.
667c2283-b6f0-46d4-a95d-17f4635be4ba|I write to you today with heavy heart.
0d46b433-f80d-4e6b-8bf4-72463345b5bf|The soldiers, what are they doing?
4cd7902f-7fb7-4c32-9712-76e51b5e6639|But the soldiers outside, they were following my orders.
625d55f3-134d-4dd7-8824-7d1c0ab0d7ed|Our soldiers died so that Germany may live.
d5c4ca21-52f3-4b6b-bb2e-fa2056e167fa|And, as soldiers, it is our business.
fd44d8e8-09d9-464a-a980-13775a1295f4|A dead body ain't property by law.
802ae680-2125-47dc-876d-1686fccfc154|He told you to stay off our property.
0aac3dde-a54d-4888-af34-b2a1eed3637a|Now get the hell off my property.
e998e0e9-4304-4d72-9510-af6bc19a3372|This isn't a property program, is it?
e3214ba1-f9d4-4546-ae0f-b2c885f96e15|Property was shared out between us.
f240ede1-66df-4025-ae4f-0be23ff0458a|I was with the most beautiful woman last night.
a5dd8d1d-0436-4bb4-8b1d-c32b31656b1a|They're living on this beautiful island.
835411e8-fa91-4193-9f00-54c51f03d99f|Well, could you leave your beautiful body here?
c2d1f97f-f9ca-4221-bf57-ea55927e34fd|Because we know life is beautiful.
79e7c206-e5f7-448b-909d-bab36e9166a2|You have such beautiful lights out in the window.
8d453a9a-c1a0-4581-9b08-c976bfb2e7d9|I want you to talk to the writer.
2a59b609-9d99-4fd5-b587-d6dc321d1126|I'll tell you, you look like a writer.
260411c4-0640-4a97-b30c-834667c26748|Which is why you're going to become a writer.
1d01d9db-5be5-4f3e-b520-9ebdf5eec30d|I thought you writers liked being alone.
bd8adb79-ea91-486f-8b5a-5136d12bd960|Let's go open up the good stuff.
23f7e971-109e-42a7-8288-d47049137733|How did the job stuff go?
3acf3d0c-fc5c-4c5f-81d6-f4975635d296|What kind of stuff does she like?
8489dc7d-f902-44cb-a90b-0f42a8fad633|You were always better at this stuff.
067b1d17-ddff-4126-aa71-e9c15eea5717|I forgot how strong this stuff is.
5f8fa60d-d7ed-4826-834a-62aab56b9989|You even carry along a camera.
015f0ba5-b137-4b05-bc0a-d414fdf0e09f|Cameras are there, there, there and there.
cf21d02d-991d-41d4-b893-59886dc76ce2|We got camera three going up.
7f140c95-44a6-4b69-91e6-d5b644dc14a5|You're not going in front of the camera.
6a50b6f9-fe3b-49c0-815d-058bd5f8c0a0|Has his condition improved at all?
d31abf15-a3e4-4197-b45b-d70b13f5c417|If so, the world won't improve.
e53b0027-48dd-40dc-97b8-7a990c979464|Really, I think your skills are improving.
b9f39f3a-c921-4dd4-b54b-a38f7377e097|And this way, they get to improve their English.
fd07c617-353a-427e-a480-8ba102bb7c52|I put that chip on your shoulder, boy.
bf6d25bb-1108-4159-a247-c23dddf9e8c7|I saw what you did to his shoulder.
7617ef95-a843-4b51-b63e-dee90a5eb22f|It's just a shoulder wound, straight through and through.
2dfba079-9a17-49b7-888f-b21317494735|Well, you have a lot on your shoulders.
9f4c6132-cb1b-477c-abdb-adc9bc2a2a7f|All right, let's start that bar fight.
bcf36100-0136-47fe-b3b7-63579c06f0d1|I saw you at the bar.
9f6c73f5-f7cb-49ad-bc6c-0f727af5e1e1|I'm sorry I bought a bar without telling you.
851d23ad-4da8-411b-b22d-1d08d179f1fb|I would have preferred the bar.
09b0e5b2-8eae-4287-b317-6502517385ad|I left them back at the hotel.
78b5cc8a-569d-48ca-9dc9-1b1091ca50b0|Is it the same hotel as last year?
4a20b070-2513-4f00-b1b5-5b5f17f138c6|Just go back to your hotel.
07d4568d-c457-4751-bf3a-e6e6cb8dbb80|Oh, so we can kill that person instead.
82d2ce2e-5bda-4310-ac73-7131be34dbe7|But maybe you can do that instead.
de8434c0-6d0c-4737-9a87-749ef99f8cb5|You know what I should've done instead?
1a89b2db-80f6-451a-9e83-eaddae7bc4bc|Isn't there anyone else you'd like to ask instead?
c1bca5c2-e691-4345-8896-89202b88bbc4|When does a hill become a mountain?
92d5911b-b8ea-4f1a-a0c7-980442507d79|I'm not going over that hill again.
b5b90878-3517-4dbd-ad76-fa9dcb0e0f8a|Which hills, and how far?
aa7d35c1-86af-4ec6-9b58-baa9ac247cb2|They exist, so where are they?
f1c7292f-3f49-47bb-82bd-90a0569f6164|For you, I do not yet exist.
e3d2e241-94d6-4d06-b270-6e763b9e1f6e|Nothing else existed until I saw you.
0d99f225-929e-4f56-babb-d2123eebcb94|Well, sir, everything gets worn down in the sea.
fd05720d-479a-4f98-b88e-d242e485af06|Two, they come by sea.
b8c5e76d-8246-4fd2-a99a-bc657569516c|The sea will take care of it.
bc65cfc9-b636-4706-97d2-e3288773a7e3|You remember when your dad was away at sea?
f994e63f-b868-462d-aad8-4516c23e3ad7|No, mom, I didn't do it on purpose.
33cb18a7-c18b-407d-a4b1-f9efb965692f|You are clear to your purpose?
678c7e1d-777d-4c03-b0ac-47056104cdf9|But he was sent here for that purpose.
6c3398c7-5f24-477b-9097-95356979a0ff|You burned it down on purpose?
1dabf069-c32d-4fd4-a193-c34ea2cbb287|That party's old pattern of cutting and running.
61407915-7da7-467f-b2c3-d7f36c2febd1|Let me explain in more detail.
892b749c-570f-4475-9b18-a2cb7027e29a|I'll have my office reach out with the details.
400174ed-c88b-4b36-b1d4-879a9c509d93|If you have a detail we could use.
14e421a2-53c4-4da5-b2f2-3965baa1eabb|Man, you don't miss a detail.
9729a600-c860-49c3-9a46-42f3adeb755c|Do you have some change for the machine?
b791b7c9-da3d-4270-85a0-280b8e62ddfa|I'm sure machines did that.
da6114c4-f2e1-4ac4-b1d0-5373d59f3b05|Can you believe this stupid machine?
b78f9f74-7de1-43dc-91f3-040e7a5d22ac|It is quite well, send machine, wait.
632352fe-3d04-404e-bea3-f38ffc5dbb55|If you're still up for a challenge.
92c01faf-446f-4a38-9184-fc5453b31f45|Tables say a lot about their owners.
0a0199c4-b90b-4452-be6e-8c5d40bb92eb|I happen to be personal friends with the owner.
0a0d0f54-b39f-4505-a90c-04ef9657d783|I'm an owner in this hospital.
68aa1924-ba4f-499d-8e80-51786af28128|There was no proof that the owner drove it.
dc90c6db-fd5e-4ee5-ad62-0aa2ee334dfa|The owners aren't around right now.
07abb0f9-cb24-458c-a3f1-4ba409656aed|By threatening the life of one of my agents?
86e4bb09-45f3-4a88-807d-680417a0369a|You're gonna go with these agents.
45cad889-cceb-403e-a0f2-799ec46e1d75|Must've been tough on him, too, though.
a487d6f5-8777-45ee-b0ae-97f97284fc07|Because we're in a very tough situation.
1fabf049-2064-40b2-b4f0-7c30c5eda531|Because of a tough call he had to make.
68744d82-bec0-4d27-b062-bb281cfa3ec3|Even tough guys have got to eat.
1054a241-5c04-4bd5-81a7-1bf0a8bc6029|He was going through a tough time.
98b7a266-338a-4ffd-bcfc-afa1fb8d1fe2|You go ahead, we'll wait here.
dacee850-6419-4569-bd6e-1646c85b7d39|All I need is your go ahead.
0f91feeb-1a6b-44a1-a877-46b37ec3e844|Go ahead and get in.
8e577c0e-3957-4ee5-bcab-552784e00ede|Why don't you go ahead and call the hospital?
e1b88790-d8e7-49e7-8001-fc1cca073b91|I don't think I can finish my commercial.
537e2594-78fd-40d3-b477-e20eecee4e93|Yet in his lifetime, he was a commercial disaster.
adac6ea3-2fe6-44f6-89dc-0f9daac87d08|I still cannot believe you people fly commercial.
d5b1fea6-8233-4a1e-a118-1375791c6724|On whom so much depends!
1274a33a-23ee-4da2-ae26-9de4f8cf6226|By whom were you struck?
a4f78643-4fe5-42e2-ae5e-8bd8b7209d2b|With whom did you fall in love?
fa544679-7e60-4efe-b33a-9405d66e7dfa|Yes, but you're in love with whom?
76804cde-dd3e-484b-9fc4-75ac60055f41|Did she ask you whom you were with?
f514d1eb-5634-4ce1-9ca5-0c8f8ef84c4e|I have one leaving in the fall.
d528e8ca-bab4-4231-9e67-9e7759ba16f0|Amy, I'm not gonna fall for that.
f0632bb7-2f14-48a1-a420-f469007065e1|Because I took the fall for him.
7393cb05-b170-47b4-b589-ea922de9a27c|You know, we sort of fall into these patterns.
cf3be20f-bb65-4079-8db1-38cdb542a820|I didn't go over the falls.
a9d16177-7968-4fd4-95f8-1ca93b2a34a3|We'll walk down these streets, take a look around.
24839264-16fd-48d0-abc0-11e284d19da2|Come on, down you go.
f53c2cbc-6046-4520-a2c5-a028bc0fc2cd|How do you know it leads to the surface?
a7d40043-fa55-4c1d-9823-18baf0eb6b77|No sign of human life on the surface, sir.
afab3c08-9005-4aec-b5f3-35abf84186f1|I say we try every surface we can find.
8732bb87-d4ee-4ee4-8ea9-45d31fb79336|I never should have gone to the surface.
aa13a9d7-b4dc-4115-abd8-2e7e3ce74f3d|She slipped, passed out and went under the surface.
22fb5956-4cf7-49bb-9a46-4b972a9bdaaf|This is exactly the budget of my dream wedding.
eff648be-1cee-449d-a859-2d63f4498046|Do you know how to read these budget reports?
5e0fa007-1bc2-4eb8-a06c-238ea9fa3b73|For some kind of budget review, something like that?
8a140f37-b512-4dfa-884d-73e575e7d478|Oh, afraid it's not in my budget.
31917e36-e82f-4df8-9577-0fe570bc7d5c|That's what budget cuts will get you.
819dcc30-4b8c-4a93-b7cc-29289873a88b|What made the senator decide to change his plans?
226f6556-2171-42dd-b1ef-55314ac6a808|Oh, senator Doyle, it's all part of the game.
8833e16a-e1e8-49ac-bd55-d006f2b78bda|I just had lunch with a senator.
283edb79-7ae5-4b14-adcf-91647dd6ed4e|I know it's your bag.
87bac89f-5432-45c1-a666-46045fe68738|Do you need another bag?
9ca4d06d-1835-4a57-a347-65ec13bd39aa|That was in your bag.
b969953e-2bcf-4948-af9a-e121ca41f2c8|That bag you're holding, it's mine.
999a93a0-8722-4b9a-9c82-bd03b636e11a|I guess there was nothing important in that bag?
1800fc78-8f0b-4c83-9172-34204de0f266|Sometimes, we have to accept our reality.
e59b64e1-c6e1-4895-8ea9-470f8f7dc8cc|The reality is the system doesn't always work.
49ce6052-127b-4e81-a5ea-3004afc16c27|For us editors, life is waiting.
e9fa3ae0-91f4-4fec-a846-fc1b2cc38515|In fact, you're supposed to call the chief editor.
81645634-d89a-458f-93ad-55ae48b0f31e|See, some people just don't think like an editor.
bae0ef72-396b-4eb3-a68b-66194c3ee6bd|They tend to, types like that.
8e16b74f-7308-426c-98f5-c8091151dbd1|Why won't his mother tend to him?
57ea026b-0410-4297-bd19-5c69238d3b97|Yeah, she tends to go all out.
660e72b4-5221-4bd1-8e69-3b368cd6a0b2|I have been tending my duties.
1bd01629-6604-463e-b5d7-85dd37aa95c5|Oh, it's addressed to my old flat in London!
9af4610d-b316-46fb-b33c-720baf73f36f|Which this program will address.
fc90d657-91d0-4ee2-a892-3622e450f34f|She will make you address my question.
24d8d163-d22a-4faf-8df8-ab5ac699f089|He didn't even want to address it.
2dd9d554-0701-4da4-a356-b869c0329a57|We can be civil, can't we, for the boys?
e6e1c929-978c-4770-8585-fa8990ceea52|Why don't you sit down and act civil?
e37bf4b1-5052-445d-9798-e6d402592ff1|I hear there's a terrible civil war going on.
0f143ca4-b7ee-4ec2-a165-a65215ef4053|Let's be civil to our guests.
5a2489e9-af86-4c05-8cac-d3f95fc70a50|You stepped up, Tom, when the country needed you.
109cb2b4-e652-4cc5-9876-3d5916d61117|I'll be stepping into those shoes.
491c1196-88ad-4c2a-b4aa-e5fdb0a2154d|Except this one day, he steps to me.
9ac41059-f57c-461e-a5fd-d194cc97d082|I've noticed a really interesting discussion point.
c719cb84-8b69-42a0-a9c2-dfb2d678289d|There's no time for discussion.
44edae8e-1e12-4d96-bb7f-b8ba5d835cdc|It's about time we had a family discussion.
c1dbde12-6af2-4099-83a6-ed488a24c395|There's only so much discussion a man can take!
fe85a469-1073-4221-8adc-9386457e063f|I also want to stop our discussion over prices.
0a55e9b8-bdb0-455b-98d6-6de470f63211|Don't they test for that stuff?
070ca7be-764c-4ec3-a460-59804e095691|I am not having my baby tested.
b8e508c8-359b-4b75-8d7d-27ee2fe8889f|If she tests me, I won't pass.
0da18e72-93c8-4972-aa84-f6c2eaf12fb3|Then why won't you be tested?
9f971f70-0e75-41c5-ade1-adf2e314274a|Yeah, but they weren't testing for the right thing.
2856d16e-7c49-48ae-ac68-b89673a15c8c|Mom and a guy named Carl?
76ac44bc-cae3-45cd-90fa-ec03aa467ade|Well, it's probably your mom calling you back.
9bcc110a-d78f-4646-ba30-9d7a87cb8d2d|My mom thinks I am.
2f919278-31d0-4bc9-8ce6-c569da14dbf3|Well, his mom's running for office.
efd31753-9404-47fa-bb1c-c383c8ee9b77|His dad just killed his mom.
c37c81e2-22ed-45e2-9c32-fe3ffea12ebd|There is no history of violence in the church.
8f641f1c-80f0-48f7-b6ee-e947189be006|He must be getting off on the violence.
f7aae882-37ec-4dd0-8f6f-5fe5e0d160a9|I take no pleasure in violence.
7c36d566-3330-4b61-9b9f-bd64632db547|You said you never saw any violence.
2370e9e8-53ae-460a-8ed7-dc4b01fd2d32|For a total bastard, he's pretty nice, isn't he?
416be057-08c0-4ce0-aee2-1e0cc20707fe|But it wasn't a total dead end though.
fe6ddf46-b5b8-4014-ab3b-4600c5ca4848|I mean, the main character is total white noise.
5fa66619-c1f6-4dc0-9b82-5deb9f8ed2ce|Not if you're serving it without the skin.
2ab985d3-c624-4628-b98e-1da9ef558d8d|He'll save his skin, Sir.
f21e69d6-f6dc-4ca1-9194-91f14057394e|Your skin makes me cry.
e716f20f-4649-447b-9d52-3f121cf6e080|You know, how does he get skin like that?
34f9bb08-3b0d-4c1a-b3b9-7a54dca12038|What about his skin color?
48579437-842e-4211-8fdc-edae2a654bcd|Maybe I should start packing heat again.
7aba6967-c28c-4d8f-b0c1-43762ec8d247|Not even you can avoid that kind of heat.
ad378618-eae6-401f-abe2-262c47e37f6c|That's just gonna heat him up.
cf533eec-66e2-48d4-aa57-b998268c2fb3|Why a council meeting about her?
98f1fd73-fc4e-4738-b7ec-fbb17604c605|And you are no longer on the council.
d4ee7c3d-c835-48a3-b2c6-b3d3f0e26183|I thought you got thrown off the council.
c9d3893d-6f41-4ac7-b055-81fc149b202f|You didn't tell them about the council.
0e904aca-f37d-451e-81c2-44d4a7b0935f|I think the council believes you now.
0430b63c-4ca1-4498-8c03-b950eda9f9bd|Your wife noticed it, so you knew.
5ab6b110-9788-4d16-b3dc-122bb4770bf6|Did you finally get her to notice you?
a9040391-2ad9-424b-bec5-7059a6b93cb7|He won't notice anything for now.
b8b062c4-1e0b-4a64-a6cb-5e62767d4336|It's just I never noticed it before.
3e1063eb-3e5d-4ec2-a552-9662f8eda584|He used to beat me up.
3a43a661-1d06-4a88-b6ca-4315b944d974|He said he was going to beat me.
bee0a234-5bb5-426f-9203-623393f59996|I've tried to beat it on my own.
79109b9e-8d00-431c-8583-2a94f78a826d|By any chance, did you beat me before?
af4958ac-fd4c-4fbc-8051-8b77103e2688|Come to think of it, nor do we.
8bed5e19-781e-4d18-9887-6173dca1d712|Nor could you ever think that.
487c1d44-88c5-4531-b3c4-f3d07a83623b|But you are neither Earl nor king.
89519193-7dd6-4bde-bbdd-5bf5783c85d3|Nor about the laws that we assign it.
55d1aadb-1dec-44ae-aba2-7bd0fa333d5d|He's not gonna let this go, nor should he.
08658b06-2f04-4918-a50a-5e29a1f805a4|She -- she loves modern art.
94f9c50f-07bc-4553-ac5f-37b5978b9808|But perhaps too modern for this country.
8d03b8e7-2b49-47f2-a991-fedcbc1593f2|Why don't they put something modern on it?
5a3225da-be3f-45e5-9acd-b2bf88f48d9c|I think you're the modern voice of food today.
7f75586c-3d64-418d-a81a-16843f171aaf|He shouldn't be a part of this vote.
603c5222-5085-4f80-b8b2-3de50637f03f|I'm afraid it's a no vote.
ab424478-5bf0-4dde-b316-a864b3afb137|What are these votes for?
40b6bc3a-8fd4-45da-b636-6fbc391e1722|'Cause I can see everyone's vote.
486edb34-8661-4308-ace0-6369cbeb39c8|So why don't you just sing?
35bf7a43-720c-4973-8ab9-52b8eaf977f0|But you didn't get to sing your song together.
ea42ef9f-281a-49ab-bcfe-f74ad32858db|She sang with me, back then.
5caa94d7-be4e-4ebf-9e69-8916d52af52c|Do you have to sing all the time?
5203bed3-64db-4704-9e00-45f187c79deb|I thought you said she could sing.
1f03ee64-8f4d-4a9e-99d4-5b09bcc0339d|One, take my chances and never get cancer.
4def9355-e5bb-4378-bc0b-2379e8cb6fa1|Yes, Pete, I have cancer.
75e1cc7b-6eaa-490c-9009-93d170599d3a|Something's wrong, but it's not cancer.
06996ef7-cef6-4093-b4a2-dd69d213cbdd|She moves pretty good for a cancer patient.
823b91e1-e540-461e-a72b-508706c36b33|I'd shake your hand, but I have cancer.
8be3eebb-ffee-4a44-866f-cc692cc1ea48|Give me that, before you lose a finger.
eaf65790-0921-4d87-a1b2-30d4994260fe|I broke his fingers and that was that.
9baf3d97-a9e2-4c5a-9c12-a54af4c93adb|Don't worry, just stick out your finger.
04cbef06-12be-4779-a9b9-7765b0f2b793|I can't put my finger on you.
eacf8277-6e59-47b4-9788-679be299303d|Just you and me at your parents' lake house?
ffd3c440-28ef-43dd-b9bd-694622ddfad7|We want to wish you good luck today.
cfe32a27-56ef-49c2-b936-86744cdf8339|I wish I could work you out.
b9c772ab-e4de-4e12-ba7e-af06dc98d330|I wish we could get out more often.
1cb68ecd-d78c-4a20-8097-c8cb4d679c16|I so wish for one.
4c3c73b4-4c8a-46c3-8307-a3b61bb38f3e|Now, son, we both know that marriage is hard.
7640efff-c7b2-4771-8088-3b194af66b9b|You mean about sex or about marriage?
2e29dfa9-bb70-4283-9171-9e1bf308b136|Didn't you ask her advice before your marriage?
49a3bcc9-c67c-4343-8b39-1ef055e41479|Haven't you ever thought about marriage, even once?
4df6375d-85ce-4c8f-8972-52b7b0c18534|Why do you assume their marriage is over?
b233a9e6-aed3-49b9-bb4c-0bfa4798f438|It'll tell us who the victim is.
f12283b1-4570-410c-8025-710da41d55db|I think I know how the victim was killed.
ec78ff41-20d7-41d9-8c2f-9d0668bcf219|Yeah, I was never a victim.
32bd2af7-07c4-49b0-bb91-270c43494081|You think one of these killed our victims?
b5756929-2b45-4429-9512-f9929ef9a0a0|This is the most important task at hand.
a8c7b08e-9bc0-4e72-baeb-6840a2e2606e|I was too focused on the task at hand.
d93f33ab-124c-4b4e-9620-4e8d59bb05b4|Like they're off on another task or something.
cb6731ef-ee4f-4037-88b7-c4ac2e6733de|Last time you were down at the yard?
673d936b-6748-432c-a02b-af04b34aedc8|Ron, there's guys all over the front yard.
2cee7a41-442b-4acc-8cf7-0a102c3e599b|I saw each body found on the prison yard.
0c3162b4-9141-49f9-8652-24c036894973|I haven't shown you the kitchen.
62633b74-7015-4501-83ac-73958d775a2a|I just want to be back in the kitchen.
3589022f-50a9-4073-8697-26c878d7f36d|Do you remember seeing anything unusual in the kitchen?
ffcfdadf-5ebe-48a4-b431-abd751a4b549|It's through the kitchen, on your right.
5b0b7cc1-1cc4-4f12-a270-38da9391d182|We give loans only against items of general value.
31910007-551d-426f-9565-98a0b5880bfe|Me and Derek were quite an item, you know.
5a56ddd6-8c0a-4343-8119-4d05f9462ab8|I'm down to my last item.
5c20e1c5-3695-4215-a4f5-7855d2508942|And you need to keep your mouth shut!
ad8a93ff-d479-4cc9-ba8a-035906e22126|Your mouth moved, your hand didn't.
b13b3e44-f8a8-444e-98e2-236a405bc516|Those words did not come out of your mouth.
9da11324-b46b-4f56-a5d2-969afa6f4402|Yeah, I had a hard time closing my mouth.
f3cd875e-6c1e-44df-ae5b-ff477d405b21|You've taken the words right out of my mouth.
5737f556-b473-465a-8e85-da628a8ea72f|So, I will let you out of our agreement.
e06cfd1e-0030-43e4-b4c6-5ed42b146b46|But you didn't keep our agreement.
fbc801a7-11b0-4033-b19f-468527b1ab0b|Unless you have entered into an agreement with them.
3167eb45-3a92-4fb1-aa0a-90451f6c1f3c|Oh, and terms of service agreement.
ed228cfe-d37c-4aa1-ad0d-030755f470de|Because no one is in complete agreement with himself.
d90bc683-356d-4eb0-b441-1529f185abe0|She also lied to the district attorney's office.
0a25f1a1-6941-43e0-86c1-48d675c56be0|You can show my attorney in now.
402872e5-bbc6-4701-bf97-7b172f38d8c1|I'm not gonna be your attorney on this one.
a4ec4e85-4a30-41ae-ab07-557bfc23d200|Which are larger, capital letters or smaller letters?
c99106d0-c4ab-47a8-b7e5-dc6ee483ec1f|Isn't rice from the capital pretty?
3531274e-3616-4b41-a0a6-9a833a269e0f|Why do you think they're going to the capital?
2395f1ed-e560-4e09-84fe-58a8ee82cd47|We may have found our threat, Harold.
a0eb29a9-8993-4dab-b48e-1fd6534315b2|You don't believe the threat is real?
e35ea147-8a1e-4d3e-826f-1e60281458e6|Last time we saw you, you weren't smiling.
11653ce0-ff10-4a10-8706-f966bc5e7137|You only smiled four times.
9fc3ee63-6b18-4b85-98d6-f133c581715c|When he smiled, you could see it.
8e351847-80f6-45b1-9614-f5dfbd5af3cb|The gas and water plants are closed.
67ac16ba-17b4-44cc-85f6-b3b75beeb303|Go, give it some gas.
8990e258-adbd-4030-921a-937b8d801201|I just put gas in it.
878adc7a-9e15-4631-9988-14458da5737a|Don't worry, we'll go to a gas station.
f86a7e75-d494-4276-a16e-3ac2694c9a07|He still has more gas than us.
ff004a33-ae07-4f3f-85db-ed2d85a6e042|I wish we could be more positive.
ac43c021-0264-48e4-96b8-5cd5a463210d|A positive test means she tried it once.
647b2dd1-d0ea-4a2f-8b1c-f7dae943d755|But I see that as a positive, all right?
42294311-b9d1-4f8f-a2a4-19fa5f6812ef|Seems you've made some very positive impressions here.
a1fe388b-eb02-484a-9f6a-bca87cee4ee5|These tracks look pretty fresh.
9ea6529e-5507-4248-b6f9-d209d52097a6|He might have just lost track of time.
6793e736-8a6f-4282-9e46-54d918255f9c|I don't keep track of my boys.
0b8b7295-9c03-4bda-abc6-850275595849|Now I've got to get you back on track.
1775f195-8116-4247-9492-335babf8dfcb|Then why you opening a banking account with them?
26cfabb2-c9d4-4d06-8a4f-92705570a5ce|Susan, that place is one of my accounts.
9d6f765d-3e88-4a24-92d9-880c23488654|And haven't taken you into account.
f8d13883-734f-4cdd-9694-67ec639f86f4|There was no break in.
5993d0a7-bbcf-465d-aab9-b8502661005a|It's a nice break from my life.
c20c1ef8-3522-4263-8ab4-66d758b52a1a|But three years ago, he needed a break.
a121ffc2-80b9-41f5-9a31-38409e0b6d8d|She's going to take a little break.
32c0e06a-fa8e-4ba2-a747-022a09ea6dc2|Is that what rich people are like?
1b96f401-d8c5-4e2b-b2d4-2a157b85a580|Your boys know how rich they're gonna be?
970606db-2211-4bd0-9766-962d93cd7608|Too bad one of us doesn't know somebody rich.
66dcbf0f-b469-4d65-9cfa-05d8e9e87a23|What's wrong with rich people?
a20fba74-eacf-4f7e-8c79-872e459566d4|He would have burned every one of his citizens.
3f26242e-f3bd-4889-9e97-731946c3b22d|I've sought an audience, but I'm turned away.
4169cc24-8ad4-41ea-a124-78b1e190bd02|Everyone in that studio audience is dead now.
db260708-12cb-4192-b02a-7c3b3f8299af|It looks like an old lady lives here.
55489783-6026-4ca2-bb66-21849f87c94b|A lady brought this for you, sir.
7c46108a-9bd8-4869-9447-3814ad030b59|It's for dinner at our place Saturday night.
17bbd834-88dc-4921-82f4-b40c6ef4653f|I see you had dinner.
7e67b585-a26d-4914-90b7-5af8f963947d|We will watch together after dinner.
1a387af3-c635-4106-a5db-e2d9ae06117b|At least let me take you to dinner.
81c84515-9a20-4307-9c3c-3a0731495c8e|You're too fixed on Western medicine.
31d09048-a379-49f3-91f5-407a86e46b17|Everything we have on friendly Western agents in Russia.
eaeae12c-e1d2-403a-bef0-b467d77d6011|Yeah, like we're in a western.
71caef30-5236-48ab-a2de-780604fda761|There ain't much room for debate, Kelly.
f9a45ef6-cf64-47c7-b9d5-31a127240b27|We have to make her think that we're debating.
d2f360ab-6c08-45e2-8515-148829fd73ac|This one is not even up for debate.
f7d5d52f-8c4a-439f-b16a-0eb2c7ff7ca9|And where we at on the debates?
87cbf302-f3d8-4dec-be11-153e5a8bb3b9|Well, you can thank rising consumer confidence for that.
7481436c-8337-4442-8912-3f3cfe242ddd|He's creating a need in the consumer's mind.
2f205b30-a9a8-47a2-80be-efee3cf15c2d|I'm speaking for the majority leader.
2e438b99-f604-4012-8ecd-66ef55ef6cd0|We still own majority shares.
98483384-6dea-42db-9e49-0463368c503c|No, what's interesting is you never told me that.
b71d8224-7467-47f6-9523-e24039c8541f|It's always interesting when he gets like this.
4bffdc3e-e183-48a5-9963-018f093a081d|And now it starts to get interesting.
72acb360-5840-4a24-a02d-5616e46e8e98|There are some really interesting facts here.
9df98569-e663-46c7-a3ed-e6a92880cd86|It's a plan that interesting people make.
6cf866ca-1058-44c0-a781-017a9cbadacc|Interesting answers get points and obvious answers get penalties.
4f031b3b-09ca-4698-84f7-3e4fb0e6bd4c|Interesting weapons these humans use.
db63bcfd-5225-42bc-85b5-4e3b1d8b6bc9|Interesting role model for you.
13731e06-2505-4b68-8a82-91ce91f7434b|This is what I was trying to prevent.
e8da64d8-9616-434b-afc9-6b98195f65a4|Well, we want to prevent that from happening.
efb4a3a5-a2b7-47f0-90d7-50bc443b5649|Only you can prevent this future from happening.
207a5bff-eb08-4da5-b004-33e9724127e3|You have always felt you must travel the world.
ec80e63f-0b43-48c4-8735-9bd5b791e378|She had to travel for work.
5df2491e-ab14-4d87-8b45-9d55dcceb502|Yeah, we had plans to travel, you see.
b97c8f76-0efa-414a-b5fb-7a663f08d957|We're going travelling next year.
5df80edb-4563-48d9-a1b4-b1466ca33c4c|Not a bad way to travel, is it?
8abb65bf-f56f-4805-91c4-5d3a8fb09fd5|And I saw my kids being born.
bc66e5ac-b134-4b88-8f80-f661656204e7|It was the whole point of me being born.
3b41c1e2-1cf6-4031-8a46-dc17e183ea62|They said she died just after he was born.
a7c4a941-7e8f-4bdb-9170-cde6d7d57ad2|I always say that I was born too late.
48108a4c-f0c4-427f-8950-145a31398e66|Has anyone actually been born here?
34f6ae51-f5d9-4cb3-acc0-d0013e15f7c5|Could it be drug related?
a09264e2-aeeb-4518-8c25-9d625deaf744|What if I told you that we're related?
8e13bd5b-5e73-4071-b660-7bcb14445dd3|Let's say I can relate.
892b0bea-ec81-4387-9140-ce9998f5516c|You'll realize just about everyone's related.
3b63faa8-0c94-4a8e-ae1b-1a6b101d23ac|So, you think these crimes are related?
6c057139-d7e3-4b23-8652-df8e997afd1e|Can I assume you're back on the team?
10709ff6-cced-4761-8d5d-2910cef23f99|I mean, I assume you're gonna be running, right?
babd23cd-3708-4e82-8111-0d38528be464|Assuming that the machine saw the threat, yes.
3ec4305f-9f77-46cb-9f62-bfb3e362395a|I assume she heard that last shot.
1907fc3d-54e9-4aaf-9698-8503dc2d7af7|None of them were on the guest list.
0560239c-60a3-46f9-92b1-e3e258501487|And none of you can kill me.
8df45ad1-6602-42c4-8852-ef406114c452|None shall lay a hand on you again.
66f90fb5-1373-4555-81ab-6597cb515e85|I have to admit that takes skill.
4b0ad58c-4934-4c9b-b671-3cdb21212cf0|No, I'm not going to admit to anything.
604f3478-2d14-41b8-845b-60f40bc50367|I got a feeling you'll figure it out.
a36ac285-d8dc-445f-87e9-22fa9c170134|I figure it's a good place to lay low.
27c5487f-df4f-4b1e-ba48-f2db7ee04b24|I think I got it figured out.
7c208b9a-7462-4377-aab3-11e3daa0871f|I figured she would come.
7f0c88c4-0479-48b6-af0e-07eea8a5f2a4|That's too bad you just figured that out.
24011fa2-fc7c-4be5-b6bb-9504024c3271|See if your coaches can offer any help.
c9dee1ad-1663-4066-9a88-fee8eb365708|Oh, coach said he's gonna start next week.
38ba747a-8f41-458b-a567-20e83c64b977|Will the coaches fall for his country sound?
220e947c-0c9c-4801-bbf8-ef762dbff853|That's part of what a coach does.
d3cc1a62-e31b-4308-9f19-7f7641a0e257|What you got on my partner?
07297fe1-2df8-4372-b7c0-64094f06b28f|What are you doing here, partner?
b8590bbd-5d10-489a-8aa0-8ed52807f65d|Maybe he was working with a partner.
25c632aa-422a-4a6e-9748-4e9fc3f8474a|But they'd never let a woman be partner.
f29a7a73-8236-4284-b906-d5b7672be7bc|Have you ever lost a partner?
9bb4cdb9-4ef1-4e53-a784-57c4884d6341|I was out of there like a shot.
aa4219b9-6714-4427-85b0-329c6dc11ae5|Long shot, but we'll check it out.
d52d6dd6-5540-4522-b98a-25b89ac85262|Just let me take another shot.
ecc86b25-fc46-447c-8915-17a75c368631|This is your one shot to get her back.
9ad3925f-4381-40e5-a4f0-790816829ef4|Michael and I decided to give it another shot.
e6e429b8-13be-4440-a8aa-c3439a6eba47|You like that I'm a scientist?
76b204e0-bf93-441f-bb4c-63dc75270e27|I thought you were a scientist.
842bda4e-9f9c-4fe1-be25-2fc07718e27d|Sometimes a scientist can get caught up in theories.
84520ae1-6668-4756-ae20-26be7f48747a|You gave him up to the senior partners.
46ae9ee7-d124-4659-8b1d-c6e6cf5a7915|Vote for Steve for senior class president.
9bf0b7dc-8799-4c97-a0ef-e7c5d5fd41a8|Isn't your sister Maria the senior?
b940f5f0-e162-4e8c-878a-d8701ddb2309|Man, I wish I was still a senior.
3abe690a-165c-4a55-ba8b-3ad2e1bbae99|You know how much you've made me suffer?
c67fb3f2-f3f6-40d0-b134-76ea2f1a01c4|I know what I fucking suffered!
232317c0-a305-491f-86c6-c856f288aa5a|But she can't suffer like this.
2c62fc80-4982-4278-8745-3c37e786607b|I think I could suffer through that.
6a63f9ff-ed24-4cf3-a1b9-7c6362b5636e|We're still suffering for it.
5a2aff32-45a4-4288-afba-bac24132b961|Why can't she leave me alone?
d65a26a0-0c2d-4f25-ab6b-634e0409c078|Leave my father alone bastard!
82befc42-ef59-4f0c-a53d-e7cd8339c627|I don't know how to sleep alone.
f81eb715-4b2f-4868-a4a9-0e8b4754e5d5|Don't leave me alone up here!
e098db20-1d2d-42eb-8837-812a2c7c3469|That's why I can't leave this alone.
62791fc3-bf8c-4a67-9828-21d066478a7f|Keith will not travel without his entire collection.
0acaa0f4-ac43-4858-8075-358447578f43|I'm working on my first collection of poems.
2b91826a-8c5c-4acc-952e-c4bb46fbbbde|So that our futures are separate but successful futures.
750f9896-484a-452b-a1cc-815359d7de6f|She's been successful doing it her way.
dfe4e2c1-6b69-4634-965a-27b9714d4f8a|Do you think your plan will be successful?
a4a0d886-6837-472a-8070-2328c5437a03|And I believe it will be successful.
8dc5e1a6-0a5e-48eb-a661-a2a7c8bf1dae|That's what being a successful manager does for you.
dbf2f851-d57c-41ac-a833-a77d238b8312|We'll have missed the speeches as it is.
1021fac2-7a5f-4030-ba3e-b449e601e954|I need to practice my speech for tomorrow.
00ad9fe7-6ec4-4481-8df0-9aa069c4041a|That was a beautiful, beautiful speech.
ae32b082-63bb-4a32-b451-5f13ce7087b7|You have picked up his speech patterns.
49e0da69-8e5e-44a7-80ef-b6ad50e56fe0|I got to get that key card.
d119f7c4-5391-439f-9e3c-1022f403a396|But nobody has the key to that room.
bceb689a-3f1d-405a-bd75-a16d530e69d5|And perhaps it's the key to him.
ec79a7f3-8a3c-4741-9842-15dc5189ce4f|I only know the key players.
81e6c14d-3ee2-4388-8cdf-9e88cb7becea|Because it's my mission in life to destroy you.
bf83952b-47ea-4a9c-895a-3beb0c9f9c3a|No, this is my mission.
9b880ea3-ba3f-4364-90a3-226d6e35adc7|And it's all for the mission?
dbac75ae-35f8-4799-8ee9-b56fef57119c|You have your next mission.
179f6dcc-d50d-4b9c-bab8-f257e6c2f239|And you were about to expose our biggest score.
8962eb9f-ebe7-4af5-85a1-238a0dc6091c|That's one hell of a high score.
4700a9cf-fbef-489b-ba29-2061ffe453e0|He was pulling scores with.
3574698b-f3b9-48dc-a53a-0a376ca0f97d|I had the high score for two months.
16697f7d-db0c-4f5c-b863-d988f9c27535|And in that newspaper, I found this.
013e953b-ba24-470c-8860-89eeb8d8dfc5|I lay myself turned to the wind, like this.
7e102582-fbf8-486b-a690-324241169332|How did you get your old wound?
a7e5c370-5bdb-47e1-a987-25260bf22eb2|Power must have gone out due to the winds.
44aec14a-901e-470a-9830-7d3a5ed05a15|I don't buy that reform story.
1994d270-d4b3-4641-91df-2c15ef61cecb|And the land reform, it was?
9781d1a7-bec1-4701-9e69-864c276cf48f|They sent me to reform school.
de5aded6-1a00-4553-9c09-5640ca035355|We're still falling back, trying to reform our lines.
c3a9e61b-0ea1-4470-bbcd-9d4445968618|Everyone being so kind and concerned.
9f0ee03e-33ad-4b55-83c5-8fccf0a8ae4a|He's only concerned with his own safety.
2eb43637-fb47-403a-b94c-ccbc7b880b61|You must be very concerned.
cb579cf4-b401-4ec3-8d92-aa9f263f85ee|As far as everyone's concerned, she's retired.
d8a85c3b-3018-4663-9a0f-c637ef14bf59|You better figure it out, for all concerned.
d065ed2a-37c0-48d5-8488-bec39d0fda58|As far as I'm concerned, you're a client.
151d34c0-c9b8-4d72-82e3-9b8e2eb84851|We won as far as money's concerned.
9b39629c-8c63-4c2a-a087-d92c780dac4b|I'm concerned about your health.
7a402ce4-fc8a-4b51-8831-2fe8a6d4024b|We're concerned he'll kill one of our men.
38b73662-bb1e-4625-a7d5-ef7d848efe92|I am concerned about her.
2e6f0b10-e676-405e-b01c-bfd3b26437dd|We are the poor relations at best.
3e0f6f9f-7837-42ff-b83d-3b7f6dd42176|We don't have relations with our animals.
4ae44a08-bc72-4e63-b22b-fc2af4133e3c|What were your relations with them?
95b6fd36-29b0-494e-abe6-a3b2d3cb474d|I imagined it as a new relation to work.
6f616ed6-eede-4973-89aa-eb03e257fae1|We don't want any troops around.
df8887e4-6a18-46d0-8483-af5b61e3aa62|You're not gonna like where he's gathering his troops.
96ade50d-2d9f-4605-a588-bb12e8fb0cf3|All of a sudden, you're bringing the troops home.
200abf66-b45c-443c-b75c-efd73dc15591|Why aren't you sending in support troops?
884ba416-1b98-4b0c-9f4e-bcbe9f72c38b|My troops have been fighting for days.
ff48fdb9-48a7-4858-a4c8-6eca0235281f|They buy benches for their gardens.
914a7ff3-3900-4767-8caf-373371fa1d5f|I must say, I like having a garden.
035e9374-4e7e-4b46-9d6c-5d7b51487a85|Oh, look, you have some in your garden.
ccd2fadc-35be-4c10-94f8-74cee8e876b4|Can you access that drive?
bddaa4f0-ef06-4701-8094-91b8f0995896|How many books have you published now?
83714614-c44c-49aa-b0a3-8cf2791ca161|That's because we never published it.
b545327b-e63e-4163-8c7f-0cbff3e2b20f|If you can have that published at once.
974a7fcb-ad0f-497b-afeb-8ae6900f2968|How come they don't publish it?
fb2ecea0-692c-4c8d-9e73-c2e593066246|I don't seem to recall that case.
294e80b4-9500-4662-ac8a-2fbcce92e36a|Do you recall which one?
680dad1d-a44c-4fc6-92e1-b85cb271531c|I don't recall stopping by here to kill anyone.
4b018247-94a7-498f-b043-6de51d8a5506|Do you recall what happened that night?
9ec278f3-2e29-4055-8c0e-1f8fe503efdb|I demand to be judged by the Soviet law!
d312d32e-f0f5-4dfe-9e27-cc123b32e50c|Do I look like a Soviet agent to you?
582270e7-7386-4233-8896-a8619668b3ea|It's the Soviet division, everything gets done right.
eacba9df-abd9-43ec-8d27-179a8eede0ff|I am travelling under Soviet orders.
0103f30f-2772-4729-bee3-c38a0361a3db|What a Soviet tank doing in America?
c601e832-b5ec-4c10-b6c9-c5a0a73b3e2e|You do not think it costs?
afedd653-7cb7-42bc-90cc-0d7748fbc620|It doesn't matter what it costs.
10f04cd5-e0c5-412b-b5ff-28adde8fa3cf|What she's asking will cost far more than that.
7996084c-a124-42e0-860f-4452a0aea380|But it's going to cost you more.
f9f69893-db06-4259-8705-9a343edf6c31|The southern part's always the best part of anything.
d687feca-3349-40df-be83-6adffba9f4bd|You should've seen what happened in the senate.
b1b87d92-098b-484f-ac56-d8767f97a5f0|I urge you to speak before the full senate.
fe997c45-d451-456d-a08d-7c27e7e116d8|What other opinion would it be?
59d142ad-8b8f-488d-8c71-28c66330c442|Think I'm standing here waiting for your opinion?
4d7ad78c-73cb-41f5-8d07-b6e764f3a19d|You asked my opinion, I gave it.
731922ac-70a7-49fe-8818-67df9962078d|I like people who stand by their opinions.
47d494f7-eba7-4e49-9a4f-feecb4375734|What's your opinion so far?
82c14ee8-fa0a-4171-844e-9c7422eb0fa4|Because you two don't have a better option.
552cddbe-4e27-479d-b482-d3a6bbdd6f55|Buses like these seem to be the only option.
dde101c9-1b94-453d-8db5-dd642565b2c8|You're all acting like there's only two options.
04dfd9f6-e959-472f-b686-8ac1f2ce4396|I don't get that option, do I?
4062929d-e83a-4425-8a10-14690c26ad7d|Why don't you let me judge for myself?
5d6f4b17-337e-481d-827a-16a330cdc56c|That's exactly what the judge gave him.
42fc61bc-6a70-4a18-8f78-34598f60d1ca|And it's in the judges' hands at this point.
d296e429-21e7-4b69-b910-66fcea08e86c|But the judge threw it out.
36777ec3-3c94-4e86-904e-a16b542470f7|You took my family and the judge.
feb1c27b-4ba4-4701-b2e4-3104de005cb8|Well, it's not an original, you know.
d6aa60b0-9afe-4c8b-8f22-b49fc08f9c60|This is the original report from the original murders.
e76d4776-b71b-40e7-97cc-b246678cf27a|This must be original Miranda's house.
270cea85-2f3e-45e9-8806-c8c32e39669d|There will be no more customers tonight.
9225886f-0db0-44c7-bed5-b29bddba624e|Are you allowed to do this to a customer?
15c8be5b-4692-4b30-ba77-5f45e3535d10|I should go help that customer.
efcc533b-2655-4270-8d17-5e55ecc97fc1|I do feel like I'm good with the customers.
ed4c7df6-c19e-4f53-857a-0327285c6898|Is that man one of your customers?
d9d66b68-364d-47c3-8f10-2fa6d1f01533|She's in critical care, under police guard.
d55dec2c-5643-4c17-aa61-209c0d41daee|We're at a critical stage in testing.
6bd11337-91ca-46d7-98e4-dc7e49913940|Are we really still critical of working moms?
c2e953c3-2f88-4915-9ae7-dd68affe0e75|I mean how many corners do we need ?
bb47fc7c-ed39-4fa8-a91a-1cfa02ef2226|It will spread to every corner of the land.
6d069bc9-e8b6-4a21-887e-b954fb8338f5|You watched out of the corner of your eyes.
bad3a248-b02e-4855-b92d-d2087f09dfbe|And coming up now to the first corner.
99df0272-b37a-44ce-9b10-8335667fa3fd|You are the basic truth in us.
ddc24305-7861-4fe1-ac9d-8e844cf46b92|I passed in basic training.
de04da87-ba3d-4566-9cd5-6c4f69fd9d70|It was pretty basic, wasn't it?
4b175cf9-ba5a-4891-a229-4ccb1ab95dac|I've filled out the basic form.
21048421-b591-44f0-9c06-7074bd0e330e|How many on that list are single income?
12d97cea-7955-4027-b493-fda115767cc9|How did your husband come by this income?
7425166e-6617-4a05-af80-68b3d09baf04|People in my age don't have income.
1c70232e-f404-4dcc-b208-7dc8593026e8|You don't even have a source of income.
a13202bd-82bd-4007-b261-4c7142f40dd8|But you didn't kill your Mom directly.
63554924-096a-417c-8efe-ffa07281b6d6|Does it go directly into his ears?
8ea9b49c-8648-4acf-884d-4dd153a0959c|It was directly across from his room.
c0f3a0c9-8d45-4e54-b263-4188326a40a7|Is there any way I can get you directly?
83f344ac-ba4b-4674-a695-72c05dda4270|No, but I would have told them directly.
3eaab52c-2420-4702-bac7-940dc9380d8d|Can't steal anything if nobody owns it.
14745175-66e5-42a0-9507-4ddca21494e5|Oh, I don't own this apartment.
7af8e1f4-33aa-407f-bad4-1d7dd593032d|Why can't I own you?
8c635f10-2062-407e-8ce8-0f5e01202f2d|He was released five months ago.
64164b96-9f1b-40f3-9a7c-5d096c1d63a9|Or released, at any rate.
c96cb577-d2c2-435d-a3c6-a837e2959b76|Release us immediately, or we will open fire.
26ed7854-093c-4bd8-85de-589c214efaff|Maybe this restaurant won't be a huge success.
14d7436a-d3f3-4624-b27a-814a560e853a|And it is in front of my restaurant.
dc6e84c2-6be2-44a5-82cf-cacd051a9234|Oh, went to the restaurant last week.
f39db840-b65e-4540-bf01-c8205e28b525|There is a good restaurant over there.
759fd90c-2cd1-4cb9-9ec1-2fb32a5f4ab1|I think she lives in this neighborhood.
5ca17e4a-d753-41f0-a267-c0392bdbf18a|Just doing my part in the neighborhood watch.
b199c732-e8b8-4147-a556-1e1102e370d4|She said it'd be in this neighborhood.
e53d200a-e3cb-4117-a75c-8e55912764df|Look, in this neighborhood, we don't talk to police.
23105ddc-959b-4822-b372-06f3166f4d27|The program has been effective, sir.
8dcc64b5-c536-47d6-b7c5-47b860209f17|If you could assume those duties, effective immediately?
997d9b0c-9baf-495c-b16c-fff456afcfce|I didn't expect it to be that effective.
d4745751-b124-4332-afa0-782e334105b4|Angela, are you in labor?
9395daea-5f79-49f2-861d-8a09cf90e5c9|These two must have done some heavy labor.
376399f0-c51e-4bca-957c-8df6b3136d28|What if she is going into labor?
a968beee-6682-4d1a-9297-ed523cd388ec|It could prevent her from going into labor again.
820902d5-d572-4179-9753-95ba4f143fb9|She's missing the fruits of her labor.
5bf188fa-20d8-4f98-b64a-3390bcef59c9|Nobody could ask any more of you.
54ff2027-c42c-4781-b0a5-6674f1cc5a1e|I've tried to call home, but nobody answered.
14a0e2d9-536a-4864-84c3-abbfeb5b2870|This is back when nobody knew who she was.
43ad5fd7-7fae-4d8a-aad7-525be39b3b1a|Nobody told me what happened to my father.
7033e1c0-393a-4baa-b43e-53a162305ef4|I'm sorry, but there's nobody here by that name.
b277f692-0a6a-40a0-88d7-c934e8131fa0|Why is he staring at us all the time?
76f74ea0-acf1-4fea-be07-a5fd69a730a4|He's just staring into her eyes.
58106be1-96ac-44c5-8a71-319ea43412c6|You don't have to stare at it.
21377313-602d-4f37-9465-0add30c5da93|I just hate them staring at you.
ec9c7764-9a19-4836-9e13-11f4f261e16f|Well, go ahead and let them stare.
17f1a086-8751-4775-bd22-57edffbb5d5a|You get that thing off the grounds immediately!
5c409b9d-276e-433d-867d-d65cd101c634|I immediately want to know where it is!
95bbe3cc-f108-4e50-8a44-41f45011ccac|We need to go to the hospital immediately.
dd20a3b8-ee8c-493e-accd-444668d5ce64|You have to get everyone out of there immediately.
a2872876-a8e2-4132-8703-5f033c3484de|I immediately noticed that his face.
0f58d32a-4535-49f3-a5b4-d44c3119fa2f|I want you to be happy, however that's achieved.
34295805-eac6-4d9c-991c-ea2889108a2b|You have achieved a great success.
633fd104-ef60-4a02-9ea4-f9d7a4d9b08c|What on earth are you hoping to achieve?
d80aaa8d-3b1a-4a46-9ef2-b232acf9505b|What do you hope to achieve by this?
5191141a-0226-4339-8fed-c81bfdd8e3ea|In the forest for all that time.
4d34f6c7-646f-40d3-85be-4865741a80cd|True, it was a beautiful forest.
eb3d68d2-ddcc-4d40-9f14-3ebfb263e088|Yeah, but those people are killing the forest.
c28fcdbe-b961-419e-8f69-03118a35f66b|The big one said he was my dad.
6b2d594e-8daa-408c-adb4-8b98ddb987cb|If dad doesn't like it, it's not happening.
a8a8da32-d29b-4e11-a124-401ca48347bd|Would you like it if I were your dad?
1080717b-c0ea-454a-bcec-19368b81088f|Why would I talk to my dad?
ff285ef9-bd3f-42ea-a61d-d96f8a5cd237|It's because my eyes hurt.
be811af8-56f2-48ee-8c9d-3c5353d8a9c4|I'm afraid he'll get hurt.
c97223c5-6440-4d0a-ac79-4c029b14c397|Well, I'm sorry if that hurts your feelings.
ddc67774-2de7-4c8f-b062-b9d13c8dce73|Okay, just don't hurt us, man.
415c29e6-a5c1-43a0-b1b2-ec396ef17cfc|Then you do a little dance from the video.
24efab94-b8af-4b25-bb7d-b3d19921f081|Has anyone been here asking about security videos?
f086e7de-707f-4656-bb6d-e804d6611815|Is this about more than your video game?
4ba8893e-8665-4748-abde-34aaf5f40ee0|We have it all on video.
d6d849c9-1bcd-4d82-8622-cf700d4e91f3|Guess we're not the only ones that struck out?
4cc18ae7-c33f-4b67-9b4c-4909bb7136fa|We strike when it returns for the bodies.
77f917d9-fe5c-4f02-b9e6-2631f6a438a5|How did it strike you?
51e331aa-510a-477c-a021-b6b3753d878b|How do you know when he'll strike?
202be40f-98eb-44f1-8a1b-d46888a9e6fc|I only lie when someone's safety is at risk.
f522b477-9bc8-4875-bd5b-03e1f37c7d01|Looks like you've got the safety off.
98c6bcfa-3c46-4361-a723-0c46ca438f52|You kill a cop, it's a job safety issue.
87f2d9ca-50bb-427f-8923-08c019c0420b|I sure hope it's not a safety issue.
601d2ec1-476f-40e7-b1c2-869016c8e3c4|Are you absolutely positive there's nothing going on?
9d0772aa-a2e9-435e-9e5b-35bdecf53cb1|I have absolutely no idea who that is.
eeb8e319-1dad-4ae0-b7c4-c891fd25d2f5|There is absolutely nothing to support that.
a6eb239a-ef5f-4c67-aae9-3cbf9698b46d|And how absolutely perfect for me.
6b9bce38-9bc0-4659-82dc-00768531b40c|Do not travel unless you absolutely have to.
9e750259-3ec3-4ddf-b581-f2aaaf1b40d0|And therefore, I do not believe in you.
251988b9-987e-4494-9d0e-ae69854b021b|Therefore, people were surprised When she killed herself.
a99d259e-b7c8-4740-8038-10f33d9ac135|Well it has happened, therefore it is a fact.
68e5d10b-65d9-4919-adf9-2a4e55d3ebc2|It works, therefore it's good.
c07e3c41-c6ee-43de-b452-34c0c9784c7b|We therefore commit its body to the ground.
6ee21780-cddd-419e-bd67-dcdda5c3ed80|Having the freedom to wear something different every day.
b01f6ee7-2c5a-451f-aef6-d155b2bccb27|This could be your ticket to freedom.
d3a25683-3b90-49cf-af55-f0012d1a752d|Those who hate us for our freedoms.
30d8684f-7c70-4026-b71c-c33300a85001|You know, the new version of the band.
ea507168-26e3-48b0-a8ea-29784b235be9|This isn't a good version of me?
3b303b13-fbc8-4d51-91f9-df502a3697bf|No, no, no, in this version.
3dd3bc13-c5ec-4ad9-b045-b4469c710e08|Oh, well, that's this world's version of him.
e4d6a113-098f-47de-9767-39ab154afd14|And I do not have to catch a plane.
8c7a98ce-7798-465f-a572-d5e494229b69|My husband didn't even hear the planes.
4871dd4d-991f-408d-b939-82f9051ae086|You could call your lawyer from the plane.
4fc79b30-7d49-4423-8372-6045ebc1ed7d|She caught the next plane out of there.
1b5c5494-ba6e-46d0-b2b7-bbebb9ea67e7|Now, that's the kind of attitude this station needs.
c70cc43c-aa46-4531-8409-4b5f4db86241|Because they didn't like our attitude?
c60af2b7-9924-4f0a-b21d-d55d890d52be|Yeah, see, that's a winning attitude.
6435f51f-518b-482b-8534-5e99e24b739e|What's wrong with your phone answering attitude?
3206da66-5451-4868-8b2a-6c5b9fa77d09|That doesn't sound like the right attitude.
3b646229-55f8-49f1-9da3-90181b403358|Did you have sexual relations?
8208292d-3c78-49c9-b24a-dd3a8d6df451|Did you have sexual relations with her?
bd550a6b-ab7b-48f3-a796-a652b1ecae41|To what exactly are you referring?
dc97f23b-a372-487f-95c9-1d6bbe646340|But, however, it isn't that to which I refer.
9f0d0fa1-5e3c-442b-96e2-ca836596b898|Guys, I think he was referring to me.
4a383cb1-3812-41dc-90b6-120d549b07a0|Well, this is about as fresh as it gets.
40d54b08-f1cc-41bd-bf8d-7e9388f2ad71|I mean, we need a fresh face here.
0fb85b01-fec2-4d78-ad2f-4d94beaf6230|Well, there is no fresh side.
93811260-89f9-414f-866a-a803510c4f55|I guess it wasn't too fresh.
effd20c8-dfae-4f33-b335-3e192c3166d7|I was stronger than you when fresh from school.
fcffa185-a06d-4442-aa4c-f5725d2f2992|I'm not getting involved, find someone else.
1411fd8e-849f-47e8-ac0a-a0024682e6db|Well, it's a lot more involved than that, Rick.
e6da1c6c-6cea-4294-b4b0-38eca2d73a95|Only if there's a cup of tea involved.
fbf9687d-af6f-4445-be7b-cb93cbda8a4c|With the most powerful weapon out there.
14173b32-24e7-4188-afa0-93daa530bfc5|You are going to be a very powerful man.
7ba028a3-d01f-4a6f-81dd-1035f5b116f1|And yet which piece is most powerful?
45b162e8-68ae-4cfb-9033-2dc51de29ddc|Don't you know I'm too powerful to kill?
7c1f8bca-9d18-4b1f-a288-5e801b432ff5|Give the bird a gun, then see what happens.
156c21eb-0ab1-434f-8e1b-6ba77f063b15|Yeah, I'm sure, I can handle any early birds.
29fa2c18-2883-4a32-b943-7f1cb4eaaf01|I've never held a baby bird.
25689c55-b68d-4792-990f-86a6c89a6752|Oh, I feel like a bird.
61fbf6b7-872b-4c01-b4d1-b7826c662c52|He doesn't like to be touched.
431fe941-9eaa-4bc8-9b78-50e00cab66aa|No, too many other people touch it.
92f9a670-9598-41af-b2b8-953330b38be1|I never touched your daughter.
ad4339d1-c57a-45a0-bc02-c9f878d2b53d|You told him not to touch my daughter.
e503ce23-18f7-4361-9d5b-7bbd6a4dbd16|I did it for a variety.
b70c6ef7-9865-4f62-9715-3389e2ec49d9|It's present in a variety of sea creatures.
0af52afa-5a68-4b2b-a4f9-d93abf15b7f1|We will have every variety of problem to study.
8e1fc143-c22b-474e-9a1e-ab9446b7a43c|It's just your garden variety abuse of power.
fa48d0bf-f323-4aea-8a8c-c5e7bd25c5d5|That wound is too deep.
c62e26e5-f476-426b-9d82-1c5874523d2c|Take a deep breath before you say anything.
3c8246f8-c003-4342-a6cf-1416f9ef61c5|We have no idea how deep the lake is.
ec69837b-9606-4870-9070-2df83012ac17|We've never had anyone this deep inside before.
12a91a2f-a5eb-46ea-a62f-9cc1b6031b74|And Lucy texts back as if it's you?
e674e5b1-3b69-4bf7-85b3-976ef7eb2102|I just read your text message!
9606793e-3a80-438a-b960-9fa462a1b473|She didn't answer my texts.
3902de07-1aec-4fad-aaf4-20e954654b0e|They have much wider roads.
d59a9a9f-3027-4213-8f86-8d10219ab0a3|They make your face look too wide.
e12b615d-8f03-4810-a90f-28bbfd89ed76|Your front door was wide open.
38140ab4-fe81-4b41-bb9e-4958abaeec4d|Maybe they got a name or a credit card.
de8658fd-5b08-496f-abb0-755807e9203d|But I can't take all the credit.
ac56baf6-8370-4f76-93ce-efe2228b3491|He said I needed a credit card.
b7d55d8d-7a02-4f10-b41e-2012b357b3b3|You should take some credit for who I've become.
163e5234-07ee-4153-9f00-1a7d1ba40ac9|He was nine, I think.
656f5a4e-a4e4-411a-9736-b3955ac5c71d|I had about nine of them.
5414790f-d582-44ba-a9e5-6aa2972f037b|You can quit after nine.
a2315e0e-15c6-4503-804c-1f9542a95032|Is that how many people there are, nine?
84aaf1bc-5cd0-46bf-b699-e34e3a793340|But you slept with him.
d258189d-b516-4832-ab69-122bf7d18186|Don't do it because he slept with me.
86785ef4-942a-42f3-a7ef-6e9c6efb7912|It's good that you are able to sleep.
16672e57-8546-4ab6-a720-a238f257aea8|I thought we were going to sleep in.
510e7c48-3118-462b-b142-6626d618e1d0|But Anthony's sleeping now, so I have to wait.
c2576a87-f25f-4fde-bb53-86f613c886c6|My only hope of finding my wife.
6d0d1a70-a886-4e92-871c-b1a64eab2e5b|It is our only hope if I fail.
6913b68a-609a-4e86-a221-e032aba8f665|Hope you enjoy the rest of the fire.
1cb19033-0263-4935-ae43-0dac2b1bd231|If you leave now, all hope is out.
a80e4225-0d74-4fc2-b984-8f49ba62ee93|Listen don't give up hope.
0fab9fbe-7837-4419-8bf2-e20476a90b21|Anyway, I don't care, announce me.
e37e80b5-a0c1-4611-a38b-fdd4e8a217cb|I'd be announcing myself as the killer.
7c780468-a09b-43ad-81bd-8740689ecac6|She's going to announce it in her speech.
5320930d-07d1-4739-a54a-c80c5be11352|But only yesterday, an old friend stopped by.
ef1bf2ee-c06c-486b-b174-11243141fd1e|Should I tell them you stopped by?
4e4f8d89-3193-4c13-b552-a3a85955a3ce|And suddenly this moment has passed us by.
dec3ddf3-1b3e-4960-b57b-6632c02af9b5|Actually, that's why I stopped by.
a5df65da-e536-47e8-b28f-dc7b821424ce|My mother just stopped by.
4a35723c-f7b1-4b49-8f4c-3fa21b3964cd|But they will fall completely different.
ce8b8024-e259-40ae-ab6a-0dd5fd18b567|My attention was completely focused on you.
1d9ded59-1b0c-4e78-8c91-75fed1cbb1e4|It's like you turned into this completely different person.
b1f778f3-785d-4368-bee9-7cf45978f28c|He completely lost interest in me.
f0bb3959-53ac-419e-acee-67fd6f77f886|I like to imagine stuff completely.
2b39f4e9-276f-4596-bf70-e61c47640d0d|Does it count now I've voted?
30b6f99a-1a2a-4755-a493-84b68ac7cfd5|Yeah, because we Can't vote for ourselves.
aaa3a874-d875-4585-8a7f-069f01308020|Well, personally, I'd vote for both.
9b3cb9b8-5059-429f-8363-ddc93a4f85e5|I can't believe I voted for that guy.
31dd5b8a-56d5-4915-993b-db90b64234bc|It's like you could conduct from this score.
eb640492-4953-42c8-a099-0de00f7e52ce|And it'll be me, conducting it all.
c5801003-5902-4290-8569-db70dcb6b3c5|We can conduct our own research.
1a1638d5-98b1-4356-b2a3-9e170640a819|I will conduct the actual talks.
75d77a71-c73b-44fe-92a7-503667d52f33|And what was the conflict about?
d6688ad5-8ac8-4665-ae8a-a8ba2bc0c8bd|Yeah, but there was kind of a scheduling conflict.
47b3a31c-f9e1-4a60-8b65-ff4ead7cc8fb|This is a clear conflict of interest.
753591de-4ae5-4c03-8d04-6e239739d758|Yes, especially if the conflict hasn't been resolved yet.
e37ec135-3888-4184-8416-4b71718ed1ba|The guy who replaced me wasn't happy.
d31865c7-c9b4-4428-a5da-cf6487f9e998|Three: We have you replaced.
51c308e4-4799-4ad1-b32e-d6b2e707a2cb|They're not quite so easily replaced.
0f498b78-bb31-4f40-8340-3958d26f5211|I feel like he's gonna replace them.
015ad59b-d8ca-4d23-abf0-a72754475743|Is there a unit available to attend?
91b54e38-d1ce-4f63-849a-ace18e41d2dc|Me, I have other matters to attend to.
015c1102-333c-47b3-88ba-cf05c340d9b5|A recording session I must attend.
8d970b41-49fc-4cee-89d8-26e63910e0dc|That was the argument he used.
5b392672-775c-4544-919a-04d7361f54d7|Ronnie and Paul got into a big argument.
ae169fdf-acec-4ec8-9d62-473dfc4e9988|And did you hear what the argument was about?
1f13d4cc-84db-445f-bef9-52d51d4311b6|Women are more than just sex objects.
468bf34a-108c-4fc7-bdd2-1a9dfae1d1c5|Santa can fly large objects through the air.
583dbec0-5e29-4a6f-887f-b4579ebe665d|Is there an object that can bring her back?
b79ea9a0-5717-4c1d-a934-6d5b279591ae|Oh, please, try the master key once again!
cf9257d1-8ea4-451c-ada7-d1f5267442a3|Oh, please stop giving him books.
a4c511a5-a530-4c97-b96e-95aef9211cff|Oh, please, may we come in?
2881f733-5080-4d54-a172-c920e0e8b3bf|They're building shelters because they're preparing for nuclear war.
a933a301-2cb3-468b-9833-615965365085|Nuclear power is just starting to take off.
39d3d288-8fe6-4ac7-9f11-d3273f62807e|Why have you got all these nuclear bombs?
504f335e-da17-47b2-b1d2-54f48731f65a|Which is why he sent this along.
f1c42aeb-c419-4e83-96e2-bcb3ebe6c298|Of course, we've known that all along.
4e7b9254-a835-47e3-a485-4e64c31537ff|Now, whatever I say, just play along.
be646fdf-53f1-4269-aabd-c41b32f5264d|There's no way we can ever get along.
98b07f04-22fa-44d0-9e65-e6b4172c85b3|Are you free tomorrow afternoon?
77e2998e-3094-49ab-b4aa-69625ff6a02b|Good afternoon, how are you?
a16afa64-13dc-472f-8f94-c781751585e3|My, you look like a picture this afternoon.
514fb5f3-9b21-43e0-b01d-094b0dcf783d|Let me pay you for your afternoon.
1ba26f5e-ddb2-4f1b-b59f-37de7a7f65a4|I can tell you where he'll be this afternoon.
24a3a13d-33c4-466f-b8c7-a42aa3566641|We've been over it a hundred times.
d73b9ddf-bc03-4582-b743-31f46cdd8f2a|No, but trust me, hundred.
ce98933b-9525-4a72-8833-09d872e293f4|I signed a hundred pieces of paper.
4e948f88-5c1f-4937-82c5-7c18da6d3f15|We can hardly fit a hundred people there.
96042095-2650-48c5-bb38-ecf85d8e9db9|What's that word where you encourage something to grow?
a43b450c-7209-4618-b596-7244cac87a4f|It would only encourage them.
7e541204-b907-45df-8fe3-378a64c997a3|It will only encourage him.
470af575-abb9-4987-9fef-d12ecb0396e2|I should have encouraged you to bring someone along.
a31348bf-55d1-4157-ba8f-efcefa11caad|You both are perfect for each other.
224ae6d6-6fa2-4843-adfc-6bc68e545182|Well, it's not perfect, but it'll do.
45ebbd39-124c-4391-908e-1d35deff78d4|Well in a perfect world, two days.
6b7434fd-d37d-43d0-a8c4-e431d0ae58c4|That part is perfect for him.
bfc6f1ba-9885-49c4-9b7a-77765f17d72e|It would be going, there's your turn.
556f3b9e-a06a-4570-bd05-847bf895be35|Things are gonna turn around, all right?
ad5d8de6-70de-447c-8f08-d241f5230d63|Turn right and keep going.
973ccb5c-e8a5-478f-baa5-f2b0e410885a|Let me have a turn, Face!
4add3a20-14b5-4b47-8d68-1c2ba7900892|Why can't he be British?
5fc76db2-aae0-4825-8ea0-90f76b56d3b4|I'm told that our shot at British ship.
eefd64c4-f99f-4500-bd54-bff8332195ad|They think killing a few British will solve everything.
6e996ac3-dc37-4d46-bfdb-e176ffa3b93e|The British army is the best in the world.
660e9b5e-4b36-4825-879f-7662b2e891bb|We'll take my car once they land.
943a557b-5652-4a85-b879-0b0b97f2243e|He's really interesting once you get to know him.
8d760fb5-1c1f-4c44-a4e0-2fa1346d9298|You'll feel better once we shoot some people.
13bb99bf-9181-47a9-8709-afd43702ff64|We'll know more once we get the results back.
ff71e053-fedd-4e9a-bbc0-25f931d5c071|How many kids have you examined so far?
f5027451-c2ff-4b57-bfe0-b64c4b001aa1|Let's talk to him and examine him.
8cc03a67-aa8e-4338-aa7b-6d2cb3dee29d|I don't need you to examine me.
803143a9-b9ec-4467-9e68-7b7982e01555|He's gonna be examining you.
5327a98a-5307-4ae4-b678-5a7e1876eb66|That is generally how these things work, yes.
ee63fc32-e3b3-4c30-9b56-abf30e3c8a10|I was using the term generally.
33cd3080-d88f-4f6e-9973-25cbc130837e|You know, just generally free, like, across the board.
77bd39bb-f6f7-4e59-80a1-a454838d9ce3|Yeah, generally that's what it means.
7c24bd64-f947-4ea8-b9af-2abd1e3b71d8|And I know her hours are generally pretty good.
e571fab9-4e2e-4f48-9aa4-bc7b95878f33|That right there is the beginning of true love.
aead769a-87a0-4e5c-96ea-99d8697f947f|Now, tell me everything from the beginning.
5f4c9217-a631-4d0c-aceb-f1bcd2675878|New beginnings for us, right?
3923b28b-742e-4642-9351-2d03ad97f514|The press secretary usually leads the kids in song.
de289462-8214-46a6-b42d-9f9471b16aec|I'll have my secretary call you.
eb3901b5-4451-4a92-9908-a4960eab120a|I don't think I said she was a secretary.
9a4e4f90-4336-4952-9be2-ce3c2f9f19cc|We should be at the beach.
84d4614e-6f9a-4c1f-b7ed-1c8cfbb6e754|Sometimes we were the only people on the beach.
28d46bcb-11df-4974-81ed-02e290799e4b|Should we kill them just to be safe?
0be83fb2-e046-426a-bad2-8f8da8bf639a|This safe, does it exist?
5b899c4d-7077-4a11-b8fc-3091422a1348|You need to be home, where you're safe.
99ff8a5f-ea6f-42c7-9aca-9f0e4e3f997f|I would've done anything to keep her safe.
1b240fab-de8d-4619-a4b3-c10b3a186346|I'm just glad that everyone is safe.
078eecb8-621c-496c-967f-693bc1ea00e6|How do you Like that, Spirits?
d9f9eb58-06ea-41fc-9492-29faab3e228a|Do not ask where the spirits they are not.
8bd54024-5077-4523-920e-646ac0a8fc3e|You're not in the spirit of this, are you?
29981806-9797-457b-bf32-0f187ccb90b3|I wasn't the one that found the spirit board.
ed2e6f42-e7e5-4e28-881d-8c6adf0f0b14|This is perfect for the weekend section.
c36acba7-76e5-4fe5-a663-cb280fb2bc1b|My weekend doesn't look so bad now.
b6682910-44e0-4052-b806-075a6a526061|Edward and I used to come here every weekend.
cb867065-8217-41fb-b581-f1915f1b678c|It's the weekend, I do not miss school.
0d2b816e-3d0e-4e57-87a8-0caf5330cfa0|You said just one date and this was it.
d4eebd7c-91ae-4e33-8d2f-6b79d3a9a728|Only I thought you had a date.
65e110a8-d5ed-4999-b0d9-f5283d6f62c7|Which brings us up to date.
2157fdb2-6c8a-4243-9237-cd78b3f2a215|Well, you made a date with him last night.
1559835b-e500-4c6d-8fe1-f6311c28a342|Well, what's the real dating world?
599c9656-9981-481a-9eb1-5cf3d9da355e|Or maybe I define myself by what I have.
7a5ee9c1-a7e2-406e-8d6e-91db6d136987|Your mother does not define you.
8ffcf111-b122-465f-a5de-0e0581799333|Owen, don't let her define you.
592dc7ce-804b-4912-a9a1-330d6303a09a|It's not our past that defines us.
b11a0558-ed83-41f8-bf0e-194a873f1fa0|I mean, how do I define myself?
93a4506e-032b-4d82-9dd9-6aef17061a2a|Andy will walk you through the features.
4fdde869-0221-47f7-b24c-1708fcdb5741|I care about special features.
535c34a9-27f2-4840-a6e2-2c877478b389|All the pool, bar, water features.
7d3b0363-6aa0-4b20-b424-71636cc985c3|It would end the global depression in a year.
765f837f-f19c-462f-a012-206f549477c5|Played out on a global scale.
34a5aaa3-c43d-4c52-99dd-735345aed280|I work for Global One.
5533a819-966a-4f36-92bf-c9058b5d4b5c|Our global must become local.
f442771c-c3fc-4a3e-a7c5-c93f91be84d4|No doubt about it, it's of global importance.
ce9e650b-d56e-4e3f-9e6e-62dcc016e82e|It is my very soul.
0f65737e-987d-42f1-9b6a-d2ef8a1c7c4a|And at the very end, there's a door.
2db28f70-8b5f-42b8-8be8-5d86dd0bf8bd|We don't need the element of surprise.
7666cb3a-831f-4fe2-8b39-93fcf85bfc65|But what if life exists based on another element?
b1e52964-0636-4343-b323-0132bb9c30db|We're the last element to roll through.
9e2f74f7-e581-45b8-955f-3eb5dba3119d|You were brought in to clean up this element.
60f61266-64b4-40bb-b0c4-56e697206880|And it's only our first attempt!
cfd60260-61ed-4690-b9f0-b6a591090800|The attempt on my father's life.
516b8399-2606-458a-bfbe-f6f24332067e|Was it an attempt on my life?
d0f370a8-a715-440b-a09f-b404de4437fd|Because every attempt we make, he beats us.
61ecbe2c-9f39-43a2-a39e-6ca5a78f94d9|For our next attempt, I wanna be the lead.
aa0a5eda-1279-4ef9-85bf-0525921935a4|Come up slowly with your hands raised.
97d0d4ad-d414-42b8-9869-b0060a3419ee|Get your hands up and turn slowly!
2c193415-ded2-415e-861b-8c8db8e0b6ef|This ain't no time to be speaking slowly!
b5aaeb99-16e4-46bb-af49-d0454654c676|Probably on his way to dinner with the governor.
8c0698a5-4ef8-4061-90c4-78625f339e38|Then find the governor, get it in his hand.
8e47b6b7-b98a-4a63-8380-3c8104d4a3ad|Just got off the phone with the governor.
23b2730a-c700-43a3-8341-159296ae893e|I'm not familiar with that concept.
8953104d-5c72-412b-a8c9-ddda475c6838|It's okay, it's a new concept for most people.
a7486fcc-0622-43c0-b488-b16c2337daa4|I mean, I knew that was, like, my concept.
aa2dba28-2daa-45e1-acef-d22f54b55a0a|I said those lies probably because I was sorry.
539850e6-1193-448c-9646-b666fea40b26|I'm so sorry I ever hurt you.
1f1baf56-da67-414a-accf-ba9fa91cbd04|I'm sorry I wasn't there to support.
01592b89-e6fc-42b8-a09e-bfc0cf490d5d|I'm sorry, I heard two people.
65f914fd-ad0d-441a-82bf-ec32557e53f8|He says he's sorry he's not in here.
1634a8ce-185c-4ed7-bbbc-c6a864ef8bd5|You won't get away so easily!
139f1b19-1ac6-46cc-b97e-96c481bd3dc4|Why did you give everything away so easily?
dcd85f6a-05ce-4eae-8899-cd0c5727e7a4|I could've easily said no to you.
dee45e34-1f5c-40c8-a53f-6e307cf989e9|You're giving up too easily.
cc39fa61-e309-4943-a92a-c88ee2e971c4|But, no, you don't get away that easily.
47b12562-4fc7-427f-b14d-9cd6645291c3|You can think of it as a battle almost.
a342fca0-9f3d-4722-b4f4-3b35047a3ef8|But I have to pick my battles.
ef088249-11ca-4335-82c0-e8e014e4e453|That seems a little out of his league.
ce075bd1-e0d0-46b3-9da7-a88c9deea69f|Nothing in your league, I don't suppose.
0ca1b926-32ef-4d88-908e-37cec6aa120f|You know, I've been in the league seven years.
e507a211-88a5-47cc-b951-5834dc661e48|She's way out of Henry's league.
d156e7b1-50a5-4633-b20b-011540c60f18|And this, bit out of your league, Jason.
9e8ac580-1c16-45b5-b05e-e30fe19fadb0|I have no one else in the camp.
ccb0f226-51f4-46cf-b4eb-ec248f91aa62|Kids who went to the camp said it's great.
26688337-b2b5-40c8-a187-8569c3650b0b|Are we really not gonna open camp over this?
360feab3-d77d-4070-8d73-86a0fee91063|And she's seen her parents' horses in this camp.
7ad149f0-b110-448b-a93e-50acc9e9359c|I haven't even introduced myself.
09496bdf-ed66-4ffc-b87d-a861f79add03|Maybe we can go around, introduce ourselves.
c9ddc8e3-93f9-48c6-a6a0-97411b5e3b55|I want a full status report when you're done.
137868a7-28e1-4e1e-a0ad-6c0285a7d80f|Calling, checking on the status of those crash victims.
d3c55cc9-154f-409c-b426-76c42e2a57d9|No photos and status only.
cc75cd24-e4df-4930-999f-eaf40f0c0da9|It is all about status in this world.
bb882826-c5e2-4c33-b5b4-1f9893e1d146|Insurance man come, bag of dollars, you go home.
df282f1d-99a9-4731-ae77-84a5563756b6|Without your insurance policy, they'll kill you anyway.
77e362ed-8e1b-49d6-84cf-810623845dc4|The insurance won't work, what do I do?
2fae8014-40ac-49d6-8816-256a7b95f867|Insurance, taxes, social security for three people?
00fa5cff-efc0-4dbe-a92a-8e8ebe24b46d|You told me your insurance was covering it.
9eac4665-86a4-4034-a9e3-9398130393bf|We must complete his work for him.
ceb227d2-6bd9-4009-b417-bfa6547287e1|And then our business will be completed.
9e39def8-42b1-44e5-9d8a-6f7d0fdaf176|I'd like them completed by the time I return.
c8da2651-7621-4660-8d5d-5696133f808c|We only have six months to complete your training.
de33380a-bb89-459c-9d95-d3fac6ca4310|Why can't we all just stick together?
827f2654-ce97-4e53-9f98-8d245f3d74f5|Are we stuck with each other?
110265ce-dc11-46db-a56a-4bf473013fcc|I'm afraid I'll get stuck.
c0d759dc-89c8-4c63-b602-927524fdc2bf|If only there was a solution.
56c6351f-b505-4f7a-a4a1-86d647f95d2c|And Eric is working on a solution.
f7603a0e-f472-4ead-89bd-433a466c23af|How will the solution I propose work?
17a5b4fc-6bd5-47f3-a2e0-92c124220edc|There is a solution to almost any problem.
f7268d41-926f-4616-80a7-5fe48c6ec185|The only solution is a tougher criminal code.
79e9dd4f-763e-411e-a627-d9b42a35b294|Can he swing, From a web?
98d2024b-52ec-45a2-ae09-ba9e9c9f75f2|Got his picture off their web site.
04d8f18b-5d38-4075-bdea-43ca77e8d8e4|A web of lies, none of which were true.
fa180c91-09c0-4933-8a1e-be4a1501b3d6|I work for web therapy.
fc8e6237-06e4-4efb-bbdf-c5a9888375e5|Look, you had a vision your first time.
f1bd914d-d276-4392-909a-9f3c942c9936|Your vision came back, didn't it?
60b3660d-777a-44b9-ade2-352d9cf23fff|You have night vision on this, right?
42f298ef-6f15-44b1-9fde-2fb7d9cb9ab7|You were having a vision, right?
02349616-a360-4d12-abad-1dc7149c0cfc|I told you, I have these visions.
c8905a10-6ec3-4d89-ad19-896e9ae1b07e|I hit him with a stone.
9b2f0502-7d9a-49a1-897a-0bb4b6d4735d|He threatens the stones, he dies among the stones.
970040f3-0696-4be0-b01b-4deeedf9ab78|You think there's more blood in that stone?
cf23cb5c-3b90-4107-9b40-3672c1b150e2|But I learned something interesting about the stone itself.
3216bdad-fc13-407a-86b5-da63d941d886|Right, but you don't lack anything.
47d60c50-9321-4dbe-8862-279b4538930b|Our lack of connection was, too.
a62b1457-745c-426d-adb1-1b2932500fc1|There is a lack of paper cups.
854adeb8-c273-47a7-8d70-e2192512ddbb|I don't drive, because you're on the driver's side.
4dbc0b8d-9988-4aeb-bad2-ca1c3e0ca143|I'll see where our driver is.
7c122579-c8fe-428f-872e-7bdd730ebb59|Everything's going to be back to normal real soon.
e9628bff-3df1-4030-b61b-7ee449c767da|He's a normal little boy, that's all.
d7c00c9f-7989-4eea-95c1-d1fca7f23dcb|Any normal guy would have paid up.
b506f540-ebd0-4562-a58e-4fb3005b5086|How're you gonna get to the truck?
a473aea8-c06e-4ca7-89e1-c2ab7d18e01e|Because we're really not in the truck right now.
b548a42f-7db3-4e28-a65f-bb7f4bfbf807|Well, that means I have a truck.
98fe4f3b-07de-4f59-9258-03bce0b740e0|And how should it be, minister?
c9984f47-8828-4ea4-8923-0c1ab997d0b0|That would be his minister.
ececc623-b56c-4df4-836b-c6748c549194|Surely you can speak to a minister about this.
5fec6623-e1ed-4515-a55c-43189e30e6f7|You can handle him better with me.
2dcb5936-3403-4dd3-b686-04892bdb6600|Oh, you mean handle it in person.
113c1add-4dda-420e-9fc4-d2eefab107f8|How would Ryan handle that?
8d3f97c7-0eb0-4c69-bf54-ca19ecc6a925|I didn't burn a hole through it.
b5db952d-6804-47c7-8f1a-2c162d9f402e|You front it so we can have a drink.
b92e70f4-3954-4bc5-b690-2dadbc02bae3|Well, that's interesting, because he's at the front door.
3f34ad29-e79a-4ade-b0d1-c25cb143dc48|And don't use the front door.
acefbb4c-cf1c-40c6-8dc6-008e9dd0a759|Shame we can't just walk in the front door.
6df56196-c47b-4ed2-ae33-516f43c134df|This time one made the front page.
6dbfaf64-04b9-4054-92b5-1509fb6769d2|I'm a huge fan of your radio show.
dec65df8-0938-4278-b139-8939265c8039|It doesn't seem to be a normal fan.
f48894ee-da6b-4582-82bb-23c8b2ff806f|I mean, I'm your biggest fan.
3f24cf3b-8368-4374-a228-bc48feccbab7|It sure is a beautiful little spot, Dylan.
0cf730fd-57cf-453c-9dc5-061a85338cc8|If you spot someone, tell me!
51e7928f-670d-4443-b8e5-76bc57f5cbc9|I'll save a spot for you.
87ac4f7e-65f6-410a-8c64-5039f586a001|I thought I'd be fired right on the spot.
b8878dec-3a87-4e26-8d0b-0fc19bbda53b|His crisis of faith came early.
2135464f-ca83-4a02-8d68-a52b37f39309|You work for the crisis line.
ee908063-ac88-4ef8-b4d0-3b71ea0f0263|If there's a crisis, you don't freeze.
c5fe944e-0ed7-4e39-b39d-3072c3bb59a3|No, I would be blamed for the economic crisis.
1517a1e3-1c1f-4546-9391-dd37f26afeef|No, no, no, no, you're not supposed to close.
14a63145-25cc-4b90-8b70-45e04d434d75|How am I supposed to run with someone else?
0f154d2b-cd4a-453c-b20d-d80fdf3b9c81|Yes, that's supposed to be me.
f7be8787-f9e3-47c1-b217-53263af3c6fa|You're supposed to be keeping her in line.
ae4f252d-2c13-4371-89c5-492f8f5fb0da|It exists but we refuse it.
995405bd-dd5f-4efc-bd29-3526798a1a16|I didn't let her refuse.
3dcdc57a-26e3-4c66-9cce-9e98f1650171|They tried to, but I refused to take it.
b9efbad0-c656-47f3-ac4b-72b795ea9974|Oh, come on, what can one little drink hurt?
31c29a94-492d-46da-96a9-8e6f220ddd7a|No, I saw what you just drank.
9487159c-d156-402d-8f85-28cd9a66f45a|Yeah, like you could make me drink that.
38c4623e-5ecf-43e4-b436-05b3b921f2d8|Can we get you something to eat or drink?
64cbd89c-86fc-4e9f-abf2-ae5d8c3bac2a|We have eight researchers working today.
4e5d3507-0431-4769-966a-20f1d7f497c7|This is the chart our researchers have drawn up.
da83baef-8f06-4057-b34b-45442dd5f7d2|I'm sure your researchers know all about it.
3cff80ca-e940-43f4-b6d6-9f8a383a9ee7|She is our very best researcher.
493fb5db-3546-4b7a-a698-8095e5988611|Some traditions are worth keeping.
c5b3ddbd-1ffa-4abc-8bdf-18da6f8efc96|No, I'm talking about our family traditions!
815ea2f5-7b80-475e-b227-2af59ca17a13|Well, I can't see him going the distance.
cece00bc-8ae3-4bd5-b076-88913a5c240d|First over short distances, then longer and longer.
91ab9bda-e4e2-48cc-a566-f68c39a5b671|They went to their ship to rest.
fa5941fc-c81c-489b-a03b-4bd28eefd290|Perhaps he's on another ship.
c7578180-b3bc-4ffc-b052-7f20e8de0e83|Something might be gaining on you.
22794b28-ace7-4ac2-aebf-c49ab01f5768|What do you gain by sleeping with me?
d10da352-7151-4be7-9da8-bbf308606dca|Nothing is gained by rushing.
355ea188-67c1-4718-94e4-a4dfe686c04d|I did it and I like to gain!
a2616de2-2d22-4f83-8478-e62fb7a614a9|I don't know how to express it.
6ecbbe27-6392-42a3-9a0d-ffd1667e99a6|Thank you for expressing that.
84aac96a-18b5-4da4-ab46-906a370091f0|It's like words really cannot express.
931bafe1-9fd4-4dc6-8847-35230b791dd7|You have no trouble expressing any negative emotion.
b74a11a4-4ee9-4817-83d6-73c3dde7b95a|That's the girl that was put on ice.
053564ec-24ad-45d4-8cbd-2b9c994a03c2|Then you put him on ice for two days.
b0e1d45a-5bc4-495e-9fc0-0a295725d629|Well, the ice hasn't touched her heart yet.
6a97a81b-a52e-4ae6-ba5d-d2705d8dce44|Didn't you say you wanted ice cream?
b44a2635-8970-4c00-bfe0-6c2b7a09e022|These incidents have grown much larger in scale.
152d011f-6ec0-4b93-96a8-94a9be7ba14d|For some reason, he trusted me with the scales.
d5c4131e-3c02-4c82-be4b-e3045b54c922|For every man, there is a scale.
b7f4f85e-6d83-4f6d-8ef1-09b103cfc20b|Can you get on the scale for me?
9dd0eebc-d3ce-4c8e-aa49-c415334b7ff6|They have scales and stuff.
670e8e53-1d6f-4be4-92f8-3f0f89bab80d|Except for the part that isn't brain.
e0e799aa-f8c5-43c7-b861-15c56a5dfc83|Do I have brains in my head?
170a059a-7527-4750-b16d-1b5505268119|But he had a lot of brain power.
a5b4dae3-cb0a-4959-9bd7-b70484344072|No one could survive losing this much brain matter.
01687c1d-2b44-45e5-85ae-29a99aefc892|I looked for love in summer and in winter.
3dec253e-f92b-4981-8bf0-59f6ad5e7358|How'd you like to partner up for the winter?
5e2ad10f-e140-4454-b98c-1924f32b4544|I'm moving to America in the winter.
3f33e042-ef83-41df-be13-372c57bb721c|Like, do you survive the winter?
3ff77c07-7523-46ff-970b-b74c351240e3|I'm clearing things for the winter.
8847ced0-916f-4403-9409-97a10b54a956|I accept many commissions, I finish few.
66d47694-3801-48a4-b436-456b4e861a0f|We work on commission here.
12efe57d-87cf-442f-85f0-59d750883a33|Sales meeting, and we make commissions.
f6a6b004-7fa2-4daf-ad5f-1fbf636f0da7|Where can we find food here in the woods?
c1fb04d1-3c0e-4ae2-891f-2a83efebc32a|Thursday, I was back in the woods.
2f84771b-7f88-45d4-ad19-3376b89a9e7e|And made their way into the woods.
efac8cbe-207b-4320-8eae-38688ec84a51|So, do you have wood in Los Angeles?
b0063aee-596a-4569-9c79-540d6caf2ec5|And I shouldn't want an increase in salary.
70166105-426a-43ed-8a66-9445bcf64d05|But I'm afraid there's been a price increase.
290ab90d-3969-4067-a9f4-459c9a982dd1|And you support that increase in the asking price.
5819cbc9-95e5-4100-ad82-cc5185a14228|Return it to me when you have his name.
b83439ea-35cc-48c2-b987-76818d2ff138|Did you get my return ticket and papers?
a953aee9-2a89-48d1-95fa-c386a372bb84|Ask her what she's getting in return.
95adc676-0008-4648-b5e0-cd2d0e6a4f05|But they never invited her in return.
254756fc-074c-4e3d-98a2-f5daf7c2ca31|And the really deep ones return again and again.
e367516e-7c98-4e75-9d17-389c2107a347|I know more about division than you'll ever know!
ca73fc46-81c6-4d07-8464-bc5533c91783|Can't we send people from other divisions?
ea2bfc26-26cc-4baa-8974-42bbf38866d0|Do you even know what division he's in?
985fdccf-798e-4f6e-9f13-60ba31698a09|Your father wants you to run the whole division.
74bbe22f-990c-45c4-855e-4d5073185251|I knew our species couldn't exist together.
ff08e9c7-3038-446b-9e1f-6018b4e4b16b|I am not familiar with that species.
7dc332ad-b8ff-456e-9b14-e66d0e1eb26f|He's a different species than a young lady.
9bb527f1-8440-47ce-9f3e-6776b94b60b0|You need to figure out which species you are.
282768e9-2f9f-4f5d-8f55-1368cd092303|You cannot roll six eyes?
87cd3bbc-e274-41e6-acc2-d31b989afe00|Some car rolled up on me.
2bd64f87-9b9b-4586-819d-bc2425630719|Max, Frankie is rolling on Molly.
e6098bc8-6a96-4e7b-baf0-71d358b627e2|Oh, we can always roll the windows down.
4a6da3e9-962e-4ba7-ae4e-79e714d05f2c|It just rolls off her back.
5c991098-8d91-462d-8a4a-0a51e3bcfb30|And yet the ground opens up to hide us.
c7071fc9-948d-4c3e-952d-325d6cd5cdbd|You don't hide that from me.
0e6be472-4738-4a20-b81d-5820b3aee9ab|He thinks you're hiding someone.
f982dcc7-bcb8-4c59-a57d-02427469fdc2|What do you have to hide?
15b82603-2191-44b8-9f2e-713403f81066|Where were you in the middle of the night?
493c3758-e1fb-4a14-9a7b-052809abb7f3|We're right in the middle of something very important.
13253351-c4da-4d21-87ad-76173d7c4f22|Your client's product killed this man's wife.
57264748-3337-4c49-9205-0df985281f43|This is a case with a real client.
ed804ed0-ad05-42c1-8038-5a8dd420cb74|Is that why you never stay with your clients?
9ffffbf3-7f11-4cf5-ae35-aae025b28050|You were talking way over those residents' heads.
19a6147e-5cca-44b6-8212-f81a4f502210|You're the resident manager, you call.
50aede12-aa15-47f8-b54a-06d1bb689a0b|No, I'm- - I'm the resident on the case.
b1ec7ca1-8967-4fc4-9c8a-8881086b9bdb|Back to being a legal resident around here, Steve?
23dc896d-26e2-46ef-af89-29a941c50859|My lawyer sent over our business contract.
79192dd7-c7ee-4a51-beaa-18519ef38633|The contract between myself and this family?
0511c4b4-e47b-475c-a372-6f462e720c2b|You just need to sign your new contract.
d045ba5d-6784-46de-8c19-b8302bc1e526|Think I get this Gold Fish thing now.
ee0c7f3d-c50f-4b1e-980d-14559498d33f|You won't get any gold from me.
ddd633bf-36ec-4525-97e4-c731f2896fe7|Gold is still going up.
0787cbfd-f6e3-4829-b2ac-471b85b833c3|We have more than enough gold left.
5fd4ca75-5e2f-4fab-9df7-8b7f980fbc23|Don't tell me the future's riding on it.
bed9ee0c-8ce7-49ed-9d80-b72bf46193c0|Did you meet your future second wife?
8935954e-a118-40e1-809d-2858831e4b44|Well, just keep that list for future reference then.
030cba2f-513f-439e-bc78-d97c0394b360|Who is this potential client?
5ece13b5-2085-41ec-bf52-534ceb5bccfd|Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
8994a928-2c20-4549-8e3b-8a879e647907|You said I had potential!
4faa3e7c-b403-4809-acf4-6d79b7ca87ef|I don't feel their presence at all.
f7395e7a-262f-42b0-9691-baee6bc98ecb|Don't question my client outside my presence.
93264911-28db-4f61-be1c-47fd2aebeb86|We have to make our presence felt.
a4a63ed4-382a-44b6-90cf-905484790f53|Did he come to the institute every day?
c69f17b9-92c4-417a-a279-1f60bd09652f|And what about your institute?
014cf40a-e439-40a8-93dc-ab5f8d7acefa|Why don't you come visit the institute?
604f9207-ff68-4b53-8a88-094b1de218b6|You're not going anywhere near that institute.
50acf301-d4d9-438f-a757-7db37b5bb67f|You'd better see the screen, sir.
9c01cacc-6565-41f5-b9db-9c1eaa6c1a7f|Arthur's asking to see you two at the screens.
d3723242-851c-4efe-9afe-940eee0ef8aa|Oh, that's half the fun of this run.
56f87941-35d4-4c13-81d0-5de767bc92e4|I will send somebody on a coffee run.
25339503-5471-449a-9f16-fe40bcd30742|They broke out and made a run for it.
075faa7c-10a2-4ae2-baef-1ad5d9b32772|No, I just went for a run.
aa5fcf20-a648-4cf5-9fd5-55777af39645|A Chinese guy came in here earlier.
78e2218f-97de-4415-828a-f56cbe9e26a3|And I was hoping you were my Chinese food.
59a32a02-a4a4-4f7d-a973-07a4a742fa3e|Tell him to step away from the horses.
f2bf2d5a-2754-4a8e-bda2-ffc8470bac85|Bob is my horse, and I love Bob!
19bd078b-d702-4e5d-8e43-14947907131e|You see that my horses have stopped.
67db2e78-c5d3-4b8f-9e0d-333e1cc1911a|We're supposed to bet on a horse.
bf6ddbd5-d5f1-4bf1-a776-ce4c2e6a7310|And so do horses, of course.
a9cf2188-a560-4734-8315-c30d76dea86c|Here we go, some European money.
7eadf229-2bb2-48fd-8cf6-c958f68b835b|European men like yourself sometimes carry one.
5481ef37-5b84-4265-add4-cf1004ca8908|European countries will overcome their borders and grow together.
605c07b7-7679-4019-b858-35d6596f0fbe|You have very European tastes, Danny.
6e1a5b77-fca0-4461-8c47-d3bfb4a3de64|All true, but I'm probably not your best target.
55f1cc5a-a07d-4c1e-bfe9-76978a1d8faa|What, you think you're the target?
57f51292-b710-4247-9dc9-8ccfe9013b4c|Looking for targets, I guess.
949ac44e-c82d-4a45-942b-34eb13f904bc|Weapons should reach their targets in four minutes.
bb3e3be6-ca0a-4bf2-9b2b-286df1d73a43|You just have to be willing to see it.
7d3fa9d3-2f2b-4ae7-8a69-2033934e605d|That's a risk we were willing to take.
08ecbd79-8d9d-4247-b1b3-2351d637e183|The good news is, I'm willing to help you.
80be0121-aae9-4b0d-a0cc-3263fc119578|I've completed my survey, sir.
7b83fb46-ffa8-420e-945e-8773cd21460a|Okay, I took this music survey class last year.
eebbd19e-9900-4ac0-8fe9-e24f92c2b8d1|I didn't know you were interested in dating.
d9ec25a5-6571-427b-8401-f051cb989913|I think he's interested in her son.
79c4fd07-6074-4860-8c48-7702e8cb42b0|I thought you weren't interested.
64de23d7-6649-48a9-8f6e-1e35f7be8e35|It was the words as words that interested me.
23e20b94-158e-416b-bcb5-fe8e28bbc135|You're not interested in anything real.
c94bd999-252a-43c5-af21-c8c6192d7ed6|We are not interested in your proposal.
ace593b1-f018-4c4b-a3fb-7f973b45ec1e|You two kids were never interested in the business.
e38e15f4-0e4a-4965-bb88-dc157c62a860|We're just interested in the feet.
6c7868f2-59c8-46a3-a8d6-a14da3876a40|It's not like I'm actually interested in him.
09020511-3370-4e11-a365-0ac1ed341844|There's someone interested in your problems.
278e24da-623c-4a18-b03e-ac39a393d97a|Got a bit of bad news, chief.
f3da7c9e-64ab-4cfa-9fbc-a1f861178b5a|Let's get this guy in front of a crowd!
1eb00381-56c6-4d6f-aa73-976d8712171b|I think you were the in crowd.
4455270a-0cc8-4aaf-a5a1-beb11599fe61|But for this man, I'd have gone to prison.
54ac83dc-d063-49d5-9f3b-833e44b0fbd5|You were up at the prison today?
0e83cf3f-2292-44ec-b5e6-248b4ef572a2|He wants me to visit him in prison.
9ccde87a-1b3d-42b8-bb10-0c5373848b9e|So easy it landed you in prison.
8c17c223-fe07-4286-9901-8b08ee959ef1|They'll have me back in prison for this.
76948815-08a5-4abf-b42f-17028367245f|He's just obviously more than that.
4c051c08-17fe-4db2-a9f8-52ccb7203d3d|I've never gone down on a guy, obviously.
28f9b304-6edf-4842-880d-c5ca1c804745|But you're obviously very smart.
4ec829dc-c87a-4609-a1ea-4a5866ecf281|Are you on a first name basis already?
1326f079-8ceb-4ef9-a5a2-c6e6a39acd30|Don't pretend it has any basis in science.
8d2db234-2865-4ac5-9e95-c43382e1107d|All right, on a trial basis.
f6c2b281-b627-43db-8eb5-2500a462d200|I like to cover all my bases.
efcadc74-74d2-4373-8815-7368f65e538f|She's not at her apartment, her cell's off.
5b93cfb2-7ebd-44bd-9306-bd227f0a7284|They found her in her apartment.
c996ff74-ab46-4fc5-b45d-1fd13068e99a|He's still sitting around the apartment.
3761d4bc-df35-4e13-b7b7-dd2eedce8923|He went into your apartment?
bde4dc48-809b-4001-90df-d96885b89bca|Was this your first time at the farm?
d5700b56-ad39-426e-93dd-f603146415a5|I mean like a farm animal.
867eac9c-a301-4fb2-b2f8-dade9334e7bd|I trained at the farm too.
e7a41a72-0e16-48f2-b603-bc09071b995a|My dad used to work on a farm.
f69fef88-55d5-406e-bb18-df469b3c6a8e|Joey, your flight was all right?
f76196fb-ab34-41be-88cd-455804d94e6a|We're on the next flight out.
f2bf10cd-27dc-40b1-82bf-bce93087d9ee|I'll be on next week's flight.
3dff8d79-070d-40c6-841c-f581e105ebd4|She was gonna get a ticket on another flight.
ff053aba-0895-47a2-9960-0a0d4da1f8aa|Did they make their flight?
af4330f3-b40c-4260-a5df-8c4c43452c34|Something's taking shape there, but it's not clear yet.
98635f37-c924-4fc9-9480-33acde33ae41|So, are you in shape?
549520f6-f5de-40df-a5d9-36e4429fb2fb|But he was in kind of bad shape, too.
60d80a02-0af9-4fa2-9930-956e3781e2c6|But you know what the demands are gonna be.
0b8cfdf0-27cf-4a71-a9c3-2db07bf026f0|I'm sure you're very much in demand.
c2eef2fe-9c83-4307-929e-65b14fb2c0b9|Is there anything else you're gonna demand?
4d0e6158-c964-4480-8e11-7ddf7b5f9481|Maybe your family's demands should come first.
4e8addbd-91ef-4cdb-add0-8df064c9f7dd|Let them go, with all your strength!
ec01bc9b-b25b-4e92-bd8b-d8ee361be051|Trying out your new strength, I see.
d7c30da0-774a-4ade-875c-54247c77fee0|She had strength, like you.
c9c1b186-b1d9-4bf7-93be-6486de25eac2|The sick one is in the village.
8549b22a-7b9c-4f2a-8024-b04df52a6cf4|Two more villages have fallen.
a7c8ed6a-4ed9-413d-805c-ccc57f771bf9|He must see to his village.
6d5e3a67-d231-40e8-b99a-f20f62603277|They don't even leave their villages.
35bb2d4a-ba38-49d8-b2db-df206bae552f|You're not even operating this, are you?
2e527b0c-855f-4b82-a128-b703c1177548|But it's not the way I like to operate.
114f52c2-206f-472e-991f-778e0cc12062|He's the doctor who operated on Martin.
37f60235-c774-43b8-a912-8b1321fa3d44|He's being operated on, it's all I know.
fc1f029a-e0fc-4e6f-a03e-d249d8669dfb|Gwen, Owen needs to operate now.
4ae39ebb-a864-45f0-8aae-6e3026c8e69d|Do whatever you and the reporters want.
75573833-83bc-4769-b8d5-23034f975cec|Why'd they try to blow up the reporter?
6329e624-a14e-47c7-a0be-3eb2eef9bf72|She doesn't have enough shares to stop us.
e925b527-bfba-4577-a799-9401326f8f2a|I've had my share of adventures.
27c97b39-175d-4d2f-81dd-abd4d1d85a5e|He'll be under guard at all times.
00b2d605-61cc-4fa5-a716-df4c784451e6|Now call off your guards.
2dc7e59d-7bec-41f4-80a2-0f674e81dc02|The guard got himself killed over this?
11e7720f-714c-408e-8e59-e3c846a0c125|Now all will be its guard.
e399588c-b861-4c41-9219-107d3a6410ec|You kept her close and observed her.
33f6df4a-dba5-4989-89e0-a96194bac22d|Thank you for allowing us to observe.
6224772d-c7aa-40aa-9dd0-3ea6b69f2630|I've delivered things to your home.
6165c4d9-32bc-4e20-bef2-194d10473ea2|Look what fate has delivered up this time.
df32e0dc-6236-4909-8438-7f093345e625|You know I can't deliver that.
60336843-f33d-4f62-bb03-d3fbdc4674c3|Can't be, you're counting wrong.
a7c7b1b3-9c6b-4427-8001-29ad64bd4243|We can count on you, right?
3abd1fda-24e7-4434-914b-50a115cdd16e|That's what we were counting on.
1d3518ef-dc34-470b-98c6-741e37e4545e|They haven't counted us out yet.
0f79f825-3266-49e5-a581-c80f5a8f0731|Do you need something from inside?
3e729c42-a33e-4de9-8016-11365bad0791|We can find what we need inside.
c3ae726a-3d6b-449c-9924-2d6d69b6dc13|The only problem is, how do we get inside?
382777b5-3526-4838-a2ba-4a030a8cd7fd|You know, I just feel, like, really good inside.
d0420011-0c5b-438f-8ebe-0c60ea53a5bf|Maybe you shouldn't be flying it inside.
664f7c3a-6102-4380-b6f6-025d51f39888|Let's use that to our advantage.
fb2dd21c-bb8e-49b4-acca-9125b46a0ab1|I trust you both and you just take advantage!
d265abc3-f324-4721-8ca5-79f06b2ca51c|So that they won't have any advantage.
5b147837-a81b-49ec-a336-dc15de7721c7|Oh, yeah, we went way out and wild.
1ee8c187-c153-435a-af0e-ea5f5b621e1c|They Live like wild animals.
6a56e145-d0b4-4ceb-85ff-d61953004465|But this has succeeded beyond my wildest dreams.
59338463-6392-424b-89dc-e5a7dca03305|He was angry and wild!
99efd3e4-312a-448e-9788-ba13797df3f6|What about her previous jobs?
3f6faa1e-12a1-4f6f-85b7-6858692689f7|We were good friends in your previous life.
d86dfb67-6797-4b24-963d-86738a6da803|That you wouldn't expose her previous profession.
21a4e520-15e9-4e81-96d8-bd2e1462a651|I need to look at your previous tests.
d72f42d7-6e8f-4212-956b-8b4a4ee8de63|And during about nine years' previous cases.
521004d5-d2ca-448d-a45b-239d5f0461e5|Fly each leg five more times and average them.
99a8575d-82d2-45f0-9029-416ab57becea|Average night, average neighborhood, average murder.
83bdfef1-9a53-4202-8035-d21a9c0a6feb|Now you're totally average, like the rest of us.
01add455-d570-4da6-8f92-c4a0d638d780|The truth about our abilities always emerges one day.
00a970f7-1851-44df-b020-7b9346a253f9|We're looking at emerging markets.
3e9cf0b8-c789-4604-b730-01d494e207dd|We wanted to invest in an emerging market.
89552292-bb06-4a96-94ea-97c4b9ed5442|Are you ready to emerging towards the island?
9db289da-4342-40fe-a30e-fbc1112788d1|I'm sorry, do you have something to contribute?
3b367266-019b-42b5-87e2-3a2331076289|I'm trying to contribute the best way I can.
71ab89ce-f617-4d1a-a54d-77291d1eac83|Well, then I question your leadership.
1e9b96e5-1269-4032-b0f8-08b193557fe1|I can provide that leadership.
ed25ec2b-e00b-449b-8754-c90dd3d902be|But that is the price of leadership.
c6d228e9-ab61-4785-9aac-07d3d73d1f9f|You've never understood the burden of leadership.
00a589a6-179d-4b4e-8fc0-f05c3394f443|No, what's this boat doing?
06a43908-7001-410f-93e0-22a522fb692c|I'll find my own boat.
3235b91b-e1eb-4939-98b0-bde3a9ac39ca|How do we get them off the boat?
b16a4e55-c93c-4f09-8513-ce5cb0d4dbf7|So, that puts us in the same boat?
adad2b5a-0a6a-4dc7-8e9d-4553f308a54e|I'm in charge of this facility.
73432b63-10ce-4841-aae9-7e781f35f39e|Been to their facilities in Virginia.
c8a5cd28-a70f-45bf-a519-febaf245f868|And second, we're a private facility.
1e1d1752-f66a-4830-b4e8-76c375cacd3c|No one leaves or enters the facility.
402799f0-682a-4abf-8141-3a1de4d758c5|Here look, I got you a present.
8e68fa02-d1a5-4fa0-8b99-5446aa5f967a|And we do have one more present.
8330a4b1-5829-466b-bf4a-61609f018068|Here is a present for you too, Eva.
ec3350ab-b162-41ce-af23-d9ba9148e659|Andy is now opening his first present.
5a1514af-b593-4dcd-af59-13ab5db846a8|I've always earned my living.
6bb926df-5a9c-4735-becb-c8696f932ee7|No, but then she earned it.
9a3e7e34-b074-4ffc-b8d5-0b6ee9ec0ead|I couldn't earn enough in a year.
4c931ee6-0d73-46fd-82b1-9f3462df07ec|Oh, go ahead, you've earned it.
df90ed9b-e525-4102-945c-ae16d88bd6d9|He speaks so highly of everyone he works with.
dbcd910b-4727-49fe-a89f-3b92611c30d3|This is highly trained police work.
875c6c97-4f69-466e-af08-bb9b4aaacc4d|They must have thought very highly of you.
a80c28ac-343f-43e1-82f3-ccb46d08fe40|She always spoke so highly of you.
d2249913-761c-4444-9025-4ca0311c7d1a|This is a highly sensitive matter.
72ffe6b6-2fd8-4dfb-8354-c8fd2e0bf5f5|You drive both vehicles out here by yourself?
d2fbf996-e7d1-40ac-80a3-ff719e8497b6|And did you look inside the vehicle?
1c6119b6-d9b0-4a8f-ae18-3dcdca8a5efc|All told, I'd say at least three pounds.
683849e2-ffa6-415f-801e-999366b45344|You and Teddy ate pound cake together.
4075a052-a80e-4463-b73d-f22ad10b6a95|But real sea horses are tiny, my love.
e84cc1fd-b9f7-4614-802f-a07b8e9e4bc5|You cook in that tiny studio?
9ba1d2f3-e3bc-462a-8c6d-2130eed7b6ff|Well, as you can see, they're very tiny.
a0decf94-87b4-4661-b1c8-6d38f17171f7|Let's get back in there and settle this!
4a3eec84-6734-49e1-a306-5e69a303213d|Well, that settles that, then, doesn't it?
8158048a-0792-4120-a696-4d10dc732d18|True that she can settle for one third?
31f955d1-269e-4487-8436-72c1897c68f3|I will consider this matter settled.
6c794604-ae76-4719-ae89-2abc4bed795c|It's settled: we'll stay here.
cfc4c910-ba25-40d6-b379-794ab6ea2066|Unless you want to go for two.
942c66fe-ed1f-44bc-a9bd-1e8c7fef02b4|I won't unless you promise me.
0e9513ad-9f90-481e-8ce1-79e0884fd498|Unless she wanted it to appear that way.
6a44433b-e070-4c4e-894d-51ee388c09f6|Unless he thought I killed his uncle.
3e0f695b-184b-43f0-a0af-9579dedc55fd|Would you like to come to my place tomorrow.
868361eb-b28c-4101-aa5c-8e7636fba6c0|Tomorrow I'll do whatever you want.
069ed0c7-7085-48f3-b7e8-c09688501805|No, just tonight and tomorrow.
b60eefa7-7e02-41e6-b2ac-cd03fca66966|I guess I'll hear for myself, tomorrow night.
8a614c46-85ef-4bc5-afd3-dc5550691098|We should hear back tomorrow.
e67bbe89-e0ed-431d-b4a8-17d0314a0d5f|Back to the hotel, as quick as you can.
bdaf0188-6f6e-4381-8374-97389bd35a1b|This way you can reach for it quick.
3a5d6666-a51d-440a-b565-df09d6bfe3e9|All right, but be quick.
dfd4824b-dcf6-4156-92df-6056f42ca176|Doesn't matter, I'll be quick.
d8f7bbeb-1cb0-47c2-8666-f6c1783ffc4c|If you make it quick.
1c398a7f-9339-4e49-9900-925013ce2f48|That's four blocks away from where Peter was killed.
481e3abb-6488-422b-8ec7-a533c55b9fc4|Four blocks from the crime scene.
9defcae4-24ee-47e5-92e9-1ad24c1c2c50|Back in the block, come on.
ef506654-fca4-43af-a293-fa38404af979|I'll tell you in a block or two.
d2b6e2b9-1956-4c45-8c0f-b0482e7e53c5|That's why I'm so light on my feet.
c7a7eb69-9b59-4533-96a4-ee0eb89a419a|Now, it's gonna be light in two hours.
1e2089f6-f493-4972-84c9-5712ef94d04d|I'll let my readers decide.
d485513c-d249-4305-ab02-4d7a3a37a2a1|Even the best face reader can't read my face.
f7d61450-8b22-4abc-a296-20c2f1d5dc63|What am I supposed to be, a mind reader?
90d83fbd-a089-4d17-acbd-3d147f5d1e4d|It's been such a bear collecting from people.
38e3d23c-418a-4c6f-bd64-cf42cb07feb5|Yes, he says he'll come to collect later today.
b0985bf0-637e-4520-9f1c-050e618ccb85|Anna said it was my job to collect them.
572252e3-9514-41f6-88e5-d17153c963da|Then why didn't I collect?
dafde638-d3f3-45e6-b6de-f3560f381331|If we've got guests, where are they?
c8b82a44-6893-4247-9473-ddba52fd4645|Come here, you have guests!
643726fb-1a67-4521-9299-68f7fad0fe6a|I'm just here as a guest.
eb5fec88-a4fd-47c8-acd7-39a78c9d896a|I'm sorry, we have no guests under that name.
13f019bc-3504-40d9-af47-6beefa4579b9|We can't pay our guests.
ddf7eacb-dee6-4239-bd56-62c680cdf8ac|I'll go and listen from the living room.
cd13e3c1-9216-4447-9e68-6557f2380fbf|This is my living room.
3312d2cc-edf3-4673-88b2-25d278b474e1|To what they do for a living.
c5f9d2de-01e7-4ddc-9a6a-9253aaf61138|I trying to make a living, do my job.
c7a9263c-ea8d-45cd-a168-453141d4e170|The tools, the sand channels, and what have you.
14c6e684-b2af-4feb-a1f0-e9d410353443|Well, we got the tools, we got the talent.
c2691310-1a9e-4af8-be26-6fa2a7ae9b5b|But the tools aren't coming until morning.
01682c29-a154-4230-8350-8b8aa5ebb488|We'll just use our special cake tools.
eda6eb53-bf85-4363-9912-4598bf7cba40|Then you can stay here under protection.
e3da4d17-2f2c-4ed6-87f9-116e4970cdc3|It's time the law offered these victims some protection.
57077286-d303-4eef-b6bc-6e535822e214|You at the victim without protection.
76940a57-043a-40f1-9d6d-2e4c1f5f3d2e|Would you go alone in the train without protection?
a2bd7bbf-fa7b-4373-ad78-1f535096a30b|You've got to be fair to her.
5b3db47d-f041-40a3-868b-f29af7ac8f8b|Nothing that's happened to you has been fair.
9254e4f9-407b-4245-b025-7fff5d7b17f1|Yeah, I got a pretty fair idea, Rebecca.
d473e1e9-8d46-40c2-8b96-c44981f10637|We must show her by becoming fair.
d8a4329a-1926-4826-9e49-53b2032bf1ab|And what if I need additional support?
3e52b2ac-0c3e-45c9-9469-9e56e891f1d5|I'd like to order some additional tests.
02413429-c051-4cc8-8c2c-4ebd84c15f95|Shouldn't we promote one of our own?
0f179ba6-5979-471a-91fd-e149692e5409|I was promoted to that a year ago.
705c46bf-1d6c-4653-9a92-1514c534c52d|No, that's not a mistake, you have been promoted.
3b9f0616-f496-4d5f-bc5e-d4dbae02a62d|We deal in office equipment.
338ae494-6b32-43fa-a807-a1bc6da8b522|The equipment looks like it's been used recently.
a7b260f2-a5dd-4378-ab51-03e6467f639a|But mostly it's a business trip.
759dd67b-90de-48aa-948e-75bd9754a2bf|Mostly we just make it up as we go.
0d39f79a-9462-4e26-8ab6-98a064703e0a|And they all seem mostly normal.
9aff9a78-15be-4f8d-8182-c8d9af0961ca|It was mostly him, really.
f86fd23c-774c-4c73-b553-9c5272310db7|What do you want so I can order?
4bc6a132-4fe1-4ce9-aa55-d041442b4a38|I didn't order you or anybody.
2e0fa03f-7c8b-40c4-a34f-b1e2196a463c|You cannot order me to do anything.
3fe76efa-0719-4ba8-a18b-f9fb4821e186|And I order you to let me in.
7017a9a3-b33c-4183-8c83-947feca9725a|Okay, so maybe Sam ordered another attack on himself.
4a6cbc7c-f110-4056-bad5-51ebf827e679|I think of it just as, like, a painting.
09472f66-8ebb-4a38-bd4a-8904a9bcd86e|I say that guy was painting without his glasses.
25763522-56b9-4713-85f7-eaaf5b238b1e|I'll have that painting in a couple of days.
1ca81d21-db28-4cd2-8c32-06151fc68c53|Return the painting before I kill you.
170a4a15-6593-426a-93d1-d41802c4eca9|Remember your house painting partner?
2439e476-50a5-470f-a40e-25719c1529e7|Well, it's got to be better than painting houses.
5d95641d-5d83-43c4-8d0e-6663b154a32b|But you're not painting this one, no.
bef1ce55-b11c-4bf7-8259-cdf21a28b083|Well, nobody ever went to prison painting a house.
4d8c4498-09ac-412e-b51c-42e516d71024|What room will I be painting in next year?
217e133e-64de-4932-b335-b32c7e3aa206|He's been feeding her all these lies.
33cb3579-d37d-40e8-9417-e4f75972c8af|We could be feeding it what it wants.
9cfcc111-9e52-4854-afca-027c5cf6cf8b|I'm getting so fed up with this.
a962188a-d51c-4087-ae5d-fcb1d773f32b|You feed it with your own hand.
2ad22651-86af-4c3f-a66e-0985582e3934|There's a deeper principle involved here, Alan.
0758c7b5-b3eb-4743-9b48-c05235fec350|They only stay beautiful in their bowl.
e48aa613-7d13-48c7-a0f8-d51ea8ae3128|The stuff in the bowl, what is that?
51dc1831-a756-4733-ba47-a1985af2701e|Guys put their key cards in the bowl.
088f1952-a0fe-46d7-afbd-f30d2575336c|Now, that bowl cut is a crime against hair.
184cdaa6-2734-4160-9c29-f9fe21806b93|Bet they look like bowls of milk.
1ec36afb-e14a-4fdd-b4cc-a52ab0205aa1|Just don't lose this claim ticket.
c05d3386-555d-47fa-98c0-69ffd431f0ef|After all, you do claim to know the future.
b56a8743-5a65-4c2c-ab34-14f5014b2b4a|And if I shall stake my claim to England.
4aa7341f-61e6-4364-b26b-785345b3dc6d|I can't find any insurance claims.
b4aea591-34f1-4a48-b119-f1e2e77a671f|Grey, you've got to be careful with this technique.
e3df82ef-4d7c-4320-b710-5513712b456d|Let's just try a new technique, shall we?
8cf112d9-b2a0-45ca-b9fa-581548ce5321|The technique we've shown you is extremely difficult.
847a8be5-1b02-47f3-b323-841ab4a51d46|Let's limit ourselves to real things.
5acc6eb0-ccb7-42da-8c4c-fcf430caa5f0|The only thing limiting you is your attitude.
7f0f4a7d-3bab-48ee-9993-91fa14455e7f|But how do I limit face time with him?
a6c2f793-e977-4caa-b357-901b77c01d34|At this point, the treatment options are limited.
97b4b1d7-7e3e-49a5-8f2e-08c7ca73a626|You shouldn't make your job your identity.
338ea789-f379-43b7-befa-f6d5d0f59e9f|I just love that title.
7247e96b-0deb-4178-bff7-bfbc16a3614b|Maybe later we can discuss my title.
7f82df8a-408e-450b-9b2a-4a7c1e64c43f|But the critics didn't like it.
a2bf0d88-c0e7-42ac-8454-0d25a2314732|Oh, so, what, now you're an art critic?
72ef1b69-0c02-4ddf-8e87-6689207e504d|My only critic perhaps, outside of myself.
96e3f318-8e86-47dd-9b35-2f31406efc05|Listen, you guys wanna survive?
c52e5880-11a8-4654-9f47-b2e4619c7297|I have to find my own way to survive.
febbeaea-0336-4898-8a16-a70b9eaf7244|He can survive without me.
33062640-f76f-4470-8a9f-4714b0b72a43|And you know, and you don't survive.
00181554-f77c-421b-be65-9ed3c2719423|Seeing him with someone else and crying about it?
41eb01a0-6c72-485b-a5fe-5e6bb187eb0c|Then why are you crying?
7595b40f-b1d3-48c2-98be-c5f96d73502d|And I saw him crying.
aac1c65b-2677-41cb-a23f-bfe5dea41013|Oh stop, I'll start crying!
4bd88430-8e32-48af-aa68-5e985affde60|We stopped our search at her border.
776d8805-75ab-4435-8e18-763bbee360a2|I can take you to the border.
4ff73790-98c2-46e7-8691-b205c25c7a23|Do I look like I lift weights?
20cb3167-6c80-4f3b-a639-b17980cd1291|Put the foot down and then lift off.
a41200c5-d781-41a1-aa1f-5b5e42c738fe|Maybe you should lift this.
b94eab0a-2a0f-4bc9-8883-6c3ccbe5767d|He lifted up our spirits.
8e604269-8aca-46c6-b9eb-82d11d95245b|This is the path they took, here.
08dd6bad-00a0-4d4c-a039-92d4ebd0106c|Is there a path at all?
be707495-9a1a-4bc1-9a3b-9631f6a6724d|Make sure those paths are clear, Bill!
5795ee4d-7766-42f6-8557-3ae9f9fc2d75|Can we not go down that path again?
ed42b047-8aca-455c-99a8-117bdaf2485f|Then I can better imagine the formal aspects.
da5bdba6-99eb-4d07-92ce-97d1a1382b5b|What aspect do you consider most important?
06aacc17-b76f-4f96-8905-e6bcba505dfd|But certain aspects won't quite add up.
39aa1efd-d0bc-4b39-92ea-7c53fd16027f|Do I have to marry her?
dda8479b-2bb2-4e5b-a891-7fc794126c1b|Now I know why my wife married me.
84443fbc-cc1f-4c4c-96c0-4d04f882686e|Who gets married on a Tuesday?
4c2b20b8-1dab-4d50-93f1-8f827932b7bb|He'll set up shop somewhere new within the hour.
7075214f-faa0-4995-af15-213d95da5592|I just went to the gift shop.
28dc3c89-4dc1-4d27-a877-f4ebd3ca76da|Because it's her uncle's shop.
39fe62e3-8890-4556-aee9-72a25b12eda1|It's a symbol of all my failures.
56c597c2-e021-4d2f-9223-dd991ac6c135|I didn't say failing, I said failure.
cef2a265-1232-4b61-bfbb-d1ae5b4cd0f3|Are you concerned about your failure rate?
1395f21b-85b6-4f90-93fa-db616027e728|My father thinks I'm a failure.
c7d9741e-5196-4e46-af82-5bd773ae9f79|I'm gonna ride the sky, Earl.
27ea5df6-f562-4d0c-99e2-aa0db3ec1339|You really shouldn't be riding it.
47504406-9eff-43fd-b8da-47e806ab72d3|You're really good at riding.
aef7d2d1-86a8-4396-b732-ee8d2506b2e0|No, man, all my boys are ride or die.
059a116b-f30f-42f3-9dda-b16734a0424f|Okay, we'll ride this out together.
818a0fe6-a364-45f0-b2a1-ba8f6437262a|From what I can gather, it's mostly weapons.
0469216f-ff8f-4a4a-9b50-bccb540e96b5|Rest, gather yourself, and then get that bag.
9e7a825c-cc51-445d-b17b-21a91a4634bb|Things, I gather, have gone out of control.
475fd57f-1ccd-44f1-81a0-37de9f6f0d98|I gather we know each other.
87714f60-7a85-4bbe-826a-8344d5384c9d|Didn't you just jump right in?
91ed10d1-efa2-4eca-90d2-d56f9379c5f6|He's not actually going to jump, is he?
70e06cbe-853d-4f82-b8aa-50b58a428b9a|Why aren't you jumping at it?
da28aa18-7665-4998-b0e7-8580b98defad|He must have jumped ship just as we landed.
1f4fb122-fb85-4228-8027-69b8d18473ad|People who jump off bridges but live?
a7022706-57a2-49cb-8c60-ce9020af9f80|Here, that's the sample you gave me.
d9224833-8b72-4d33-b3c9-156e5cf41b92|I found a blood sample earlier.
0ce3f17b-b7ef-4916-b42e-247fe0fe873a|A guy at the party offered a sample.
33bf7c6f-d022-4293-b5a7-1775982a2e0b|I think you should stay out of my affairs.
98393a0b-fd38-42b3-b0db-74ae9aaabe9c|He is having an affair, isn't he?
5dd685ba-7985-4597-a74c-d5e275bfa151|I've watched her results the last few days.
963d2a3b-1a6b-4cdb-bd61-6b0280a8ded3|Some cases have even resulted in death.
29cd69f1-eb3a-4a45-ac2b-aec3a6d84557|This threat alone could result in your death.
89fc1392-2068-4410-95b8-d7cc54560142|Failure this time won't result in a simple transfer.
3f9e6d48-3dab-4acf-bf44-2bb109672647|Yeah, but it's worth it seeing all the grass.
8230b35d-db04-4e79-8462-2a73309f162e|I think she's worth the risk, though.
158ec9ef-a53c-449f-bc64-f02bf480c341|I think it's worth a lot more than that.
3298ef50-4d6b-494f-be43-c9708025a548|It's worth checking her out.
a2d42bb3-65bf-446b-979d-3c2cdb4fa8de|That's all she was worth?
653a3392-fe31-4d1f-8705-8de3c0de6307|But he's got to fit the world.
e564f921-8c9c-4294-8c30-e33a787d977e|We'd never fit in at a place like this.
9cde29a5-d310-4807-a579-9054c8412914|If the dress doesn't fit, you can call me.
2578db0b-ddfa-49b7-b361-41d4ceadd240|I'm not following how she fits in here.
a4cf7839-bccc-41c9-9e9a-d5be6da1be6b|I can fit through there.
a0e15639-8c27-4e69-a0ea-9fbddbad8641|Let me talk to our chairman.
87431aaa-ad88-4a14-9be0-458ff2ad3aef|Tomorrow, the chairman pays his visit.
3458fca9-1aac-4f79-bb54-7a3ac96cc23b|Did you really hit the chairman?
5f1328fc-15a6-41db-8e88-e062a149e51a|Why would that teach them a lesson?
ab066077-74d4-4245-848b-2ad9219031b1|Well, then let me give you your first lesson.
4985db26-d78c-48fd-84f8-efa28a06ba4c|How is that for a history lesson?
a56083ac-63cb-4380-a471-52c6aa13801b|It's the most popular toy for christmas.
a110de72-31c1-4f87-8d82-18f229d558bb|He got an electric shock from some christmas lights.
48700b46-6cd0-44a7-810d-f0572d72b78b|Eric and I wanted a white christmas.
555932f9-7cd6-4215-8475-2687d5dd2340|Seven Christmases that does not come!
7dc5c005-c124-4225-be68-62ac411a9634|Then suddenly, all my Christmases came at once.
3f009f57-263c-43f2-b205-eaab129da3b8|This is gonna be my Christmas card.
b2afd628-052a-432e-9b39-444764313730|Tell her she has to spend Christmas by herself?
8a4c7578-a719-4de6-bfc9-dfda7c14b3d7|It's Christmas, and I'd like to be friends.
4d4ddd39-1fc6-47a5-97e9-93325346e026|It is Christmas, you know.
2e15700c-56e3-4431-a2c4-8e7b1ae6aed8|Because it's like drinking Christmas.
2425b918-dcc2-4c19-9c3a-ac20004d7783|Look, I insist you stop this at once.
b0a0951a-1fff-4725-9253-da94c5a17d33|Says that they insist on outside opinions.
23049832-8d78-4dfc-bd44-8249beafed8a|Then I suppose I'll have to insist.
9f16e089-6542-4113-b88e-d2efcab9f96c|Anybody there still trust you?
3a3917be-2919-4ac9-8d61-f9e2cd8b7f75|Anybody have a problem with this?
67e42980-d0b1-4b8f-8bdb-3203e691fc80|But I never met anybody like that.
2b592ee3-9afc-4116-a2b6-b943478eb504|Is there anybody else you can put on this?
411a2318-6be3-45cf-981f-aff8ee45d286|I couldn't stand anybody getting hurt.
6f66ee8b-3a25-4e25-b51d-4c28c5bf96a8|No, I didn't want folk pointing, saying things.
6253c197-9193-4653-a1ea-1e8cf3f30ce1|Why did you folks run in the building?
4dc91050-7b58-4922-807c-a9707055a82b|You know what he did for her folks?
05ca137d-c2f2-4efa-ba6a-9192890ef43b|Thanks for coming out, folks.
6bcf7767-4a20-43c9-bfd3-734f6082ebab|We're playing together in a band.
4c8b9f91-330d-4d7a-a897-ffb8e37a836c|Yeah, what happened with the band?
66577565-fec0-47f6-98e7-698e72b18c6f|I know you wanna see my band.
263a49f3-8580-49a4-ad9b-036e41a917bf|Not great out of this ear, but, yeah.
50c1c5b0-885f-48a7-a68e-cd291dff80d2|Maybe your ears didn't pop from the plane.
4d74576a-0b13-488f-a577-8aba986fdd65|Oh, don't cover its ears!
fcd46960-4402-47a8-8179-411863429a51|It's not about your ears, it's about your song.
d383a78f-5c50-40d3-898f-78da2c5a7ea2|I mean, it was the most expensive procedure yet.
f35a931b-831d-4927-9daf-61422c65cb2c|You can't start a procedure like this by yourself.
85617743-8348-4afb-a54f-c3cc8b0aff85|She's gonna help with the procedure.
512e0dbe-9170-4bc0-91be-1e873c9ff238|He's been over every inch of these mines.
be3d578d-6e81-4250-8017-6d5b219caa52|Two feet six inches, sir, and holding.
2ee2f7f1-ff8a-40f4-a8bc-5753ebed3706|Yeah, guy, move over six inches.
4d21449c-6ccb-444d-b139-ed5a6a740dba|This morning he refused to drink his warm water.
c4b6cbc9-9266-4a6d-a65e-33ac2f522ec6|You got warm weather resorts and cold weather resorts.
a93569e2-54db-431e-8ac0-648101564e01|Still warm for whatever use that brings you.
f6a0dd37-ea08-4ee4-81ff-d11d13431360|I took the jacket to stay warm.
86ca0b5d-81bf-45cd-917f-2d73c2e56364|There is a warm human being behind.
36f874b3-f302-45eb-9bd8-10ebd21dcb3c|The African stuff is way off.
9293220a-70dc-433b-91ed-0d561cea9521|I'm no more African than you are.
f37fe1f3-6ec1-4648-bdbf-268d1a9b14c9|I'm very familiar with African people like you.
f497174f-a110-4b08-870a-4989b781e29a|An African kid came, and they went off together.
e6ccabe3-d024-42d1-afeb-1bfa72d28e75|I told him I'd go meet the French director.
ed504ebe-e15a-4756-84d6-46656be3a3c5|You want I should teach you good French?
69c1b214-4a21-4652-8a87-622295e05b24|No age limit in the French police?
506b0714-5454-4f6d-8599-ebe57fd05f49|It will get your mind off baseball.
f086004b-fa3b-4b49-ae3c-293ab7748273|I said you'd never set foot in here.
16762853-23df-4150-b450-c20487957a20|You're standing on my feet.
ea7fd0ff-54bd-4d84-9038-ad1736e67c4d|You've already started off on the wrong foot.
e45120d3-5d57-45fd-9113-d560bb356c95|Closer to home, it's under your feet.
c8382a99-202e-4e46-848e-e9121fa794b7|Put your foot on it and stand!
2140c8b7-a1c7-40e0-849d-d4f30448aa81|We shall destroy those Christian folk!
37d30908-10b8-43b6-82cb-76bcd8e069b7|I almost feel at home here, my Christian brother.
1704be5b-b8c3-4805-a99b-987deb1055bd|Just think of it as your Christian duty.
93cf72bd-0288-4e91-8f16-683908dbb737|If you're not Christian, what are you?
03a5d35f-2726-4d6f-af3d-469a79624696|I don't even know your Christian name.
dcb135cb-330f-4305-b9e9-36a19f0ed1c7|We are approaching the enemy ships.
8e80e87f-dc86-40a3-9cb8-ce6c5d48b376|I didn't know how to approach him.
a21bee36-3a51-4a48-b89a-aba7f99613ef|First, we should measure her chest size.
a2c94e88-74e0-4544-91b4-94e84a9bcd79|Of course no one's measured up.
7598c36f-b290-4b5d-9497-20d3fa1cdc1b|Now measure the plate by hand.
8b798899-38a5-4863-acfb-3c3b58705c2a|You stand here at night measuring your thing?
d43e0e40-8aaa-47b9-ba2a-9088a70d3d73|But it's broken down and spread around.
600b23d2-a93e-4bf0-8b02-e93524d74c88|Let me spread my wings here, man.
9c577abb-88e7-411a-ae8c-9b9ea5ae0155|Why didn't you just ignore my mistake?
5c6dbeac-152a-4436-b384-6c72b23980ef|And they ignore our rules.
a2f49121-219d-44d0-a6ab-e7fd9678409f|You couldn't ignore me if you tried.
b996f3f4-0a08-478b-867f-658dc47bde25|Look, I know why you've been ignoring me.
61523f1d-6cd8-4aed-971d-13419d046286|It's been like, you know, just an ignored family.
74eef63c-ba08-45b6-886a-4d35836fc9a3|I have a very soft touch late at night.
390d99f5-a15e-4f42-8224-ee0744a29493|What, have you gone soft?
ad367b4a-4f3d-4916-a2a6-8a34a63d889d|I like my clothes, they're soft.
52c5cf4f-d6b6-435c-84d7-73e64bd770f4|I had a baby and I went soft.
1f43d3c4-ce34-4e05-8e97-a995d484b084|Maybe he's turned soft in his old age.
69d73024-80b9-448e-8ea8-af8e2aab3f1f|What is your annual income then?
ffc3ae33-27ad-4e2d-b085-3815b56d5e93|You're throwing the annual fourth of July party?
634729e7-1394-4d7c-9904-9cfe09755cee|Must be time for his annual Oscar party.
8b2980aa-067f-497b-914f-5aebdef546e1|I think it's wonderful that you're married.
4503f033-01cf-4b02-b846-094ce3e8270d|I want us to do wonderful things together.
c89ae249-4cb8-489b-86df-511e04f09c67|That's wonderful news, Henry, they're lucky to have you.
465bbb74-9038-4676-bfb5-e9ca46e30a65|But now we can make something wonderful together.
5101ec1d-fae7-48f1-872d-820422ff7ba9|Going down there, threatening them?
b278afcb-8d0d-43ec-a634-dba56a360b2f|One of them is threatening the other one.
b373df76-3be6-400c-ab29-6a00fa93a095|That depends on what you're threatening.
60a5d058-5bf8-4581-a949-7b02ea92a85a|But they threatened to call the police.
4ddcf39f-2bfa-4c3d-b8b2-79cac9f2a916|And now he's threatening to kill him.
f3e74f13-91f2-400e-acc5-7aa9b151df6e|But they got older, your dad wouldn't commit.
4ea8bd52-dece-47f7-91eb-b4cc1be66b56|Sarah's too tough to commit suicide.
5f3fc0ca-3d24-4a9f-95ea-b77746b471f1|Nature gave me what it denied you.
4699f9ed-998c-42d2-80a3-a2df506e283f|Why should I deny what happened?
9d49781a-406f-4efc-960d-f09eef488e96|I guess I can't deny you this.
c20d2710-55cc-4434-a87d-4bc416a6d604|I said she denies it!
25cacf6a-6198-454a-bcec-a2c3221856fc|The first thing you do is deny everything.
9436289a-3b06-4f67-8f11-3d6af8e7f04d|What do regular people do?
31a707f5-1213-4cbe-b9d7-dbb7bacddfd0|I wish we could make it a regular thing.
8feb907d-44ff-43b6-b363-d336a63747f3|I thought maybe she was a regular.
ade73faf-0828-4995-879a-170a32d3076a|It looks like regular food, but really tiny.
4e14fa6e-484c-4224-bf4c-182ba6e735fc|But regular people, they're starting to depend on you.
5cd0c3ae-f422-460e-915e-fa8921e321e2|You're a big influence on her.
e5fe19d1-bd48-4c00-8736-38a219458462|Have you ever been caught driving under the influence?
42ab9b6c-df38-4328-a97c-8ec5cf705e12|He hung out a lot with the army general.
a45ebc6e-54b6-4eb9-9444-2c99beb1563a|Well, I explained all that to the attorney general.
560240c2-efbc-4d1f-b755-de0a12ad6276|I'm sure we can get past this.
56bc80d1-f646-4ead-baa6-4e7f943ca096|I'm worried we'll never get past this.
ce6fa22f-fd42-4200-9962-c19e77f4017e|Could be a reaction to something he ate.
c81c4cce-6bf8-4933-9262-1bfa81498bbf|How fast are your reactions?
670afb28-4bab-4e8a-8dd4-7c9000839e53|Can I get a positive reaction?
fe7a38e8-a137-414e-a4d7-0afa52aea3e2|That's exactly the reaction I want.
053dd335-0899-4713-a033-5ab8b8e295f2|This is after they cross the river.
ebc73aee-a5b4-41e1-9d8f-37cc12615645|You crossed that line a long time ago.
41eab8ea-3d85-481c-b913-77ed2f703d9b|Do you think I'll let you cross my path?
774bd113-be3c-481b-927c-42217ad0db96|You telling me it never crossed your mind?
ad507169-c414-485d-9a74-a3e985af816f|We'll cross that bridge if we have to.
62e30cec-b5fc-481c-a365-a654c46d75be|Can't you just use your master key?
45e7e267-d157-4578-9047-95238c5b504f|You will serve the young master.
99f245de-c31f-4f20-af47-6edeb85595e1|Takes practice to master something like that.
92cd1a31-0b7d-462b-ab11-809abd061180|How shall we go away, master?
435c70e5-2503-48bd-ac1d-0a2c1b9d0f6d|That's the master, see how bright it is?
ea1c7e46-f0fe-4f93-9702-65e84ca24c4d|Just suits you put on, take off.
7a76d5b8-6cf4-4fb1-abd3-984abffaa2f5|Little brother, you can't even buy a suit.
5c4fc1c4-f50e-4f95-ad38-70adc9115ec2|I don't need to try that suit on.
3c854924-d2cc-402d-8507-90acb24ab8cd|Are you sure about this suit?
9ecbe9e3-c6bd-42bd-af77-fc2ca374cd6b|How could he just blow me off?
988eb285-3bd0-452e-b165-fe0f6bc16b64|She blew you off, didn't she?
d9db3767-ed14-44f5-b78a-2de07c51c70e|You could blow that off.
5eb5d767-c184-48e9-b9f2-f043d5b4d6b8|Go to it, blow it up!
414d771d-0b32-4edd-b418-520564a6cda9|The white man here is destroying our land.
93b8b016-1773-4acc-9b46-d92a5792e582|You say the word, and I will destroy him.
6ae64b47-df54-4d7c-b4ef-79529aac80dc|Several of our homes have just been destroyed.
e1d90a24-cbca-4d02-9022-71c1c6123dd4|Who are we to destroy it?
365c3b31-8367-4862-83ee-14e8588af161|It was almost completely destroyed.
b3d448c2-0851-40cd-ba2f-0d0ba3737f8d|I just need to get a gift.
fca0ca39-3d12-4790-bda0-89a80b2a61f5|I had a gift for making women happy.
8d2d4b40-b0f4-4c7d-bf73-93bfd4eb3fce|If I knew that, I'd return the gift.
503600c2-cb18-4de9-9ab7-72f8a5246b8c|You did not have to buy me a gift.
1ae2ec93-21c1-47b3-8aa3-413e0bfbfa45|But I must drink my coffee.
2711adfc-0c83-4b00-ac1f-2a8d655e5ce0|I just wanted to get some coffee.
982295a2-36e8-4f41-894c-6afd3f3826b5|He's waiting in the coffee room.
23acede4-524d-4806-99f3-b21cf25a115d|So anyway, that's the last of the questions.
cbcdab20-ef0d-446b-8901-e4afe251e22f|What is she in here for, anyway, exactly?
bbc9f029-1939-47ce-b1a8-54302dfee1fc|But they're not just gonna be for us anyway.
a179d02f-417d-42f0-a596-d8de6c4efa55|And why do we need a new place, anyway?
d8d1b7fe-4fe0-4a95-a614-d26bbf7abbaf|I mean, I didn't really want anything anyway.
714c85ab-fcd2-42f8-902d-613dd016aeb5|We can spread our beliefs with this.
20bb19f1-ffc3-4d9e-be45-611b01c6c0c3|Do you share that belief?
4d2f613b-08d8-479d-8608-6c4e04064121|They have their beliefs and I have mine.
4028130f-c70a-491f-8b69-6e1fabf6a172|Are you still firm in your belief?
82dee6f0-a86e-421c-b391-f1b6fdaccd9a|Your beliefs are none of my business.
c4526b04-1b6a-4ca7-8d96-63f8e6c988af|I have no comment on the matter.
e7212725-9fd7-4eb2-a1de-2c029e8d0090|We'll have a comment for you by day's end.
da7def34-812a-478d-a1e2-4aadf0aefed2|I have no official comment about that.
2a2354a8-5e60-43a6-9fb6-8b3c232710c5|Are there any other comments?
c4de2ee2-6856-49c1-b860-299c3774ee2b|Yeah, well, apparently, he's not the only one.
1556edab-f2ed-4348-a2b5-3d4a81abb120|But you still think about him, apparently.
b19efab2-7ce0-4a7c-b9a2-29b8e11d1d33|Well, apparently, something got by her.
f5bdc3e5-8660-4952-bb77-f461b80f3305|Apparently it escaped your attention at the time.
969dd56a-8011-47d7-b575-a2a23d9938e7|Apparently, I'm the last one to know, too.
f58ce3d6-1712-48ea-ad03-95e0f2b3eadb|You tried to kill me twice.
7d17e762-b9f0-43ad-ba20-1789bd8ec179|Not gonna test me twice in one day.
0e09119d-aaed-4de9-9075-44965681a3fc|Twice that seems like a good start.
29dc1a59-8b67-4420-bcae-b100c4b22aff|Sir, I'm not gonna tell you twice!
eec02612-883f-4427-ba1c-b3bb09ba625e|And I know this because I've been there, twice.
0fa89b94-1f82-4e6a-a529-6edd9290f0ed|It must have come up in your background checks.
92fd5394-7387-466c-a514-88962c02bdb3|Think maybe a background check is in order.
baa94e64-01d5-4228-b3c4-8234627cf34a|Why wasn't I invited for background?
7e8e9c32-9c23-47a3-beae-9f6ff49fd3a1|We've looked into your background.
b430c27e-bd2d-4279-9789-ccbff521b25b|I'll go back to my quarters and rest.
6e1e068e-f69f-4118-a87c-1376ae87a3a2|Let's just say, we're offering you quarter.
37e3efa6-969f-41c8-a1ed-0b01455c4a57|Every quarter hour is accounted for.
e3afe739-8b7e-48ee-b607-0d6c9ee917fd|Why don't you return to your quarters?
f6150c1c-1171-4e8a-a014-e54687401f9d|Shut up and go back to your quarters.
55f050e0-f265-4758-92a3-8b8f520c811e|We live or die by this review.
641036c9-e962-49e2-8a6a-9721bf835435|So, we'll be getting the review team in.
9166251d-f476-4c66-bbdb-254ab47282ae|I don't agree with this review at all.
1a0ff108-83e4-4bdf-a048-461bee3655d6|I'm sorry for not having faith in us.
5dd5ead5-79f0-466c-acfb-4da4de09419e|Your father never lost faith in you.
bbf170cc-0325-446b-baab-04827156d972|In many ways, my faith became stronger.
34e06348-6477-4c49-bc69-73aae1dc91cd|You have to have faith in yourself.
ce249e9a-a7b4-4c58-b6e3-c9205c6af9a2|He was shot long after my move.
b39c9b44-8683-46ce-b70b-4b21b25d1c75|What kind of move was that?
4317f8e7-567b-4fbc-905e-742a67d3fddc|For the record, I was against that move.
6014b7dc-6020-4482-a6f4-c603689e7995|Would you get a move on?
51e994c0-6fb5-412e-b028-d417625e8242|Remember, this is speed walking, not running.
7edb4c5a-e681-437c-a0c8-271c3e306c51|It's like she's on speed or something.
2f788625-cd66-408f-baca-808702ed2783|Now, the most important things are speed and strength.
ce6c23b0-8f85-4ded-be1a-3ae55e4ae9a6|And I had to drive top speed.
65969d9c-24c1-477b-a8d0-50934196f189|You are truly engaged to be married?
d6ceac8d-49d3-4f94-bd7e-1281bc0847a2|I'm engaged to a really wonderful man.
40d039de-0000-4eaf-8408-050438139f3a|They were engaged, but his life fell apart.
ca43b0f4-af3b-4872-bcc1-6dcce16e879c|You're engaged to some doctor you don't know.
e7023423-57c6-449d-ac20-bf8d7acd9212|But his shoulders are broad.
c0f64f32-64f4-4aa7-a762-c30b91215242|How's the port police broad working out for us?
60bb508e-6cc8-4598-9420-3b0ba24d9b69|We got a lot of broad symptoms here.
ddf92571-ec72-4b19-9a54-3de0f22737f8|Guys, this is a broad of the future.
65c4d1aa-7a8b-4a69-afe9-43c921a6f7e9|That is one tough broad.
5e553a35-56e7-472f-8fd1-25c6c905c268|Or even ever so slightly alter it.
eea8b4ba-afda-4a6f-bccb-fc27ae804a57|And bend this arm slightly.
5b59a4ea-6fa4-4017-b4b5-12df724cf0e7|You're just slightly better at this than I expected.
f619f124-6945-45c5-81ce-485414a989e9|Some would view that as an act of war.
88784158-7785-4dd1-b5a3-42592bd68145|The viewing public likes that more.
7167d8a6-b37d-4c45-9c01-197dc81388b8|Okay, there's no brain function.
159c8b1e-bd4a-46ab-a859-cc7166fb9864|The function of the base depends on you!
8dd3686a-3786-4a20-ab48-b4d5dc3059c2|And where is this egg now?
65ecc2d5-771c-4065-bf81-5764b26cf39a|Okay, what are you doing to that egg?
9779bba3-3d35-487b-ae62-c42e24cf89b3|I got the egg, I got the egg!
4af5222f-31bb-4bf1-a679-b80b210acce7|You can't just keep charging into this.
ed978f00-67a0-4fe6-98fa-1abf67b53590|They didn't have anything to charge him with.
9028d328-47cf-489f-b402-b5994873b277|The waves go in, and the waves go out.
934943ac-8a1d-4133-87b7-41e39f3a2c9a|And the waves will come up again.
6da0973b-7e6d-4cb9-b0ce-c99da2a95e7d|I heard female white knocked you around pretty good.
22d67cc2-5fe6-4c87-b7fe-6c9c52886e49|You, as a female, are far more interesting.
3efd4392-3dab-48a6-8106-7ebd10e609d1|And she's going to pull all his female support.
c24a26b5-0bad-48ec-9c0d-6310f1d16c61|To me, that sounds like murder.
6eccab35-2929-41ad-95ea-67f7656759e1|This man's wanted for murder.
862dd13e-6885-43e7-abe4-641ddd593bc2|I'm just on my way to go murder somebody.
75c7145b-f485-4c8d-9ff0-de314e24eca9|Your heart still thinks it was murder.
9c061e7c-23b1-4ee6-b340-8b29c9cf6466|I have you on tape, Peter.
1a077b03-4030-4ee5-985d-0d2a2f96459e|I wanna put some tape over the death button.
b98b68bb-a12b-4f19-8204-781252915ee9|That's why I made you this tape.
fedee1e5-e25b-4616-a7d1-8c91ff05eae1|Your rules, my backing, no red tape.
4634030a-1ead-4274-99ca-c8587439739a|I'll make sure they burn you good.
db6d164c-e39a-4a9a-8b0f-25fac0289d27|He says you just got burned.
3a8b4ddc-ed02-4d90-acdc-561e1dbdbc09|Should we sell it or burn it?
8f9ebd6b-a788-40ca-b0f5-d2df2bce9bab|Must have burned up all that money too.
7640df8b-e984-449d-80d1-051575e8119e|It burnt through my eyes into my mind.
4075de07-0130-4701-beda-84511e7837c4|By all means, just walk all over it.
8d605065-ed65-4629-bd59-2ca21952fbab|I have to talk to you by all means.
4494f43f-1f89-4ef3-b3dc-b6b829d76319|Means he's planning on engaging us.
b9d0f331-1d94-4ba7-937b-f821146f9405|Oh, then by all means, dress like that.
c1559c1f-e25b-42f2-9e62-e6eb2dad3141|Well, we think it's a mistake, don't we?
a215b5d0-fc38-4d62-ba16-28538cbac9fc|I think you could have made a mistake.
61521887-10be-4530-a9ed-8f511f642373|I won't make another mistake like that.
4c5546e8-4048-42f3-b5c1-7e492f07694e|If you want me quiet, it'll cost you.
75a7d53d-627e-4e29-9fd1-28d69259a552|I was hoping for a quiet day.
71600e16-48e3-4eb9-9f4a-9d7bd543cf29|When is it ever just quiet?
a59702f8-8b86-402e-bcc2-7cf7b7e7a588|As I said, it's pretty quiet out there.
d4d6242f-52e2-4e10-a2bb-2f2ed843618f|I'm just offering to help because I have connections.
1fdbae99-9516-422d-b9d2-25add3f3acae|But another connection must first be made.
359fd761-ebd5-43f9-879e-e21e3b053cf0|And it's true what they say, there's a connection.
89d5adbe-ea67-4bea-97a0-b6d6a9334517|But I want real shoes.
e307aa83-5bc1-46b5-9879-6b8430749f8a|Before we go, I'm going to need your shoes.
8bf93334-48ef-4a43-aa75-8f8e1837882b|These shoes seem to fit you.
b3ee14fe-3870-40f9-9852-7385c3e582be|His shoes are nowhere in the car.
6fa06c37-627f-4493-a4bf-c001658ab81f|You totally make those shoes work.
8595f75d-9aab-459c-8108-ce54f3e574be|She doesn't care about clothes.
8d5d6bde-b092-4c8f-9c2d-32896b2709d0|My daughter needs some new school clothes.
5003164e-d033-4a15-848b-8a0b47306c8b|That's good that he has new clothes to wear?
7a9d38a8-4b70-4994-849b-2f7cb038dece|Was it taking your clothes off, sir?
5396a1bc-0d06-49de-88ae-0795f101b062|But I promise I'll be home soon.
48a2c39f-1d7a-4924-a703-36a25578ab58|I promise, no more questions.
23b1471f-3b0f-48f2-a5e2-88f16604ca18|And I promise I will be there.
9a09170f-980b-446c-b9f2-760ef5c9b805|I promise, I promise I don't love you!
cc00d1de-023a-45a2-aa8d-b7604e3f55a5|I will be home later, I promise.
3a63ddbc-1c5d-48ed-a91a-cd9a7191df8b|We can't discuss religion at the table?
e2a0d761-72a5-4543-ab8b-96cee4c408b8|He's already got the big two religions covered.
3c293c6e-c0c3-44cb-a42d-a6e5275ff5a2|People who wouldn't think about religion.
31af2f1f-861c-49fc-a1f7-3f48d8460524|That is religion it is not science.
a7ff0486-31d4-4ab8-8ae4-b3795a7ec456|People have done worse in the name of religion.
535dcf03-6cee-4844-9b0c-80e6636949d5|You know, they just sort of appeared, complete.
1a536dbd-37fa-4ffe-9063-0b855e554472|We're united together, we are gay together.
4456af28-9af1-4ec1-82a3-1eed05375573|But our survival, it depends on our united front.
b6729431-a5a0-4b90-82d8-1f98631fb497|So much for the united front.
362498f0-96b0-4a36-b14e-f1f68e25f344|Not with all of us united against her.
dc2e3470-c823-4879-93c9-303ca0c03e98|We need to stay united against her.
63056bc6-1360-482d-8ac6-895c798fb04e|You see, in here, we're all united.
5fc08ecb-c3fe-4940-9e1a-f093867e1757|The people united will never fall.
2bcdaa86-b32b-4bda-ba05-8e19b78ac712|They could take anything you say out of context.
89f8ffe4-9abc-46d8-a319-d161de3ff851|I'm tired of being taken out of context.
f9471d63-198d-45eb-8ea2-eb1cac934e52|I got it in context.
207666bb-ef34-4428-a91c-c7dedd63ed14|Your place is still an active crime scene.
aa2dd09a-1075-4d23-9582-b0786aa6eed5|See if there's any active security cameras around.
773f3822-56f4-43c9-8f8e-38b2de5da14e|You two just focus on getting back here alive.
47cdf9d5-6041-4c47-ac7a-456d11e1721c|I like life to come into focus very slowly.
2faa5a4f-5702-4320-89a7-aefdbffc13d4|All your focus must be on your spot.
df842186-9bd3-4052-9e0a-66980b514ba8|I'm losing focus from myself right now.
13057412-5fae-484c-b7f6-5ee6d5f3b2a4|She just couldn't face the loss of her youth.
82255bc5-c603-49f1-9929-96404b14fa1d|I'm drawn to recall that day from our youth.
8b304afa-39b0-4f49-b5e7-4d21243a0648|I need a clean up on location one.
145eefba-20f8-49ab-9b27-6e8802723824|There's none near their last known location.
5dab0ffd-3894-4cd3-a7af-2c18c666bc1b|He reacted to the size and location.
03931017-f4c2-466e-b0c7-f8d496ffd6fe|We're heading to your location now.
9b0697a7-d865-4cc0-b862-3f18f628e062|She's just checking our location.
f9ef5c92-8d11-444d-9686-95453a7c9264|Is killing your way of loving your neighbor, Antonio?
5a1309a4-d35d-4d61-acb3-606c9c92359e|I'm talking about my old neighbor Harry.
1d9364f7-87bf-4554-bf49-bc84e9023a05|The neighbor had to bring her home.
9313bedb-300f-48f5-abb3-bab6615e2b32|Got hung up talking to your neighbor.
a1d67b6a-dd5a-4d5f-9389-1ec4c9c960a7|I thought you were my neighbor.
de2992c6-4e2d-439b-84be-c361df6811f0|Okay, then why are you all dressed up?
fc9fdd9a-c33e-4ef6-8d0c-d1a692df4674|We'd better let you get dressed.
2d0781b9-2b6a-4557-b2c7-7f584bb0f631|And, by the way, who's been dressing you?
c54b9504-c93c-43b7-8fe0-af60ddf56c5b|I can't seem to get on the internet.
33e7d406-a270-45be-b9bd-a47a240d1146|And I recently got internet in my room.
f623ea4a-17d5-4211-a9bd-f14c43c1b478|Who buys their wedding ring through the internet?
e56b9dca-e9d6-4b68-a318-a2ecb8fd8cf2|The subject of today's category is numbers.
656208af-65f0-4388-b42e-3f4047a6b4b8|This path extends around the island.
fd15c4ba-96ab-46ab-99f8-8a873b31a4d6|I shouldn't have extended the trip.
03a58aa4-f414-4f68-831c-3e8f1ae350bb|Are you sure you won't extend the loan?
ab13d83d-5a40-4f4f-b937-283a8f636826|But his employer live extending his contract.
1f2802bb-c167-44b6-a2e5-036e4a26934a|I didn't combine the characters by accident.
cd83f7b4-88fa-4a2e-980c-c81368685bcf|Who says we can't combine business with pleasure?
43171675-0082-435b-aec5-fa943fc9b986|I just have to combine them the right way.
2f69b14d-2203-4372-9172-b7e6b9f05989|We should demand our money back.
4071edb6-f3f2-404a-89bd-6dba645b1a89|Do you know how much they demand?
237dccc0-e4fc-442b-88de-444edafe09b1|I demand to sit with you!
a1f28dab-f1df-4315-8163-6b8997776836|He's demanding you hand it over immediately.
bed97325-8b62-4886-9604-0bdc1f86f682|When the coast was clear, I picked it up.
8864e2ce-e026-4942-a31e-db525dd1c755|They were heading for the coast road.
ba26e9f0-1254-4b94-8cd4-8537fab3d4b1|Once I hit the coast highway, I didn't stop.
5ce87f45-787b-4a2f-9879-ec50af619ce7|Keep your schedule relatively clear.
29d5f83b-185c-476f-9c88-0f33c5b6850a|He's relatively new to our family.
37d32671-453c-40cf-8cfd-25ec3c42d5f6|In truth, Catherine's been relatively kind to us.
0183fe48-82f7-4656-bd8f-8a4cd723f6eb|She should lead a relatively normal life.
2a0f5611-d5c4-4617-917e-10c481353642|He has that big smile like my dad had.
0e8f6319-6e86-4c4c-b002-c1b1ef684470|Put a smile on your face.
154acaa7-5622-4145-b0b8-d1d669e27c63|So be sure and smile at the camera.
3437d9d7-4b3c-4f15-a86e-8364e3521bff|Look at these eyes, the smile.
fbc6deeb-c0bf-4a4d-9f0c-4bab19452d3e|What were you doing that you missed your bus?
8fe37326-69db-4b4b-9462-93d5aa1901b6|No, the bus stopped right in front.
d2edec63-87aa-48eb-83a5-ffb04bb58ffa|We never actually saw her get off the bus.
154b56cb-9d20-45c3-bf40-896f1999d7b8|He's probably chief by now.
64c9ed43-7d04-42df-a72a-326c62de91c6|You know I can't be chief engineer.
3710ee84-f1f4-4835-9d26-acfc913af033|The bit about our chief weapons.
46b72667-a3fe-4676-b5c9-2db83f7629d1|The chief's daughter is a prize indeed.
cb8b28ac-c658-4b80-83dd-867dbd78c722|I think being chief resident has set you back.
f9b416cd-29f5-40f2-b4d4-bb6a75b8f01f|You know, the following facts are true.
fb30b635-70f1-4d54-8de7-50dcce9e5375|Trying to build a following, all right?
3897d95a-538f-4247-8ce3-6b5156a0a590|But he wasn't interviewed until the following morning.
8ce15525-803d-417e-847c-cd5bf6540ab1|I guess it depends on what they've done.
207b3835-1586-4feb-902c-924ef307c6f9|Or it depends on how hard he fell.
7bdd59c7-60c1-42f9-b809-c1d6a56e4647|My moods depend on her.
f4c3b633-a948-486d-ab31-baa4e31795da|Depending on me, thinking that I could do this?
035cb10e-8e01-4a18-9ad2-70ac8b6956e1|Using the missing key, you let yourself in.
5186fd99-bd9b-46bd-a4ee-67b5e1eff41c|I never should have taken his keys away.
d5017580-3470-404b-898d-11b09e1a266c|You have keys in your hand like you're leaving.
9d88b858-4dfb-4fdb-9088-3f23b39dd0df|Do I look like I have a key?
3a64cc61-c187-448e-90ea-157fc1293a27|I hope you know what the hell you're doing.
bd11b9d3-390f-4071-88b0-aa26dfe97929|And then there's gonna be hell to pay.
58064224-fbdd-4dc6-bfe1-c2de0727de40|What the hell is going on here, Frank?
71e61b02-4db4-4bb1-8473-32daad36c8f6|What in hell did you bring that for?
de73c8fe-a4f8-4a8f-8e45-06290a4b41fe|A lot of people visit New York.
25950303-3e67-4e67-9d72-cbbaf9741a43|Have a little visit with Joey.
80417265-3680-4074-84c6-526e3d1db1aa|Maybe I'll come visit you.
a84c787e-77cd-49d0-9765-9f301ae1fedf|Now, enjoy your visit, and don't worry.
cf79a094-1f7a-460a-9172-869cc4622768|Oh, sticks and stones may break my bones.
866305f3-c616-4646-ab3e-c18dc263ae26|There are a lot of bones, I think.
54ed86e2-462e-4a26-aa51-5d08ec65a8ba|It has bones in it.
1d681d87-1a25-4f79-b71a-76199d4bda0a|George, where did you hide that bone?
5faa5bd2-c209-489a-a36e-a7b96115245e|You pull your dogs off this bone now.
e253e185-e3f3-4bc8-b3d6-0fbbcc29ec35|You can cook a hot dog in three minutes.
3207e9ea-7dcb-46a9-bd0c-59c87ae01f1c|I can't cook very well.
54fedf27-c8b1-475b-9a06-a007d55c9ea9|Where did you learn how to cook like this?
db93c9d2-2768-4ab9-93b1-cd8f32a9813b|Somebody's out there, they're cooking up a new drug.
cbae739f-55d5-4d89-bcb6-d501d0a64a1b|I thought I was cooking dinner.
777d111c-d4e2-4740-8cee-fe97f773d657|And you never fired from any other position?
879f671a-3615-4209-97ab-53377df6fd44|He's probably going to fire you.
f854cca7-96b9-4951-a06a-5f32cb015b77|He fired you too, right?
337a56aa-59b8-4c9a-aae7-7e17fb1b8d7d|He says someone is going to be fired.
96df03b3-0a5f-4c11-94c1-7fd4094f008b|I didn't know who I was firing at.
c9d5b984-e056-4261-9022-632568a35aab|I think I was just direct.
ffdb981b-3471-416d-b38e-9ae2b86eabb0|I can be a lot more direct.
4e94222d-ce61-4d37-8f76-d1c51241a312|She thinks she's got a direct line to Jesus.
8f7552b0-7b54-4242-bfe6-cbcfee12b59e|In a native place, you mean?
e202e462-5d5a-4802-99a8-ae3ee8ea9c1a|Man, look like you've gone native, brother.
9e22be7d-f034-43c5-9add-1ed9dc07d033|How is the return to the native land?
01de5d27-1950-4ef6-87fc-6e3586ef2422|What would be something cool to do?
7b26a04c-ed7f-4964-923b-c321cd3629da|It's really cool and fun.
a0036fda-37be-48c8-b327-02736e714626|Well, you know what was so cool?
2ab9fbbb-6476-447d-b1a7-0e1d679d4f13|It is all way cool.
0de51d72-768e-45ed-b5ed-2fc8b460b458|We only need to pay a cut, right?
4e479968-5295-473c-983a-865fe510bf10|Why doesn't it come out of my cut?
6dba54c4-21f1-4af9-8787-dcc6410d74a4|You know what that song reminds me of?
58f67a37-eb0e-4373-8f75-1f8b1c75b716|You better remind him of that.
0c7f2b2f-d5ab-40db-ae23-1d53d38f6d66|But perhaps Kate resists on moral grounds.
c14f1ebd-a6ff-4d00-a6ce-fc6ff312c056|Does this story have a moral?
a7381a16-9f7e-4d0b-b179-7e425c4e6750|Make yourself the moral center of the party.
08e0d631-d030-4282-a7f7-3ada67dad34a|We passed laws, struck down laws for moral reasons.
c69970a9-5d00-41f5-88de-b490c642e13f|This is why voters have to get involved.
3fa8b743-a212-40f5-9599-e3c1e9f3c300|Voters need a married man with a happy family.
d14abe08-d601-4da5-9e48-9ea6160fe895|Are the voters ready for that?
4162ba68-dc66-4482-98cf-20913b96dab8|The voters decide whether you are guilty or not.
288d8e21-a9af-4732-8347-65acf0b13d11|I remember because I thought he was a voter.
97c75c4c-173c-4eac-b2e0-14b43593af4b|Another famous saying: show, don't tell.
9649575a-f249-43be-a5ab-18d740ee0d62|Penny, it's not about being famous.
38af3e19-26de-43a3-be72-af2a8a73e47f|I'm saying you should think about hiring a lawyer.
d61d67e4-8ae4-4ae3-a1f1-e568ea957829|Yes, who hired him, that sort things.
182154f4-54b8-4ae9-8dd4-23cfd1a14ef8|Why don't you hire a car?
04fb236c-1f64-4db1-85dc-0b37ec61af60|Well, I met Marcus and he hired me.
1fff1918-7211-4a16-9dd4-2fb613889744|And that is gonna lead us to victory.
ef5776a0-a429-4eb9-bd5f-75d4e7137567|I wouldn't claim victory so quickly.
46e056ab-61f2-4cc8-addc-5a45f27cdfdf|Didn't feel like victory at all.
ed0dc7cf-c8e5-4b7a-97b4-4652d1fb8c13|And are you wearing contacts right now?
5cb3150b-8c8f-49c3-92fb-de6053851761|Are you in radio contact?
78cd48f5-7ca8-4480-bef1-cc24da203724|Contact Donna's friends and family.
dccc5eaf-f0ea-4083-8a49-1147518451cc|Those clothes aren't even fully dry.
ecc3434f-547d-4383-8f95-2fba6ab2220e|Until he fully grows up?
d4b7d12b-4249-47ff-b434-ef8b0b82bf06|I suggest that you answer him more fully.
cb7c19c9-e967-47f9-a08e-cb7472558aeb|He doesn't fully trust me.
11e48b21-3788-4c8b-b594-86387001a926|You know, people they're always gonna be negative.
615dc0af-2f88-4cb6-bf2f-f81920fcf243|He's going to pick up on your negative energy.
23eb4dd7-6159-42ed-87e3-ece525dbe89f|I got your medicine, though.
d8a85317-bff3-4dd0-97d6-3f4a852e5b23|I'm helping you with the kids, with the medicine.
06b2d7b6-8863-47f8-bc2b-0694c62854ad|That would be the best medicine.
02c520c6-d414-45d1-95fe-c438e8827d7d|Madam, it is time for your medicine.
67e1fc1f-4d00-44ed-adc7-c4022585be48|All grade two boys are in, Nick.
b64f2520-34e8-430c-a72e-fc81a9378f49|All that stuff about grades is true.
b2f7da89-43ca-4b7a-bf5c-e03b5ffd0cc0|That's something I wrote in the second grade.
f35fea2f-2a65-4c45-b4d7-37a9cde62ad2|I made it in third grade.
25a06231-2e17-4be4-84d0-b3b166639d2f|What grade are you in again?
ff6f3e70-8d81-4915-8d4f-556cff58218e|We haven't tried Eastern medicine.
61193a5b-c08e-445b-ae91-bb01d7b3f8fb|The eastern army has been destroyed.
2d172ad5-66a0-4931-a478-de6fe12d0a9e|Listening to government offices in eastern China.
72ca8975-b14e-45a7-8db4-2e3e560935e7|Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's Eastern European, maybe Russian.
0e857854-635d-4a8a-9749-3906c219a81e|I haven't seen our eastern sister in years.
212c4dad-ca18-4b5a-977a-c1a28283b5b2|I needed the money for the kids' school supplies.
6bfeced5-751d-491d-b077-0749bbc63b9d|We'll get you some supplies.
a9c628d7-68f6-463d-b280-6973a42ba66a|Who can access your supply?
22f0c173-137a-4990-88ff-1f8c165f2d94|I just buy the supplies and drop them off.
ec5cfcff-7c5e-40ed-83d0-6c58460025c0|Okay, we just cut off the blood supply.
876301e5-0d72-4f42-96b8-c5ad17c323ba|Did you stay late yesterday?
ec01841d-979e-453f-8ed2-6d0e861356b8|Yesterday, when I wished it, I really meant it.
2f83335a-cf87-45a9-ab72-49e4f973022d|I remember every move as if it was yesterday.
4142e6ea-f7a4-444f-8d88-063d20889580|You might not like what I was yesterday.
e45b6870-65db-4de6-88e9-2a3eb99d287d|Have you seen him before yesterday?
03ea39b5-a852-49c0-a140-f5cca9bd7124|These people look familiar to you?
94897ffd-3bb1-428e-9334-4ba0cbc9bcfa|Does that man look familiar to you?
f7f0314b-913f-484c-8b90-43091f493f7a|No wonder he looked so familiar.
45b18a36-d0a9-47fa-aaa2-0d21ca9c107d|Are you familiar with this specific matter?
699fe4ad-01fa-49b1-97e1-0cb0bfad125d|Look, Sam, he's familiar with cases like this.
5ec0210e-a85d-4170-aeb1-1b9e34c66779|It was a kind of laboratory of democracy.
75418ec7-5316-47f8-9eeb-e0087353b527|They believe in democracy, and so do we.
9e7a3ff3-10cd-4141-b244-ca7788ffa4eb|Creating false stories doesn't make democracy more equal.
22e282f8-dea0-4afd-bac9-9614d92faee3|That's what's great about democracy.
71d3b00c-ddbf-48ee-911e-33d35b559f01|We live in a democracy of one.
894247bc-1f26-4124-8d05-871a3e12373e|Listen, you need to grow a pair.
d2b28ffa-c007-425e-b48d-0d0a7d1e1878|Still, the pair of balls that kid had.
72262b01-d825-4882-8a36-e7413bbb5902|Go for a drive or something.
2562bdf3-4383-47da-b1bb-39fdb15c8c0b|Okay, let's go for a drive, shall we?
515eaa0d-f061-4ff5-9855-270ba7b5acb5|Do you want to go for a drive later?
a293a2e5-db6f-4ea2-9c62-f39116c68063|Did you go for a drive?
1c4fcdc6-ca78-49f6-82fb-f6a8f7e4ae26|It doesn't look too healthy, does it?
389fab1a-e3c2-4394-ad73-932438627889|There can be born healthy child.
7bb72ed5-ca35-4413-9a55-3517835f9bee|I pray that my baby is healthy.
df3e030d-517c-450b-9f29-39ee9c83e2e0|I think most healthy people do, yes.
166b39ec-ff41-4567-808b-c7045bc2b17e|I got two hours to get healthy.
08b6199a-77c6-41a9-ba31-dd1f7261e567|You got your whole life in front of you.
b80d6a51-d464-4a25-bc3d-4b8ccd7d4063|I have it in front of me now.
ded8e306-7ee1-42c2-a783-3b5d64ef5076|I know who I was in front of.
8e8239cb-ba36-4ade-afa1-06960d45c497|I did it in front of your face.
78f3dd7c-eba0-42f4-a205-dd07f4e61d81|Let me not fall in front of Rose.
66dfabc1-97aa-4543-bfb6-3f69e8d94e08|Who tied her down, you or him?
e9cd9270-c474-40a6-a625-9cede263578c|Us going wasn't tied to that money, though.
6feb9e0a-0a65-47fb-a233-78849ac2e92b|But I can't be tied down.
caa02ea0-5059-42bc-a417-187ce8a21bc0|Haven't you heard about birth control?
3165648f-209e-4229-960f-b5cd6637594c|A tradition passed down since the birth of Canada.
9f868492-078f-4658-a6b6-127ec1f5867f|Do you mean, was it an easy birth?
776497d7-6b7e-45f6-bba8-c91a4a3e6f3a|I gave birth to my baby here.
17e85d62-9ea6-407f-a29c-53d8d7c1ef8b|Okay, we've made some real progress tonight.
3e96054e-ce29-4410-81ff-9fa4a240b247|I think I'm making progress.
d897d6ac-ba46-4c7b-8af4-dbd9a0b8cf01|Well, I'll consider that progress.
35bd86a6-e1ae-4322-aca4-7afa1562058c|Okay, we are making progress.
2343f876-88f5-4ebb-a78e-53233ff16288|They could do some damage.
4981bb37-0870-4bb3-acb3-331e90f7d4dc|Go easy, or I'll charge you for the damage!
904978b6-aab4-4042-9324-e067074aa646|I would not have called that much damage.
6063c5b0-8b24-41e6-97d3-6242c0a74ed5|It gives you brain damage.
e0f790b2-711f-4da6-afb5-dce474f37392|I'm just saying, he did more damage than good.
e53e5e74-ed28-4bd8-9741-a19020ceef49|In exchange, you cover me.
27aa1620-4afd-4185-aa22-6803b8a678e4|I give you money in exchange for some sugar.
84008721-74e4-4155-83c2-045ed45bd7d7|Did she just visit his bottom?
4e09d309-38c1-47fc-9fcb-01460779080b|What's at the bottom of your bag?
7b3058d5-c34a-422c-b2c4-a79a3d0f014b|I will get to the bottom of this.
5266d2d9-9d12-4cc3-aa41-a04f211301b7|We found you at the bottom of the stairs.
2e6ca175-2aab-4cd3-a25a-94a88a9e4f9f|He's in almost daily contact with his government.
d7823ff8-e5c0-435e-945b-acd3f5f0c77e|Do you want to lose your daily wage?
8c8a2a61-8403-4415-b37f-b832a60c26e2|I get daily report cards now?
385c7f30-5ade-4470-a053-58edb856270d|Why did we even grand jury, then?
b55ba1ef-b3e1-4aff-9f1f-d55a83f4d766|I'm glad you all had a grand time.
eab65ab6-bb68-4e09-aa0e-f8f05a1d5b2d|Each job pays four grand until you've earned out.
c4f75c9b-d117-4a3c-87ff-833a2d52e6b2|What if you lose your grand child?
6225f3f7-3131-4d15-87bb-0eeb3e96edaf|Don't put on grand airs!
9cf4b691-1ce5-4c95-9d6e-78df2f75ae0a|What did she write in her journal?
50f8df27-4ae3-431c-bcb6-8e9db30d2669|Catherine, it's a journal, all right?
2fcdd6e2-808e-4843-8cf4-3bc2c286b5f8|He kept everything he found in a journal.
f989aa1d-1708-4a61-9755-ec252d6f1757|You didn't read the journals, did you?
7aa8e089-4638-4a31-a262-601042849350|Last time it was his knee.
070fe504-5422-46e4-9ec2-f144d22c62aa|I turn to you on my knees.
516baefb-5af4-4393-bca4-7d091077bc4b|Get on your knees or I'll shoot!
8a635ca6-7124-4852-8170-1af26129db7c|Her weak point is the back of her knees.
0e4b65fe-1c4b-409a-a2e2-df1fe495e797|I will shoot out both your knees right now.
73340641-bb56-4cf2-bd5c-bec38ed9f7af|You're probably talking about a primary bone cancer.
4bcddc7a-dfcb-47a1-89ae-3911eda3f861|Like one of those primary school sports days.
c9a4a398-9d16-4d2a-8bb5-33d5356726b2|Your primary job is to stay safe.
0abca499-ca5b-439c-8f3b-8843dcdcba58|Yes, on Monday, you'll go to primary school.
757cc485-1335-40b9-b68a-14f400b6b855|Otherwise I'll hurt too many people.
e9470afe-3bb5-48ac-a366-405f50b42072|Otherwise, I'm late for the afternoon movie.
962e4827-c2b6-4cff-a2d0-5cf9672dafd9|Otherwise, why choose somewhere so close to home?
2068fdba-5850-4abb-b683-e52a867fe70d|I'd say he's never been trained.
2b2d49ca-2c7d-49a2-b149-7a677fa86312|I'm not even trained at that either.
a284850a-6ac1-46b2-810a-77c753c37c7a|See, I trained him when he was your age.
b1eea4c1-5fe2-485a-a35d-fa556a75d4a2|We should grab dinner or something.
88e9b347-26e4-4c84-8636-054983bcad8a|I must grab something at Saint Jean.
646be3f0-e2bd-421b-9edf-4a58d54da58b|When you close this case, let's grab a drink.
9f904907-7e27-41bb-b10c-419e0b3f803c|He must have grabbed it when he hit her.
c0a1d9c8-75fc-4055-a752-41789f221a6b|We can bring you the leader of the circle.
234678a1-0336-486d-91b2-7d8d87f6d418|Circle of your interests has not changed.
e21c8cca-71f1-45aa-815c-d4eff25ed096|All right, here, join the circle at least.
e3fbeb5a-8f34-4da9-a1d4-16cde2206029|You see the circle on the tip?
50dc9e1c-b246-4df4-84d8-0d887fedead6|Is he leaning one way or another?
953b0593-b90c-489a-89bd-33ab6d35ea35|I could lean on it.
a1f90474-ae52-4351-a685-de3d17846e75|Don't I at least get a glass of wine?
e32e4ab3-8883-4bb6-9151-48a7f075e799|Will you have wine, sir?
9b726c76-19f1-45e9-ac82-d3bce45077dd|She's just had a little too much wine.
6abb9a5f-81da-4bb6-98cf-58eb1d6e2200|Do you guys want some more wine?
26f70bb8-5125-4001-93e5-06942f1d649c|My men deserve a rest and some wine.
904af5d1-7373-4127-9f20-148ed21af062|You will find another minority.
b4d969b9-e1d1-44ee-9d42-2a1a7152560f|You'll never make as much as a minority.
e99da500-202b-4159-be9e-0e470666f286|But I got the minority opinion.
0dfd9cfa-5210-411b-9d23-926018bf03a6|Why is minority music important?
04d69e34-6e4a-4f87-95af-89ba01925542|In fact, I married a minority.
3f4c137d-1e42-4e6c-bc13-7daf7d456624|I've brought some flowers for your church.
20cc675d-6bb0-4e9a-a21d-33a84ae00fd3|We get flowers all the time.
e1f465dd-e851-47d3-8cca-bab533da2801|No, we didn't order flowers.
e754edcb-8b81-4399-955f-e383b50aadd5|Since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
c2d28958-947b-4d49-8ae5-8b65d89f2dc3|You destroyed my device, and my heart.
d8fd0c59-b853-4923-811f-f7742d550b76|They'll find us if there's a tracking device.
968f360b-3201-4dd8-a259-f363e78a2f6e|And this little device captures all that live evidence.
c6fb5199-e02d-4b4e-bbda-0f69a8df97b8|Similar device, as far as I can tell.
8353e273-70fa-4762-9092-f84d6291b72e|I am just a regular Iraqi man.
a6f01178-cab5-4feb-9982-49c5b693f286|And I almost hired an Iraqi war veteran.
21966220-43e2-47c6-ab32-fef43d8bb2f6|He gave the Iraqi people everything they want.
40ec7208-6d3f-4483-b8d9-1dec993aa38c|I think it's hiding with the plates.
ed2085ef-0288-46e4-b198-d9a5be8d89cf|I'm going to need another plate.
7fd8d4da-d02b-4c9b-85e9-c5b7e1f3834c|Quiet children, and eyes on your plates!
02bb56f2-de58-48f2-b3ce-d0f7f7ef1d9e|Well, I figured you had enough on your plate.
d980dbc5-e07e-4f9e-8b55-c1ab017fc4d7|This is just in case she's attacked by dogs.
f8be1173-6b27-478c-ba1d-26723a3f1bab|Did you see how they attacked the fish?
651ef3df-4255-4130-a1b1-cb5e9eab1dcd|What are you talking about attacking?
063cc0c3-10da-4af6-a393-79df35720b31|I was attacked by two men.
7942f8a5-0e7a-4d62-9976-dc1d8c60bc58|You knew they were gonna be attacked.
7aefbf3f-1cd8-4bbf-87d2-8acced544503|It looked like a nice clean place.
19b08b1e-f7fa-4465-9a62-36f50bfd237d|It took everything I had to get you clean.
86cff62b-ea38-4d5f-ab48-7db2bd6ede1c|That's the only reason why it's clean!
1175121d-800f-4c02-ba17-f9b4567472c5|No one is that clean.
4b44aba7-278c-4c78-a136-f83f9a6549a4|I was alive and dead at the same time.
6dc56ae9-82d4-476e-95a9-67983498dc4e|Didn't say to bring you back alive.
50ae7d9a-5030-4b5d-972c-53d785e7a753|At least he's still alive.
6ed2074c-7b3a-4517-af68-726673875206|It won't be much help, I'm not an actor.
164ecc49-9e74-40af-82fb-ef5526085434|I shouldn't even be an actor.
505fa1d1-2947-424f-aa7d-1dec1d86ce6e|She is an actor, not a race car.
eb12fe80-435e-4537-b268-e60b8f5e6866|And we don't need actors to play cops.
7e763889-e4d7-426d-865d-f907ac6b8104|I know she's gonna hate you.
e72f551d-c6c3-4375-a362-84599508d8ce|She has always hated me.
8f75515d-49aa-4c5c-a85b-f5962b5b2796|You don't actually hate Mary Margaret and David.
d68b59bc-88dc-45cd-8df2-649ec5a73795|I thought you hated that.
68302ab3-e607-4210-8229-212f061d2897|I just hate all this Halloween stuff.
79ad8e42-416e-4f2c-85f4-7d4293351bc6|Isn't that just a legal expression?
9d062b72-46c7-4baf-bf8f-c56d8a0a7442|I don't believe I'm familiar with that expression.
f82b8f3a-a164-40a9-a65d-317e8086e32a|Your expression doesn't look so good.
6660de52-249f-40ae-866a-157e5f0ce7c1|It's like an old expression for sleeping.
7c81b750-4a9a-4d7f-915a-e510620aff29|Don't put on such a sad expression.
a22adf8a-ae98-4152-8e8f-eebba5486b5e|We stay below and ride this thing out.
12b43fa9-08d8-41df-9525-13f1a2db1a47|Go below, find what French clothes you can.
9dfab352-ebf4-4a68-ad2d-10ac29e0470f|Should I go down below and finish them off?
561af12f-3be5-4ffe-ad01-59b3bf596d90|The sand down below was worked out.
be466a60-6f12-423d-a3e6-b176d953b7c8|They're all down below, trying to breathe through water.
1819a7ec-97f4-4c7b-a9ec-0be13ec264e5|Sounds like your father left you a bright future.
a31b53ed-1488-4a73-b0d3-e4a9c6bcfc2a|She's bright, very hard working.
3913bd3d-511c-4a5a-b2d4-b90dc6bceb21|Yeah, we did, bright eyes.
934c1476-3ab8-440f-a029-24c0c1dfdb18|Well, those guys don't look too bright.
cdc23834-023a-4708-9736-17bbbaff4876|My future did not look very bright.
e4c47fc9-af27-4981-8647-261d8038fc85|Now, I got pressing business.
faebb834-3999-4319-99ec-cf1296638ddd|But we will press on.
452aff54-5b9a-4f80-9a34-e6ab96a4e18e|Well, I would never want to press a lady.
cd36f5dd-49f9-4e54-9e53-24da3e842a73|We're gonna be pressing charges as well.
784854e1-ee07-4c62-9c4d-96dd25d2ab2a|And now, good sir, for our tour.
087e2934-76bc-4be2-ab08-9f4e9acdabf2|She's not done any kind of tour like this.
c0b09e57-114a-4805-89ed-23de5cd251f3|So, Amy's taking a little tour of the school?
0e79335a-5419-4270-8d58-7820d1ff9b55|He finished his tour last month.
510bb9ad-a6f4-40eb-b22a-d8d375e528e8|What are our findings thus far?
4acdbeec-5844-4c6b-8ea5-82a34854bd98|There's no finding peace after knowing this.
1391cdbd-16d6-4955-a1a3-552038644193|We need to stay focused on finding Tony.
4c250e5f-b483-4152-999a-b5e732f0e9c9|I knew I'd have to record my findings.
643b8e33-5997-4de3-a0bf-3166c96c6007|Who or whatever did this needs finding.
0101ed63-638a-4cd9-8fc1-8eb610594d6a|We'll continue with the next exercise.
0d75df14-5856-4bb6-8f56-fd182baa1333|A piece of exercise equipment for your brain?
cd7e4f11-6144-4663-8b52-9f1f76257ba6|Can we just do the exercise?
a059634a-f8a0-4ec1-a13f-79aa0dd2cab1|There's gonna be a lot of exercise this weekend.
5bc6a053-102a-475b-a78c-49fd58973048|Looks like dry cleaner plastic.
873bf28a-93c4-4ee9-a5f7-0f0f10763248|Gonna figure out what this plastic is from.
d37afff2-417f-43ad-b6e4-17607613db16|I think that plastic is the right answer.
147d2406-a2b1-4a24-80ba-060490c7a6d9|You guys, Ron loves plastic.
cc9ee4e9-30e8-4239-a0f6-471506ae4b17|What kind of plastic do you think it is?
5da4de56-f4c1-4c73-aae6-9266d489ea71|Your life may still be in danger.
c56b76a7-babb-4ff6-b4c0-9fe5183182e8|Put my family in danger?
15c898fa-8297-4276-95eb-e4597a656ec3|And how am I in danger?
b64eae7b-3732-42f1-9850-1431b12bcfbe|Yeah, but you're in danger.
5ece68cd-1dc3-4a93-b840-3a9bd0fc4b63|You could have broken your necks.
cfa463ce-39a7-4a3f-ac8c-6a1a2aaf1829|Can't really say it's a pain in the neck.
2b7553cf-5826-46ba-973f-5809a5b55a49|He touched your skin when he grabbed your neck.
93126ad4-bf00-4ef2-a45e-b87068ccc9f2|They're making camp across the valley.
cf06f776-513d-429f-b8f9-58999c17d062|I can't believe this powers the entire valley.
32b0c8e4-e542-498e-8ed0-9b84135e6bbe|People in that valley really are a problem.
1d2d8007-9bd7-4fcf-9412-d71bc00121eb|What's it like in the valley?
c3cb32d5-8a16-4856-8315-1c7cf61a880b|It's the credit you get on academic papers.
3e54b7d8-ad59-47d2-a0b4-5b5cacbcc47c|I promised Peter it was for academic purposes only.
f41ebd3e-f12d-46cb-9481-2d8c3c8fa938|That is your record of academic achievement.
9b41e12c-0d1a-4a46-86ad-626f4d9e605d|I'm talking about academic achievement.
1e8608e0-f575-4f7c-9d5a-fdd7a72b7b87|Oh, that was a bad start.
4df8a426-7fad-4e17-9961-48c006853bf6|I'm asking for a head start.
e7c97e7a-6a15-4600-895b-65ab008c8d2a|Too late, I'm gonna start in.
31043f94-d92c-4a17-91b4-ebd29e768878|I think that's a nice start.
4bf68638-f864-4480-83f5-0ceb25ffbf40|The truth would have given me a running start.
4e4b68dd-39e9-4a0e-970b-d2d3f9ec2416|I intend to see all my ministers alone.
0f98a338-ec5d-4d76-9988-e7920d961a0f|This I intend to make my case in point.
575668f1-59cb-4fbc-a792-e8654231ebb1|I had no idea she intended to stay.
317eb839-020f-48e1-9493-cb1b0eb395ac|This is not ever what I intended.
1511c49c-9b59-452a-ad66-7021b71a9854|Man was not intended to live alone.
f5d2eca9-6c95-4348-96a2-4bbf7927e5c2|See, somebody cut their male business parts out.
7c8c6d36-056e-40b1-9dde-32f2bb357218|Another thing about living in a male world.
cdf6fccb-564c-400a-b313-59db1ffe2c90|I brought us some tall cool ones.
bb06883d-6fe9-479b-a744-a27464587ac2|He's tall for his age.
fd5efc63-1133-47bc-abbb-39466632fafe|About so tall and eight years old.
8d8cd601-ea14-4308-9cbb-a246648c31ed|She's a little bit taller than me.
76944861-f421-449a-b3fa-98a8b33cf0fe|Look, just keep your mouths shut.
e0a8ebfb-7439-43ee-9ba7-c15ad8b6d6e8|Why don't you shut up, little man?
7bcfc257-529f-4f79-a700-5457b5e037c4|'Cause you won't shut up!
580d9536-7827-4b73-a35d-94a741ee0e48|They tried to shut me up.
2f2d866d-49c1-4a67-b2ce-5c63e2ba151d|Don't shut me in for life.
67952665-bc0e-40c8-bb55-213a364dd813|Indian better, make more children than white man.
5f6a15d6-fb5a-4e41-992a-737061e8b142|An Indian woman is still an Indian.
d4b74473-5119-4eb9-ad21-038c26fa09a3|Pay our respects to those who didn't make it.
6dc20c65-fd4e-41bd-8ac3-bd9e23701d1c|With all do respect, it can't.
5cc1e422-76b3-4c8b-901b-28f69a4ba16e|He will lose honor and respect.
9a1a919f-a8ab-4d42-a6c2-b33449be0adb|I'll pay my respects then get to work.
a66c1cd2-fcef-4d1d-88ab-5edd6fad2e74|Well, he doesn't seem to be just any colleague.
4ad66e27-9c90-421e-8a99-6cb9fbb0ab58|I just went over all these with your colleague.
5e953eef-389e-4b09-baee-30c5fdf9d260|You had an agreement in writing?
731ac4ff-5630-4e3d-9027-f6b637186ed2|There's some writing on the back.
4fd67581-c05b-4555-b79b-0a40d47bfe2f|I read the writing on the wall.
5af0d762-25bc-4c92-9dd1-efc62045c8a6|You told me you thought my writing was beautiful.
309d496c-d790-40e2-884a-ef5484d1e56d|When is it going to be done writing?
6bd853b4-f213-491b-9f0c-6049f2a7c33e|I didn't want to wait in the rain.
0271ead4-7a4b-4c86-9d20-74622d085493|Come on, it's starting to rain.
741869ea-731b-46fb-ae23-bbef5ac2cd86|Can we take a rain check?
54dff8c6-97ca-4c5b-ab8a-8c606dc45cc8|I'll be twice as fast on my own.
fe80acc9-087d-4a20-ba45-9d89e438f09a|Can I just change her real fast?
fe2ea72f-e0fd-40a9-b2e0-2e91a9abdddc|Do it, if it'll get us there faster.
e42fd6e5-14a2-4aeb-97d8-76bae63b9150|Things are going too fast between us.
f2055d62-347b-4a5f-bf7b-e5323376d846|Come on, faster, faster, faster.
2fb8c8c5-9733-4b6e-b31c-50b18e6e83a1|What a great name if you're involved in football.
d404a2ef-dd83-4e37-85bb-a9c8a7ace37b|And that stupid football shirt.
942ac5e7-e822-4d6f-bb66-cb10c2d4881a|You don't wear cups in football, son.
33175cfe-9d6f-4d96-b041-c166ba3b166b|You know, you're welcome to come if you want.
c834be5f-f629-4f96-91e4-acef6409370d|You know you're welcome here.
3a8aadd7-714e-4b1d-ae03-9516e6ce62e1|Why wouldn't you welcome me home?
fb475fae-f4ed-4f1a-a1a5-6b93b1cbf3d5|And it will welcome you.
abaaad45-2b2c-4686-9be9-71f8bd53311c|How is today's judge on domestic violence?
bd976ad5-e80c-48af-b26f-dcb3e27bb47d|See if there were any domestic violence calls.
f1c1ba3d-9803-4e92-9508-771e2c668005|That day at the pool, remember?
142aca95-01e6-4899-9aaf-10d5ff3218dc|No wonder they had to clean the pool.
1781daa1-8ffe-4b89-a21f-fa4950329cf6|I'll show you the pool hall.
4a166248-a306-451e-ae3e-dd82e5bb2430|She fell in the pool and nobody noticed.
30c8f8fb-6f2e-4874-9847-e3fcd2f71e5d|He jumped into the pool, I think he's dead.
a6f31dcc-bd29-40b0-912c-ed17229e9d7e|Our literature teacher in high school.
d326a16a-039d-48c4-a1a8-545bad679602|It appears in the literature time and time again.
85236998-dda1-4add-b36c-9a53047b5509|Here is some literature on your options.
4adaeeaf-8c63-4914-b0a8-197a62418314|Just some extra medicine, just to be safe.
b0c42ea7-30e5-4ba4-9dbc-d00eab4d22ec|I brought extra cameras today.
e289f735-f937-4835-be2e-5e02b976e9d7|Is there extra credit in it?
3ff35c19-cf86-4edc-8192-5d72a3b6cf33|Looks like you could use an extra hand.
974f9633-00f9-4efe-a498-a8f70941cc93|It's from the northern part of China.
902ecea7-23a8-4322-9a7c-a7df38922696|We're engaged in battle at the northern gate.
66597008-a2c7-40ed-9b5c-2525266d3329|That puts it somewhere in these northern hills.
9e49d6a9-a30a-4349-ab06-774febae5ec4|Do it, I have no desire to go.
4b3a3089-08ef-43ca-8a15-1d8a5fe7aa8c|I am giving him his heart's desire.
d9220e63-c8d0-41e9-b559-c56c60012b1c|He said he didn't feel any desire.
e72467e4-8338-42dd-8e32-c4d19affeb16|See his cup always full and all desires met.
71d9e813-218a-4bed-9d45-2b9c31a239d0|You will be directed by your company.
8c33b1b9-fd04-4eb0-a72d-39a0fc5b8c3b|I think this was directed at me.
a09abbc5-2e52-44cd-8dd7-d43395537af2|We don't want anyone to direct us!
06a083fc-0d2f-44d0-b0c2-936acc2b6230|How exactly did you get into a fight?
a88099ab-16bd-42f7-bd36-d9c6a9b95b45|If people wanna throw fights, that's their business.
6a6777d3-afb8-4a18-a3aa-abcc08827100|Even if the truth could start a corporate war?
b08f882a-356c-4bdf-856b-9c6bd6221fa1|I got corporate on line two for you.
6f659369-d570-400e-9322-4e17ec1b0294|So, you enjoy the corporate life?
6c7777de-d85c-4811-948b-699657b30008|You missed our study session again.
da681f48-b86a-4f80-bd3d-0cc97b8adf98|Yeah, I'm gonna start doing sessions.
b77bb7c0-6a7f-4f97-bbec-735907f23e97|Well, last night was his first session.
9f3bfbee-5c5c-4d17-96f7-ed1081754150|I just need a session, man.
e4700e09-5ac3-4259-b27c-0bc8491ef025|You know, you should be on the supreme court.
f498a2da-6eb5-49d5-b00c-6f807f29fae0|Only, remember, you are in supreme authority.
486246a9-9604-4712-b981-ddfa8c2938ae|Without doubt, it is our species' supreme achievement.
97adc885-8fb3-4ec8-9323-9a33e0259f05|He'll be on the supreme court.
b2dec7ed-9424-43b4-90f6-3093c7dd1363|We can't stay in the studio with my friend.
a18e2dad-52d0-46ca-a17e-685784a5a934|Then the studio must have real faith in it.
28d84167-f7f7-40b2-9e87-fb71902b1119|It looks like she's moving into your studio.
049a4bc0-c0f4-4409-8630-48c2a25f6837|I'm sorry but I'm still in the studio.
8eac5dbc-332d-4e9f-8d43-3ba0d312e8c5|Or studio apartment, if we're getting real here.
e9e2a433-b835-4ece-b2e2-5e7394ad7cfe|That means he's a very cool customer, your Russian.
0539ef88-17e3-4bdd-bf4f-295ac6e841b4|Yeah, that russian kid stayed here last week.
28539f74-9765-4bcc-adf4-8146c50ab07f|Look, Henry, she's been arrested by the Russian police.
ea67354f-7a70-4ba9-a365-f815928cb30e|But he's not Russian, is he!
fe07715d-5cc6-445f-8b8c-303c2661e512|Answer by just shaking or nodding your head.
ed162aaa-bd3f-403b-a821-5d4bc8780929|I know you're nodding back there.
d04e3f3f-7a53-4aea-bf11-94ed5d2e709d|Can't have a partner that's nodding off.
284986ba-fdcb-4161-be9f-3069d681c869|How long has he been nodding off?
86d94b41-dd97-4c3f-b61e-13ca97f33299|Secrets I've spent a lifetime learning.
89e26bf2-7596-4e05-849a-f02a0b6ea8c6|Her learning is an example to us all.
ff266743-39db-4f9d-892d-eda61f05a716|It's just like when we went climbing as kids.
1b86dcf6-2169-477e-b742-0bed332a8b7a|I should climb back up on that horse.
50d7bde1-b933-4460-99c2-2771eed64681|He climbed out of the window and walked away.
54d794ea-32f4-4032-a2e7-c9877a6623d6|He hates that I climb.
ddfb86d7-a372-4d23-848a-e4ba372197a1|It's Olivia's mind assigning importance.
8694ef4a-af87-43bc-aedb-e92f13315ed3|I mean your family's importance to you.
8d894ae2-91fb-4757-ac17-14ed7e4ab645|You do not yet realize your importance.
a0d62846-794f-4328-a381-46bd859f518c|What, you got somewhere you need to be?
f79ea456-7f7f-4730-b8ba-b72c93089d8a|But right now, she's somewhere in Houston.
51ca434b-134a-46e9-add6-b0697282fd2d|You need to hide somewhere for two days.
09c61092-45a4-4279-b42a-5a37d4141622|Yeah, but it's somewhere nice.
225a87c3-4e23-4eee-8882-b9be9079fe87|And this expanded your son after school.
478b26f0-ce3f-45dc-8674-394991dc4dbe|The only danger is we expand too fast.
ccf95df1-7d6f-44e1-9c55-1f816e540450|You don't have to expand your mind.
94654f29-69bc-450d-9db8-b293ae04cefd|It can expand faster than the speed of light.
d20b72a3-d80d-4ffe-a851-fa28ed686dc7|But you needed the land, to expand your business.
e40816ad-13fd-4479-acac-8b39955e96d2|They don't appear until at least the fourth day.
d62eaad4-198a-4022-b2c5-ee7ab69f6edb|It was our third or maybe fourth date.
47d6f7b1-de52-4ff3-a25e-763b48f65490|Is what was playing on the fourth.
d8daf947-392a-4446-bd90-470316392857|It'll be my fourth one in two years.
c8482144-ed03-4892-a051-520bfc620c34|Good, 'cause as of last week, we're in fourth.
b227c146-8b57-4c53-823e-538202966f42|He'll hang us both out to dry.
bc60d28e-61dd-4c50-9f6f-b34e0d3f74fb|The ground is dry as bone.
1804ef80-bf54-40b6-b9d9-6dade12c89d9|I'm just saying that I wash and dry.
33e9f7af-1e25-4166-ade1-91c839cc82d2|Something has changed and not just because I disappeared.
161cfebe-d119-4192-b004-3937ee4f1f96|People are disappearing and you don't care.
062bc6d2-03ba-4cef-bf93-89cd773a10c4|Tell us about Wednesday, the day he disappeared.
7c794950-702e-4317-8609-d4a4aebdb1e9|Domestic abuse, bar fights, that sort of stuff.
b7a47710-9f39-4257-bd31-2ae4c65b07b5|Is he prepared to give evidence of his abuse?
c00bc54d-bc79-492d-8bb6-fde3b622646c|We always have to eat Anne's stupid chicken.
71bc0107-4a68-4158-973d-2db4dec9da41|Oh, could I have some chicken?
42d96d2e-c4d0-4ada-8430-16c60d737fbe|It will taste just like chicken.
890797c7-58d9-4ef6-842d-442cca8061b7|I obtained a copy weeks ago.
74332b25-9648-4a51-a571-215910d496ea|We have obtained a security pass for this facility.
5d353948-f9a6-4095-8447-5348e0b90c38|There are things I can't obtain.
e2186cc1-bec5-496a-9807-6b70e4b6ecaa|Your first task will be obtaining him.
79b6868d-a5a0-4dfd-85a1-d5c9c22d623e|How did you obtain this?
6d0750a7-cb12-481a-a307-2cb555b3e98e|So anyway, he's given you a little map.
d1ae072d-d3d9-4044-9228-dcb7f3a3d569|What is your interest in this map?
53933c2d-3a82-4b19-b535-2501bfbe29a4|Are you looking at the map or not?
e7c871f7-ee95-442e-b3ca-38f2685e312c|Every night she looks carefully at my head.
cfaad533-98e5-434c-957a-6275314d303f|It's a noise, listen out carefully.
e461d0fc-8799-4c59-9e37-579f482b0c81|The police carefully kept quiet about another detail.
12ead89d-b00b-4e45-adc6-d00ae4842727|You listen to me, and listen carefully, boy.
46b0c1e4-15d1-4490-ab63-c61a95302ffc|Now, continue like that but close your eyes.
fe6cd60a-2b4b-4d59-89f2-4d32f93e6583|You must live close by.
2a13bd80-3fa7-4028-a5fa-129e84006653|So close that she gave him this?
030f8564-d103-4236-ad70-9829f9a6f4b2|We're closer to him than they ever got.
1e87c41d-31dc-4051-a660-039b8eafae41|Yeah, they are that close together.
bdc7cc64-d39c-43bc-ad53-8042756e87ab|You're reducing a complex human to a machine.
6440be11-7cac-46b2-9689-b6c4bc958576|Issues got more complex, and I grew up.
581cdbb7-b690-4fb3-836a-6ce6b4e20239|Is it all too complex?
8e43fe09-2148-4bd1-b1bc-36e9b80c25e5|He's very good at getting into complex systems.
460054d9-9113-4e6b-8764-ec51fea8e77a|It's all more complex than I thought.
41cd544d-f633-4038-9654-0d77a189b218|Metal is strong, like me.
f6659127-7826-402f-81b9-c83168f58c49|We have to get through some metal bars here.
5cda4607-3ee3-400a-a6c4-c909854927ed|No, just a little bit of metal.
1744b95a-69ce-4afd-86f5-bd4a56ffcabd|No, that's metal, don't touch that!
c0109bc5-7953-42a9-bb16-5f8f98f40b87|Here are the new lead sheets.
fd55023f-96e9-473d-9f14-510229ba5230|So, does that mean there's a new lead?
fc5f02d1-3b7e-4e14-8684-8b543710c1d4|I think I can rise above.
72128320-6c7f-4d29-a025-ff771908aaa0|You have gone above and beyond already.
00c328b0-ebe4-4b21-8fd2-efc1527a196e|Can you believe this was my first jury trial?
994707b3-99a6-463b-99bc-df018a7797d7|The jury's still out on that for me.
4c865cce-d6e6-49c4-b7b2-394bb53ab45c|You stand up in front of judges and juries.
26ed9dcc-882a-41bd-a9c1-b50fd67cd14e|Monica wants to see a jury find Jessica guilty.
d2b874ff-33b4-4dda-bb92-571f689feb75|Oh, I stopped guessing about juries a while ago.
29af2b49-27c9-42b2-b0c2-fba090b7406b|I told you, my sweet.
1d4561dc-fdce-41ee-8b15-bfcb89ca7eb2|Is she just as sweet?
c2f1db2c-1eb4-44f0-b082-8ba8649800d8|He's really kind of sweet in a way.
f02de4cf-0282-435c-9c16-da3ccdb1dc6c|It was very sweet of you to stay.
79dde188-4018-4603-9f42-51ae96d874fa|You're a very sweet little girl.
bbb02e80-b173-43a1-b45b-34038a207666|I just have to approve this proposal.
d5d8464e-a63f-4cc4-a4ab-7fa954beeaaf|And she won't see the proposal coming.
5b5e0488-3fa7-441d-b6ea-611dad10ad45|So, is this a proposal or a business deal?
1ceeae2b-3505-4c24-9690-6dc8634f262b|It wasn't his proposal, my love.
a1bd595c-4446-4c8f-b86e-decfafd070f2|And he put you in an impossible situation.
ae84e8b3-d9eb-4f87-9736-2a92807895f5|It's impossible to party like there's no tomorrow.
306be52f-e599-4162-ae52-65017f1df91f|In fact, captain, I would say quite impossible.
b954791b-8f91-4cbc-b8ab-6cab4c315c69|Yeah, I know, they're impossible.
db7e1021-6b8e-428c-a8a8-381c2d9dd3bc|First, there was the parking ticket.
f13b6709-cc55-4731-ac1a-dfc9cf96af01|There you go, one ticket.
c23ce5cd-85e2-450f-ad3d-362ec4c00d25|All we need is money and the tickets.
3b2be736-d5c0-433d-836e-39ffb98d3b62|And then slowly leaf through the worlds.
1008f40d-b73d-4d73-8292-e82e70c62fbe|I want to turn a new leaf.
0c584b69-eafa-4f25-af76-6a1441c3f0fc|I've decided to turn over a new leaf.
1b229835-9ec7-4e04-9b3b-cd97371769b2|Look- it's coming into leaf again.
486beab3-1ab9-420f-a702-ae1befbbf987|What about your activities outside the classroom?
131a31be-e8f1-40ef-9baf-d83b2fa99fef|Well, I was thinking I could just change classrooms.
87028c48-7194-4230-bd34-022c5cd0de1f|Henry likes to surround himself with pretty things.
64dee650-187a-48b3-9049-3f99a00a6584|We have the entire place is surrounded.
2a30f886-5ed6-475a-95b4-87a826b90498|They're letting you know you're surrounded.
2e980e1a-acc5-4a08-9e60-8e8c4f64b2eb|I'm surrounded by people who hate me.
d55ed97f-ccd7-4520-a79f-7555dca142db|Sounds like you had quite a lunch.
76c2c694-a9f4-41b6-b0d8-573cfd5f7274|Lunch today so I can see it?
b8552a46-c3c1-4a7c-be6d-8b6238ef979e|I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago.
30cac403-4796-4c50-94a2-6546b73b921a|I didn't even have time for lunch.
2da60252-11ab-40a8-8b91-9d6c5bc2f345|Meaning we're not ruling anything out.
af7517db-2f63-4106-940e-099b449383e3|He is the meaning of your life.
909564bd-f152-4c76-9ea0-b0d11b506982|It's what gives it all meaning.
6e1ad979-4693-43cc-b15c-29c9a34c6950|Keep meaning to give you something.
5124f25f-b963-4bd6-8a98-ce001f645304|It doesn't say anything about an injury.
b04e310d-2805-4d9a-8667-cb667adcecc4|You gonna invite me to sit down?
9d7dbbc6-4c2e-4af7-bea3-acf6d25a8bce|I also invited you to lunch, remember?
10471d0f-6594-4edf-a163-8abf4312fcd1|I could invite you for dinner.
76ac8015-199f-4cc2-b0e4-965a5e19a345|I want to invite you for dinner.
71ae8d8f-61e8-40e3-ae47-21a0a9a10613|And is that why everybody was invited but me?
54049eb1-68e8-42c9-a5c0-7dd81c22f45f|A soldier never says sorry to his enemy.
f427bf66-cde1-462b-a85c-6d2ed63149f8|Then would you say he had enemies here?
d28940c6-9515-4be0-86a0-34dc19db1d10|Even our enemies agree on this.
1c8962c7-f5ff-46c5-adb6-230160ddde02|That guy's the enemy, this is war.
cccbe02f-b636-40f7-9159-6d2cce3975e9|You're your own worst enemy, you two.
4af22aa9-ea39-433a-8dcb-68d76e5121dc|I don't care if I repeat.
f5e172c5-6285-42d1-bbf8-ed9feefa358b|I repeat, understood what was being asked of him.
a013fd32-05bb-431d-a294-cdbbdb2edbe7|Have you ever seen me repeat myself?
7732f18e-2dd2-4f12-b05c-3bd06c9ca9e8|I repeat; Something terrible happened to Eric up there.
c07acd92-7a67-4acc-a68f-72dcc55ad17a|You're making me repeat all my questions?
9f96c65b-67f8-49a6-8a2f-e07f432a4b58|It is impossible they bear it out.
548d373a-a4f0-47ca-bacf-17f89d0ac24e|Adam, too, if he can bear it.
b4d2572c-5ddc-465e-9185-7e29c27d5483|I don't want to bore you with job talk.
0624860f-b567-44a3-90fd-8b2fd54c8345|I can't bear to think, to be alone.
456f6489-ccd4-4b89-9bea-22da58a21b9c|I cannot bear that you deny yourself.
77596f59-b6f9-4d2b-80ee-b85904518e0f|I'll cut off your nose and your lips.
d61caa00-5f17-40cb-91b1-a37ba842feee|She likes to be kissed on the lips, honey.
307af9d4-ab2d-4448-9748-69657c54b736|I've been taught to read lips.
7d829ee8-ce39-4bbc-bd11-7b4238b8946f|What the hell does cutting her lips off represent?
601fa86f-c656-4a3d-bb9a-5f55abb77910|Your new mayor is tougher than anyone expected.
35e7bfd0-02fa-4c04-9daa-930feb531455|The mayor told me they were my father's students.
c52dd481-8174-42b0-a299-42ba2d251392|The mayor asked me to stay on.
7657888c-843a-46c0-8c40-08bf8062665d|She's gonna be the next mayor.
ad6fc4c8-d9ca-471a-85c9-6cc3beb12184|I don't know if I deserve this award.
73edb066-1fb5-468c-9c2a-46ed60530ea8|Like you say, award season.
5b52a1da-68ac-4c75-8675-12504e356851|You win the award for worst mother ever!
582acda7-a810-47e1-95fc-aba4113d38ec|They give out awards to people like me!
8fe14197-f7e2-4fd8-9900-782ddb6745d7|I don't need an award for doing my job.
1dc32e82-f7f1-423c-b4bb-7818a9f6aee7|Again, do not attempt eye contact.
7f96c9a8-c685-4d22-996a-d7d6dc49ec51|I wasn't trying to hurt you when I attempted.
34ab20c3-879b-4b4a-b28b-5788c399f3f2|No, she should not be attempting to talk.
91c38271-fc42-4bb4-9060-29fb6a051bd8|We made a commitment as a family.
2202908e-312e-444e-a810-adaf0fe853aa|It's because of your commitment to him.
c6fa7b0b-ec03-4342-9c8b-52ecdf4b4ea3|But I'm not ready for that commitment.
98274a8d-745c-4dbf-a61b-20003093835c|He'll have to sign these commitment papers for her.
4f6ba908-bd7f-4653-a010-c195213b8b3c|Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you.
4fd3e665-83db-46e5-8da2-43447108408d|Your focus groups, your polls all tell you this.
a553965f-b0c7-4da1-83fe-84857938a1f6|For an opinion poll on the election.
f13c56f8-be01-47ff-ae4c-4d4090e119d2|But Peter wasn't just reading the polls, was he?
50bac00b-8598-4e5a-81c9-4879f686b3e1|Yeah, but it's my favorite part.
5458e4c1-6112-4c75-82a8-d2a83f039e1f|She asked me what my favorite book was.
3dbb2c7a-b7ae-430b-933e-575b401d9356|This was his favorite book.
4d9cd4b3-2892-483e-9cca-f2d12562bcc5|This was my favorite book growing up.
f01e2523-b74a-48b6-8cf8-876115e1f38c|It was so beautiful, I kept exploring.
b0e52213-bb2f-4a4a-990f-35bbb57c0493|Think we ought to explore it?
0ee58b86-0c71-4770-a0a1-a456e0ce0cf9|I thought you were off exploring the city.
156acb10-863f-4971-8d66-eca2795ee2c4|In fact, she predicted it.
0bb6f471-3407-4492-990e-d005c1dd4c17|You guys are very easy to predict.
63dfd4a0-472b-49a4-947b-ec1903f1a5d6|I could easily predict this would happen.
4cf753c1-099a-4c1c-b90e-7105ca19f650|Kevin adopted me when I was three.
27d7dfc0-6a8d-4dce-aae8-ebbbffdd2b83|Are you suggesting we adopt the child?
ead12ca6-87f5-4ec7-b678-8d29dfbe1247|I can't adopt a baby with you, Barney.
ce571336-012b-4902-8d06-c5ece047ed7b|You never told him he was adopted!
e39de69f-2e4c-4f26-8e75-82a48809cbf3|You will not leave my sight.
c6ea20bb-03c8-4ea2-9389-cf9c93e34eda|What's name of your love at first sight ?
f26f1a8c-a6fd-4631-8110-f1c12807d0e3|And now it's almost within sight- the new world.
2126137b-6c5f-4c08-9cfe-ceaa0a51d0c8|Better get started, looks like a storm.
f7c57709-e596-4deb-8eca-a3e91b2a0180|We call it a perfect storm.
24a6c029-84ed-43d7-a7ed-bfadf422c57b|He wouldn't try to come back in this storm.
5c4132a3-86ba-4bdd-85b0-0f78102babf2|She's been here half of the night.
56505e4d-152c-4bb5-afb3-7255c45ffebc|I'll make it less gay by half.
15037214-2ff5-4e10-bb77-d5bd846d4912|In an hour and a half in your room.
610186c8-312f-464f-930c-2878fc45380d|At this stage, I'm just making an assessment.
5c4aba75-2d66-4164-bc5b-d78f265be584|Your assessment will be held the day after tomorrow.
453e8a5c-b0e4-41ef-965a-915c3c56a5d9|Let's keep our assessments to ourselves.
d55850bb-48da-4622-86ee-4411dec9f2e3|This isn't just about the weather, Walter.
fa1917ca-087b-4559-8aaa-54497a1ee2bd|You can't count on the weather.
c097124e-df10-415b-8c26-60d400d531ac|Oh, what, now you're the weather lady.
b76f7f21-8821-4394-8054-2ccb84d6fa8c|Max, do you still have that pocket knife?
dfe52216-2bb7-4f2d-93b1-d7b99ad5d11f|I give him some pocket money.
80a55a03-3d2a-40c0-b6c4-75101e28a466|Is that a bird in his pocket?
cca348f1-1da6-4ad9-984d-e5936426b58a|It's right here in my pocket.
df19436e-ae37-4dcd-85ae-cd5bd8ae40f2|Put that in your pocket.
95e22d2d-05a1-496c-8baa-dbc75b2445df|I got to him through an aid worker.
4f5187f3-0c53-40c0-9289-3b4666570a80|I ask that we aid each other.
ea413419-09d6-4ab0-94b3-8a567fcfb5cb|Well, If I can be of aid, I will.
d3643aca-978d-45cb-802d-74d63b747a87|The man with the hearing aid like Charles?
f6dcfecd-2e8c-40b9-a61f-9efe6ad32600|At least they're still working on aids.
9c04d765-1ace-487a-8649-189844c2a151|I brought you some reading, too.
2e20a3b8-18ef-4bc7-beba-398b37f240aa|Why don't you continue with the reading?
f1173a77-4f55-432e-9872-e33ead86fe76|Were we at the same reading?
811dea09-a1ae-495d-8264-28e3042c1d43|I ain't much for book reading, sir.
5cf6ec8a-2f29-40b4-958f-c3659d9fe535|Oh, you think it sounds thin.
a7329728-f963-4478-95f0-8816e5affea1|They tend to be long and thin.
220c0c2b-f385-4974-afea-9f53c42514f6|We're spread thin as it is.
4b5bb507-482e-476f-92bf-192a991ec8ad|He was hit by something short and thin.
34c2764b-6ceb-4aa3-a86a-3102c1c7e972|And you're thin for someone who likes food.
b4b335f2-ca03-4068-b7e3-4144569b0679|And I can't seem to interest a soul.
720846aa-b204-4bc2-9d67-6dc428996710|I'm trying to save America's soul!
d956f1ae-0cd3-41d4-8688-5beafaa43239|I didn't say soul food.
5b1aa63c-ec62-4ce5-859d-46bf178089a2|He thinks they steal a person's soul.
e954c03b-98a4-4caa-9f9b-77b774b958ea|It doesn't seem strange to you ?
fe533c48-1f77-44e7-8806-d706bb2e61a2|I agree that is strange.
687f132b-a0bb-4457-acea-703220453110|So perhaps it is not really so strange.
bcc1c4dd-fe1d-41d1-a461-62611df0bffd|Not the ones you build out of strange pieces.
d8b9531f-207b-4e94-8b86-69db65689e26|We're married and have kids, there's a system, see.
2ed9455a-cda6-43aa-9511-c97f383511e2|They said they'd just gotten married, right?
bc96f779-e5e9-42a5-a000-d5d6f123161e|I fell in love with a married man.
36c4293a-7034-4081-9aa5-c2eb69dce5ec|And bear in mind, Ethan is a married man.
18ff1069-8361-49e6-8a1d-84878bb6ca16|I have to start getting organized.
07883151-6044-49de-955b-a64b92810ab0|We need to clean house first, organize the country.
38d9353e-43de-4fbd-bc50-26e5934c6daa|We have to organize the people down here.
89a45bb2-64c5-48ad-8bde-e836186f00a4|And you organized it perfectly!
e04cd094-eeef-4dd8-98eb-295dff8ee7f2|You all just jumped to the wrong conclusion.
69df7d70-4f07-4ccb-9765-221a392b2adf|We've burned through too much fuel.
200f00ee-2e28-4bcb-925e-dd53d8d25f00|A whole fuel tank has dropped off.
ec8848c3-bb08-4592-99df-ccaa61a676fe|That'll burn a lot of fuel, sir.
6c2c21b6-7389-47ee-bb24-b197ae60e739|What's it like being an urban hero?
36c3ac69-a113-4841-9e44-01b2f756b33a|We also have the urban cities, right?
a2541980-2658-4f4d-8a0f-9a71c01fcca0|None of this stuff belongs to us.
3a197d95-8c72-4283-8a1d-8a4fd15a7f01|You guys don't belong in here, man.
2f3a2d82-e4a8-4f7a-b8a5-68a2e5c0603f|They belong here more than we.
5f0207f0-99b5-4c4a-9810-5280cafbde44|He's back where he belongs.
5f81862b-8c2b-44ea-8778-bea286af4687|Debts he claimed that now belonged to me.
34bc93b3-df54-4afa-853c-7045437de690|Oh, Phil, you're getting salt all over me.
ff6e21dd-6b8d-4af2-867e-b2c78b4ac838|Ever worked in a salt mine?
78260e6e-51d9-4558-bc47-96014737e219|I tried pouring some salt down there.
5ce4c766-ace0-46ea-b1c1-b103e51fdc3c|You are concerned about crossing the salt water.
0146949d-c815-4bd3-9c78-f4dc8298c8df|And by your sugar farmers, you mean big sugar?
4ade82f6-2693-4054-a2a1-fdbb1e9435e3|I'll be a farmer for life.
ed49aef3-f70c-4546-8f56-51cf9621bcf4|Those who do not wish to be farmers.
2e5268ce-2ba6-44d5-afd6-6b3304293a1b|You also said not to leave straight away.
5208a399-722c-45ea-a687-9a98fd660d4f|Okay, just give it to me straight.
73f553ba-1710-4241-b4ba-110e4e3052ea|His face wouldn't be straight.
ece33774-a02b-4ffb-8107-8c6b0cccbf10|Oh, must you run off straight away?
4570d749-457d-4a61-8ed6-2cd427cb5952|And you're really straight now?
06820466-03f8-4eec-a9ef-fa2d7c607363|If she is, take my advice, run.
aec7b55a-6a61-4616-9ab1-5700a7dd3fd8|Well, can't we just ask her advice?
864e4beb-4190-4e68-ae94-e241fc2243ca|You always give the best advice!
39861f6c-14be-4f5f-82b4-d12525afb8fc|To ask for my advice about your wife?
346e9939-ee91-4376-8280-8c1db34c64b0|Maybe they have some advice.
aa4f2c83-d6dc-4584-a33e-8213c845ccdc|I cannot be under the covers with you anymore.
60835f12-c93e-41a6-a0de-5286601bf588|No, no, no, I know all about covers.
ece21e68-1775-4c04-be98-6a3e089f7ba8|Could you pull my covers up?
9cef54e0-a541-4532-a6d7-42995966238f|Checking crime reports, reading up on our covers.
6d78f34e-1e5a-4577-b647-f92be04eadbe|You created all those covers.
547ab601-d11b-4e04-938d-645212fe3c6e|Either way, could affect his balance.
d4ca7304-5081-43f3-accf-b50d7df6a93a|For you to confirm the dates and balances.
c1d524d6-4ee3-4f0d-84a6-bbce7d16e580|Taking it would balance nothing.
e287fd55-b709-41e3-b23b-32b72050e6c9|The news does not balance my cause.
89263ad2-092a-4e62-bd2b-e6d0bd3011ff|I'm always just trying to balance work and family.
0e980e25-af6e-4bb1-96ff-2d39b88f21fa|The temperature will drop after dark.
3469c378-92a9-4769-b2c2-ec344786fa7c|How do I control the temperature in here.
68334259-dce3-4d6f-8b32-678366b9133c|We're trying to keep your temperature down.
150dd6af-b391-47e8-a194-3d1b042bfbd1|And meant that the house was empty.
9a8e431d-97ce-4a4f-89a7-8172896f1503|And kept crying until I felt empty.
c3bb8fba-1e1d-46e9-8fa3-04e12788fc87|What if we went to an empty parking lot?
43178c3d-9308-4225-9b84-3010fc6b07b3|The room was empty when I got here.
09667e68-868a-42c5-8321-450fe9766ca0|But the story will conclude as they all do.
6137e950-f901-4144-98fc-e11ae4ffda0d|Whatever she's planning, it has to involve Charlotte somehow.
6ab8ac3c-5130-4f87-892f-feb66ea0a5ef|Well, maybe you let it slip somehow.
56c3c692-02db-4fff-89fe-f6306e84f528|Somehow fixing other people seems to fix yourself.
c96d8ff1-aa5f-46e3-a094-2dead2c5979c|What, that she somehow led you on?
5c59a52f-83cb-40ac-b973-d8ccc7477345|Well, you were right about Brooklyn Without Limits.
d5ee77cd-cd63-44c9-be99-883dfec86f23|Why don't we make it no limit?
3508e398-5319-41ca-aab6-cae394cc3349|There are limits to what we can do.
83fccf23-7540-4722-93b5-0f04059c623e|I'm at my limit, so that's it.
dda329f4-2a50-4665-9caf-4e43e26531bd|You are looking at a prime customer, everybody.
dcd52d13-a3df-4a22-8c1a-39980adc696a|At least you had a prime!
45dc2c21-f654-421f-b148-df99659c668e|He was some horse in his prime!
0522f273-0564-4474-bf41-5ba70088ec23|That makes him our prime suspect.
1936b974-4e7f-4e89-bbfc-e38531297f61|You know, he was the prime minister of England.
09e8d254-9166-423e-b874-66f6334456f0|This place smells like a breast.
adf2e427-1c74-43f9-bddf-20507f2c1cbc|My breasts are real too.
4eea411d-60b0-44e8-aa80-07f1dbc29685|Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.
ae197d44-841c-45d3-928e-3105495d8635|My wife died of breast cancer last year.
b32a6b5c-db51-40cf-9953-83fa91969083|I left a proposal on my desk at work.
57540cd4-6407-4562-8472-270edd3c579a|Bill hates sitting behind a desk.
c3bf2006-e26a-4aaf-b4c2-c46a6b06eb06|I won't let anyone take your desk.
b3642e09-4e4b-4f13-aa87-947cd0a4f697|I still have one in my desk.
5119d1c6-d8a5-4b3f-8a73-bdf809e08f92|Yeah, I'm recording something right now.
cb46a3d3-f6ad-47ca-b50a-982fd7bdcf98|Just make sure you record it.
fb027a03-b379-4f86-aeff-9b2c1b84e17d|I'm out of breath already after hardly an hour.
451e51fb-a977-447e-aa07-c0eb4b32214b|I'll give you a second to catch your breath.
28396e4c-d207-4837-affb-ba43ff0f1310|Now the rest of you, take a breath.
0802b606-d170-4f61-9188-bccd48dfad1d|You held your breath for a moment.
b60634c2-369b-4633-abfd-e1168ea0b394|I couldn't stand his hot coffee breath.
78029d5b-7687-4ec4-9535-73fce410353e|Last I played theater was in school.
51664340-d1b8-4f37-a1c5-72da8490daf2|I do like theater, but you didn't ask.
8ba1212d-4e38-4617-9543-3c0c87a3d81f|And that theater it made my cold worse.
3b72cd1a-48d2-4a7e-9fbf-a1fbe0efc742|I wish every woman would acknowledge that.
59e27ac3-4359-450a-a5c4-3174d86b2acb|All you wanted was for him to acknowledge you.
8493f293-eebd-486b-8d3d-d8f7feb3c1d1|I acknowledge that I do not like this style.
8daa1964-4fda-4d83-8aeb-cb2ed82b3fe8|I acknowledge we know less than we thought.
15287821-a610-42f5-ac13-4a8e3c37811b|You could at least acknowledge I exist.
926bf20e-47df-46bd-948b-e4ff8d25295e|Fly back to take away theme home.
f9c686b2-f66e-457b-ae9e-544f9894a0e1|Does he know it's your theme song?
1e648a6b-a733-47c5-a243-2588ea27e0e0|No, no, no, we need a theme.
fce301e8-2eaf-4f30-9078-e4e6ab77e3fe|Our theme for tonight, yes?
cc3227f0-3182-47c5-b6cb-85216a0b09fd|On this person, the fat comes up as black.
876a017f-b05b-4e40-b83e-42a3160a6ad3|I know that I have upper knee fat.
c2855594-f791-4448-9d6f-0bb81a546db6|Take a look at his body fat.
668d2683-89e0-4485-9b91-40c406539ec2|Put your money where your fat blue mouth is.
18649c7e-85f5-42fd-8580-cfaf7b7e5ce8|What can't wait, you or the software?
e0b223d0-031b-4841-8408-3e41f509f064|I don't know the credit union's software well enough.
cdf18cf3-a62c-40e6-a3fd-f67a625d4850|You know, that's my software.
e27df163-53b6-407e-bf7f-d0ce58ad42d0|But you yourself admit the software will learn.
d1b7d0cb-ed4d-48aa-a7d5-592a38a37bba|I should probably pop it with a little sugar.
e85697c7-bb03-48d4-8b46-7513c1860b09|Let me guess, you take it with sugar?
61f8d2bb-3853-405e-a03b-75ef360fab61|Put some sugar on for your brother.
ac84811a-e62e-47f0-87f5-ca93fb0335fa|I don't have any sugar either.
ee0859bf-59d6-4f63-8f65-5b2393bb5a59|It spent me two thousand and something.
ba7ddc3e-7c30-4a13-9032-eb65908df2f6|Which makes things about a thousand times worse.
cc4cc7c8-e064-4c23-b657-78fe18a89a87|That could be any one of a thousand cars.
712f01fa-4a29-4633-9faf-e17aac6e8d10|He breaks codes that can't be broken.
9fa74555-7b88-4ab0-b88a-1dbbb434d568|We've changed all our codes.
83f932c2-c61e-4209-a9cd-8e09d27ae42b|Look at the time code, it's July.
63fbf6c6-0379-43b1-a9bd-3953885898f6|That's why everyone here fears me.
be2f2d20-b9a9-4505-b155-38284f380795|In jail, they fear that.
860b5a0d-7576-417d-a41d-4638b516bc9f|I fear that I, too, am finished.
e128dc90-376b-4975-8e7d-63866e433a93|I fear you've been waiting for me.
c00e5098-0846-43a0-af85-229703690d54|I'm sure these numbers are connected somehow.
ae99e83a-787b-4a4d-aee4-587c0eae537b|I've never been able to connect with him.
51478a27-1071-4abc-b00a-627a29f7d059|I'm seeing four legs connected to one body.
3ec86d4f-e3f4-4fa9-a960-2e3ddf9794de|We were connected, I wasn't thinking about anything.
fb6ed03f-4eba-40c1-98e0-16c2eead11ce|The white thing with yellow eyes is real.
698877e6-c0c8-4f21-9fc5-7d4909531094|Matt loves me in yellow!
fd337b7a-0e91-424c-a180-102590400475|And he ran over in his yellow shirt.
3f2820e0-0108-485c-b2a0-622c80017d0f|Yes, she looks pretty yellow.
2d5e7133-df72-4e53-8ff9-f4715fdda3bc|Japanese woman will be proud of you.
cf4b1006-4aa5-4475-8eb3-56bc679d9461|The Japanese are on their knees.
14e6df50-e6d0-4e23-b5c6-70b3dfdd26ef|Like, I don't know, about Japanese people.
18bd240c-97c9-4eab-995f-e7df298b65dd|He might already recognize us from the panel.
19b5c3c2-6c56-4fb8-a971-acd3a0a3a115|I think we'll just start with a blood panel.
437db704-b835-460b-9e87-be2e6c2b5664|Well, you put her on the panel.
02765f82-15f4-49b1-9a2e-300223e0e17d|Let me show you our library.
0c36e31e-5c63-485e-81a2-3811f32a43e9|We went to the library to read stories.
78732381-aaa7-4b1e-ac4b-6eec3541db6b|Remember I told you that the library burned down?
9a363b59-a236-4093-a2ae-76987975981d|Max, I don't care how expensive it is.
11388829-e099-4cd9-a8a7-8b956b95cfe2|That's only the most expensive part of doing anything!
f6f57f51-886b-416b-870c-874e917d0091|Everything's so expensive these days.
bfe847d6-a62c-4a27-844b-4b3c6841f172|Do you have any idea how expensive insurance is?
9cfd3fb5-2227-4647-b926-f2dfaf60a472|That makes it expensive, but kids love it.
d5ea5062-1457-4fc0-b640-5da0b2867145|It isn't time to be weak and emotional.
d768a200-c320-40d6-9004-7c5a8fbeb002|Don't get emotional, don't get angry.
6a19239f-cafc-4428-85b2-a354ea802548|Every time you talk, I get more emotional.
092f6147-9dd7-451c-b951-07612757cd65|We both have strong emotional ties to our houses.
d51cb8a5-29bf-4426-9475-01b58c039bad|Okay, Tina, you're too emotional.
ce3d6484-40c1-4207-87ec-d4b0903ea595|We're having some engine problems.
7b7b13f4-9ce6-4009-a3c4-dd0948c29f89|Well, they can't be far, the engine's still warm.
d0351247-7ea0-4722-a0b4-1bc9c16f1d65|One's got no engine, and one's got no wheels.
01ea424d-78bd-4e45-a62c-5560ad45f438|Just getting him down to the engine room.
e4cc75e4-7eb3-4e61-9f48-dbd0cee771f8|Perhaps we could propose a trade.
3aa4e9e7-c86c-4a7c-8702-28bac761a974|I thought you were proposing to me.
320c7fb9-3c6b-4416-b840-21e38584baf0|And what are you proposing that might be?
45cfc9fc-d76b-440b-a704-a94b03ec7531|Would he have proposed then?
f42acb5d-4356-4ced-83e0-40ec54a9a65b|And yet, to date, no record of mental illness?
48d41ade-6506-4cd4-a9e7-a4d7cecbf309|I just took a couple mental health days.
a58e295b-69d5-4725-aded-5c911b50d173|Is there any record of mental illness?
9f0ea37f-ef34-44b8-a652-40d5d804fd6a|Just want to get a mental picture.
f1994753-fd3b-497a-a9c0-5abefbb94e69|Jane, I think you need help mental help.
4d43d838-d9fb-4f8b-b933-83a940c228ca|Your friend is facing a difficulty.
04a58722-835f-4ef0-81d5-12c00524757d|My family had difficulty getting money for my studies.
ae9529d4-d584-4083-a58a-003734afbe4d|You might wish you'd gotten on that train, too.
01dcee3d-2272-4bfa-b833-7a9254df335a|I wonder what he was doing on that train?
811dc80b-bf7b-48ed-af94-2da192ca1b80|Or you'd never have let us on the train!
bec1235a-4d64-40dd-9ee7-1c70889a09c8|Oh, well, you'll love seeing this country by train.
0766e0ee-7fdd-4087-baac-1900a4eea5f4|You stay away from the brown stuff.
c73d89e4-4ffe-4730-abb4-067a02edc733|I am back, and she is going to brown.
c83405fd-1365-4761-9b08-7ff126da2096|I like them when they're old and brown.
b8eb82a2-d0f8-4fc4-99bf-e1f6d018f2cb|I think brown and gray would be better.
44b202d6-23bc-4053-b50b-a764d9eb758f|You have a brown spot on your shoulder.
d6aa7897-577b-40f3-afa5-8255f10c9467|Basically, I take meetings and read contracts.
9e839284-e5c7-4fb5-81b5-7c03c53412c7|Basically, you're saying that this couldn't have happened.
7850d840-8042-4d65-98c9-5016e17c9592|It's a week, isn't it, basically, give or take?
9d2b91c4-21bb-49a6-9fb3-8c18810eafd8|I mean, you're basically in love with him.
3b641a00-53e7-4b93-abb9-ef95b79ed5b5|Tess, he may not last the night.
649199d9-2196-4e9a-acd3-e7dff770deca|You lasted a lot longer than I expected.
77794db1-d81c-4b70-8eba-0dc6ba9fecd3|I can't last like this!
00ff5f78-bb73-4889-bcc4-93f706b36abd|On Monday, when did you see me last?
bf8100eb-0f33-4053-8138-c969eee914d8|I thought it would last forever.
90cd4420-d6b5-4399-aec9-3f604b305f1f|You wore that when we last went out.
cc1e3af1-6e65-4985-9189-66d98c57169f|I was really young when I last saw him.
b37709fe-aed1-431b-91ae-43905e1fec85|It's the cop who almost caught us last night.
156af820-144b-4c57-8eb2-34f474acd9ee|I don't think I'll last here.
4deae4e2-9046-41db-a91d-7375b394ab08|On average, he sells one car every other day.
2787a04c-3476-4a6c-aaf2-db32a2db32af|Your firm's returns doubled the market averages last year.
f35a418a-d6a5-40f7-a212-bacaaa718325|That is a bit above average.
b2c1cf18-2f77-48b7-8d56-039a0e2fbd53|You may reduce your average.
8952a2eb-633f-4923-94ae-ec9c3fbbc500|Does she have a ring like that?
6486fea0-d7e1-4b9a-a272-4e1ebc88a75f|It was after he told me about his ring.
57ae9a1c-cc1a-4dbe-bc27-d68b0a9d157e|So, what's with the ring, Jamie?
1c0add48-536c-4b5d-a7a2-7c52132279bd|They marked all the Christian houses.
e51d438e-9887-4057-aab4-6ca0b3f71a39|John is marked to hang this morning.
3cd1076e-8738-4c8d-add0-8ea34ed4b3b8|This boy is marked for life.
728da09e-ff1c-49a1-a256-fd78193f9346|You're always marking papers, always on a schedule!
ffac4e08-487e-4d95-8fbf-164c90bbafaa|See if you can locate those missing girls.
6ca319d7-7f83-4cd3-9b6b-d5b5b5c1b390|Here, let me locate it for you.
15317b8d-2514-4ef4-8a48-dbf8bd04607c|We'll try to locate them if they get captured.
e9ab055e-022b-4934-801c-5854a7484312|We need to locate that crime scene.
18e669eb-385d-44eb-b9e1-2de67e7ef606|Maybe we should go search for them.
23169c65-dfe7-4d86-a23f-adfd31ceb5e7|With your help, we can begin the search immediately.
bd3d3aa5-8545-42a2-ad2a-074a12b1d737|You know, we did some computer searches.
eb84b2d5-744d-4b25-98ea-3d7877ac2e33|That world is largely gone now.
9c411c66-062a-4382-b64f-ae3249238ed5|Largely so other people don't have to.
7d2310f0-0194-40c5-8554-94bb392f15e1|Your son is largely unknown outside of New York.
c27d6b0f-f317-4ff8-ac03-f157cd655b28|The phones are largely stolen from women.
8a310114-535c-4c14-97a2-f5201e3cf3a5|Oh, can this possibly get any worse?
36510ef3-ded5-4088-aef5-ffebb89201cd|How can we possibly do this again?
96a22f55-ea0a-4ea2-a04e-27057498b62e|With respect, how can you possibly know that?
99a4710f-54e7-4da0-860c-5670df88c875|That can't possibly be a real person.
96cbadd5-5610-47e1-9971-78a9157ff795|How can this possibly still be going on?
615c902a-9171-4206-a44d-04e5799ae23b|You don't come around to our house anymore.
985e381a-39dc-4218-ac70-0bdfc4c15102|You don't have to carry me anymore.
686111c1-4297-4ea2-bc42-af3015c703fc|I don't want any part of it anymore.
e7cdcf38-1d84-4466-a358-1fcff7e9e19a|They don't make them like that anymore.
52a8d324-bd9d-4bb4-a020-52715a069489|Computers generate them, big computers.
27c73ad5-6f38-4bb4-9f22-a199df7a28d3|But what could it generate?
98cc4e4f-dd4e-40fc-9f71-ee98042f5d28|The human brain doesn't generate enough energy.
1888b948-bd41-49bf-83bc-38efa4889b41|Oh, it was kind of a regional tragedy.
1d278e9d-b1da-4c49-b7dc-c4a64fae84af|Oh, I thought they'd send someone from regional.
e7cc5149-07b9-41a3-a5d1-dc8b3b02891e|Police, regional council, government records on all five.
e87a05d0-e026-45cb-a348-a45952c5fddd|She was her company's top regional manager.
0cb7d4d5-8c6c-4159-9f31-6e26342b52d4|Well, no obvious problems that I can find.
129aaad6-52ad-439e-b13a-f7498f98e8b8|Because it is obvious what she's after.
bf0bb02b-2d3d-417e-891c-745f943e55cc|Everyone has an angry dad, even me.
38de9d16-08c4-43b9-8c26-b3edf46ebe10|My father was angry about that.
90dfef17-aae2-45c2-b959-16cd4f04003a|And not at you or anyone, I'm just angry.
07adb2ec-cd32-48fa-9dbf-f807645f5f66|I told him and he got angry.
e20ffe49-1c2f-474d-84f2-4c435e14313d|My analyst couldn't stop mentioning it.
adc2b2be-ece0-4f58-954a-6bfc1c833d94|Oh, you are a better analyst than I thought.
a3f7c299-0ef4-4eeb-8af2-0e0eb2feb520|Analysts, you have five minutes to track your target.
b1bfed52-d13a-46f3-ad4f-32e63c286c09|I was there - and you caused the accident!
4a7e5be2-1da6-4249-9f75-46a7a4af62d5|They say that there are no accidents.
5b305e1b-1b66-4dcc-8d77-5c5bcb24e758|What happened to your father was an accident!
2dfeb319-267b-4826-9d7b-ad76b875693a|She started to remember details of the accident.
bbfc05bc-d6cb-4ce5-a399-c83216f857d3|But her death was definitely not an accident.
80a40f8a-d569-4821-8950-0c11ff4a27ef|I'm doing my best to continue the trend.
990ecd18-36f3-4285-a273-aeecd24ac923|You should stop that before it trends.
69cdc795-72db-4078-9523-51cd9af89287|I will see the trends the models don't.
5b21d3d0-11f6-46d8-a6e2-93dfb4b23fd7|She, like, runs every day.
0948e000-0a29-4493-9ef4-eaad59e3b60c|Never liked science or big words.
1a303647-d6a9-4b36-8961-49124ffdefbc|You drink tea like water.
9688f29e-7dcb-4342-9ebc-96ac971e528b|This isn't what it looks like, boss.
b4c17265-881f-4429-96fe-976e8ec5b7b4|She even did some personal appearances here.
812fde41-7e7f-4280-ac82-3dbc9d443f33|That was just keeping up appearances, wasn't it?
56e34e9b-f756-47c2-8db1-91f24f598d98|You should definitely make an appearance.
f3c33a87-ebbd-4757-9690-4ab96112f8f1|Only clean clothes I currently own.
e3c4fdfe-1066-450c-9d43-5b1fa38f5ec7|I don't have it currently here with me.
16847bcd-c8b2-4594-b1e5-f090e81ef2d3|But this country is currently in its difficult situation.
3efc5fa0-1218-41cb-bd2c-6725b72521e8|The rights you own, currently being a soldier.
91442c18-5682-44c3-a423-51cabd3f02f7|Maybe you didn't even kill his shadow!
3e010c4c-e46d-466b-a213-27d59a69791b|I've counted it, one shadow.
0cd98fac-f820-4582-aaec-3bd92a247db1|But the shadows are part of nature, too.
a86e97ca-c9fa-4860-b518-f3d455586b50|I don't need a government shadow.
73cf1ace-f52e-45c9-8176-2c0ac81df46b|# Then we'll come from the shadows.
8c4bbdaa-3f1a-4eda-91de-19616a94ad0e|She does not realize that Human beings are warm.
5f31ecd7-53b3-4af4-84a3-2af56f5f32c0|We stole human beings for our purpose.
09d5ff1d-e0a6-4ec2-aacf-665a1a89d952|These are all things human beings do!
dfd67611-3009-4b02-a7ab-a55a93facf7a|Probably still thinking of themselves as human beings.
640e65e1-a7ae-445a-9085-1a8465939faf|But I've met a lot of human beings.
cb18fd7d-17d7-4ddb-b161-5f14d076828c|So much for needing a full moon.
0907d1c1-32dd-4355-939f-76d5c77f3ca0|There won't be a moon tonight.
a121f2a9-49cc-4bac-93c1-65fdd95058a5|We can look at the moon.
3f421c3a-9b74-4e9a-8849-0e623140999e|It's water under the bridge, man.
03231b14-c064-4105-9e03-9cea0a4565ca|The boat must have just passed under this bridge.
8787d389-3f91-43c1-bba9-512f97d7e784|It is if you like bridge.
9626dd51-01e3-4f85-a958-3a646725f96f|Well, I recommend that you all practice sports.
1cbc8ebe-c3d7-4f8e-bf9b-7093535dd51c|Guess the kid's got something to recommend him.
8686bdd1-63e3-4358-873e-5259629c05df|Then how do you know what to recommend?
a12e6dfd-f949-4e65-a0b1-110a612d3241|They were just waiting for the hearing.
4ffca001-b643-4a0c-9867-feebcb16a1e1|Because this is the first I'm hearing of it.
adf5028b-6a35-45b3-baa1-cd5a81670ebb|No, there is a very important court hearing.
80c25b9e-fe30-4e53-b9fb-2a1d68b7d0fa|We'll see you at the hearing.
8c44263f-0a00-4f9b-a4e0-2f6c2efb24db|They're gonna throw fruit at us.
f18a55e1-5426-44b1-8306-f03977613ef2|You've got your bowls of fruit.
f451f51c-51bb-473a-907b-89a83b7da6ac|I won't lunch with that fruit!
9635655f-d90c-4b9d-8d90-1d8203759ae1|Shut up and take the fruit.
d8301b26-feed-4de3-b7ba-64aff2a5a197|Sir, there's a lot of fruit here.
f0ee7845-125c-4d34-b2c5-771ed061f5c8|You're on the dance floor, see?
8fc18816-8dbf-4d69-925b-f20d09d42fdb|Says the man dancing with me tonight.
fa8506d5-de4c-4098-a100-6499d878bbc1|Oh no, cannot go to a high school dance!
d532116e-cef4-46ac-b89d-1a22ee679fb8|You should say something about the dance, perhaps.
1f5e5a9f-60b7-4684-9910-501e3ac27614|Well, you can start by dancing with me.
7dc74707-03cb-4187-af67-927e9285cb66|No, no, you're just shifting your eyes like this.
b11ad78f-d157-463f-9d11-c77d10f86866|This has gone far beyond just shifting Smith around!
87fae6fc-e22e-4abd-a45a-af66bc4c4087|Yeah, but let's just say, public opinion has shifted.
a271eb74-f172-473e-b3b4-c1fa69b2ecb5|Could someone shift it before we go again?
14c70285-1ec7-4a72-9551-cab283b5b43c|I am still struggling with my injury.
89cb967f-6694-421a-b679-e8e7d2b9b1af|It's everything we've been struggling to get away from.
070d41cf-9236-4afb-b1c4-5a8415208aef|And I was struggling to feed myself and Louis.
9864cc37-883c-4c0e-ba91-a63ebf9e5357|He is struggling for air.
711b5ba4-f6ab-4342-b120-02ba0ea881fa|How's that revenue stream running ?
0095fcc1-94a9-4e9f-b341-985fc158887d|We will enter into a revenue share agreement.
90070d20-d390-41b3-a0fe-3b668bd84562|Opening the park will bring in vital revenue.
d2c6e2d0-7a89-4e0d-809c-28a89f1be827|He also gave us a new revenue source.
be087021-b186-4166-ac81-e07997845ae4|I will get these to the Revenue office.
9c2ad2c9-5210-4892-a368-925276418892|Where the hell did you get that notion?
71f01b7f-210c-488a-87a4-5de5ff4725b5|I'm sure we're none of his notion.
895bc2fc-36dc-4c78-b736-558e080527eb|Looks like things worked out okay.
4ff3989d-ecf3-4e43-9f35-1a6e2cd3b2d0|But he's okay in my book.
3565a329-e2b2-496d-8fda-60529e42761f|You okay after last night?
36eed942-a7a6-4813-863d-4b0e325d63b0|They were the ones who shot my friend, okay?
7f74cbec-7c5e-48cc-82a6-cf791bcb2375|It's okay, she told me.
492d6d64-80e5-44e4-86db-5dbb97deac1d|Okay, look, we've got to move it.
d73a3d97-70ce-4120-87a9-243aa5229d31|Okay, well, let me know when you talk.
5dca282f-8ff2-4b49-9d21-ccb11f778d5e|Okay, that won't help us win the case.
8eb4e29e-5833-45fb-a5ee-2191562e801f|Okay, but we do know who killed her.
4d84438c-762e-47ab-9d4f-63cbd4ae2a2a|Okay, the first one was like this.
d0d4fb6a-d545-49c8-ac44-4501420b0bf6|Maybe the rest of the package wasn't drugs.
fa665286-2585-457e-a9bc-3daa432cf001|Can you get the package today?
ae3fdca1-b44d-4bd9-90b1-dba9442b4487|You left me that package, didn't you?
6f4f2f58-7748-4349-98af-68cb54270a8b|She started working in packaging two months ago.
15d5ea8d-e26c-4c77-a105-55e1fa09d8bb|We ought to throw you in a cell.
94122503-d062-4041-89fd-748bc425a719|I ought to take this one off as well.
f2c52c20-e419-4da3-b48f-e1e0f8433395|Yeah, they said traffic was terrible coming back.
f0523d65-2cca-4a07-a032-ba0f3b9f6166|Animals, music and traffic noise.
82f99575-e900-4eb7-8353-2ae7c8edf691|Yes, all local police radio traffic.
f85d742b-4cb4-4056-a94d-a3b846bf5bd6|Harry, I'm just stuck in traffic.
85688724-6dff-411a-9856-888dafc4800d|You could have internal injuries or breaks.
bcaf3090-0a4b-4e22-bf12-79e56bf157c8|I would guess, some pretty massive internal injuries.
498cd654-da44-49fc-8e58-b26d191f1c85|What's the code for internal security?
ce64d2f9-2552-43ea-abd2-2d377703625e|Or do you prefer Steven?
6b0e5478-95ad-46d7-982e-2c81227a29ba|I prefer my wife to answer.
d930825d-4b6b-4b55-8d5a-8fbcd0160ed6|Come to think of it, she prefers black.
89ec03db-a5d3-46bf-8928-1bf0c9c3f828|I preferred you when you were drinking.
4c6c5385-845d-4cdb-93eb-0cf42b0e0115|He was the fourth member of our crew.
a50f6ed7-b870-462d-b674-c86a75b0ac2a|All crew members are to arm themselves.
3e118302-6611-446a-997d-a9257b31c931|I'd like to follow them with my crew.
005496f4-7b88-429c-b72c-6f478d548391|We won't know until we search the room first.
3af980d7-ee18-446d-9863-5578126434c7|We've been searching for her since.
e508540e-b9a2-4b94-997c-2b717abb264d|And while you're at it, search your own.
c4370c8a-11ab-49e8-8f98-2626370762a2|We need to search his car and his houses.
1df0e1a5-e4b7-41de-8a92-5b6d2648bacf|No, we didn't make any great profits.
da96edbc-7a2e-4d92-9ef0-201de67a65b3|I thought I could get ten times more profit.
8d571770-04c3-4bd8-aea3-e21294ff860c|Your recent profit rate is great.
0ea3ffd4-078f-4b9a-88ca-ccbfff622a7a|Well, I have to make a profit.
3eb7d8ab-e128-4014-bbc0-5f66ce6d2143|All the cases must be linked in some way.
b6342087-e0ad-4150-8d9f-98b4140fe5d7|I mean, the devices must be linked somehow.
acc2d435-fe3c-42b0-9b79-daf57e3508fd|The cops don't care if it's linked.
cfd30cea-27a8-4d89-afb7-bc51d3d3d6a9|You'll never be bothered by all that thinking again.
7f75d8bd-4c38-4f38-8150-eba115ee2d90|And what was that girl thinking?
7e80de53-12d5-4dbe-84ad-388f31af40ea|Just relax and try thinking of nothing.
bcc513a5-f663-4db8-8eed-255f3e7e458a|I know what you're all thinking.
1e05bed4-18a3-4b24-bf0b-124bb89bcd1b|What is your brother thinking?
7f534374-9727-447f-9ce3-7b73a9404834|That hardly seems right, does it?
ec316a53-5f02-48e6-bfc8-9ca052cf0b22|You can hardly sit up.
90fa23d3-1688-426b-af8a-a3241da2556d|I hardly know him, in fact.
e0110c6d-6649-4e4b-8147-304f95aecef9|I mean, it's hardly a business now.
4b8bdb10-65be-4944-a4e7-059b5ff51974|The place where we'd arrived was near an airport.
96da5cc6-02f8-4b83-adb8-47c48ad30851|She saw me at the airport.
e41fc6c3-9cc8-4679-964c-d5012a0cb67f|We work so hard to make humans trust us.
f407532b-6401-4056-a116-1b1a9a34f463|Only humans can pass through.
9536d0fc-98b1-44f1-8bd5-83b9639ea37d|Think about it, humans at lunch.
477262dc-33ef-42b8-a12f-b9a110495c5e|But the humans might call that lucky.
04550698-16f9-4109-87f9-1ad74a11e078|All this stuff is extremely common.
3c31a5b4-de62-4edf-a46c-cf79f8f3eded|The situation we find ourselves in is extremely serious.
ce42d246-b4ac-41a1-a054-a3923739151c|He and Robert were extremely close.
ebb32fbd-aa55-4bc3-a67f-488b0cc9fb0d|It is extremely hard to explain how this feels.
1310de75-b41c-4ce1-8b4b-905e7aa0e410|Do you ever get sick of this job?
7fb931fb-95b5-4c4f-98a6-06ee4c7566af|She's the worst when she's sick.
fedb0c6a-26c3-4711-9b27-814f92e7a7a6|I think about it, I get sick.
8dfbb8a7-b729-443c-882f-410b506fa486|They're sick of having me around.
553b249c-ded3-48e7-9482-9130da2fa567|That's why I can't capture her look.
4c79e20d-8c4d-4709-9012-0d80cd4cbe0a|We'll be screen- capturing the entire session.
5c037995-8f1e-42af-b5a6-c1e229eed0f2|Just when they're beginning to capture my eyes.
ddadf3fa-c5df-450c-a0c6-07685606949a|I have many enemies, but you're quite unique.
87b8b5b8-1319-4f29-8bd2-a5547c7167d7|That pattern is unique to that stone.
55cdafe4-ae21-4692-9c0b-a37098afcda3|I've always enjoyed my unique place in this world.
ae2a6d49-4dd2-4a54-8441-9640a660013b|I think that's a very unique license plate.
9a091a9a-5521-4165-ade9-9793e0ca67cb|That data is our best hope at actual proof.
6fc62da1-6985-4fd5-8aaa-8ed46b80777f|I don't care if he's an actual angel.
65240228-c6c5-402e-9076-8b904a0d3c4c|And why didn't he see the actual shooting?
142e232f-b135-403e-87aa-4c0017ccebf7|I saw you looking at that boy's chest film.
60f63377-c705-4ddf-883f-ff68c8ade223|Just hold him there and keep his chest up.
63694788-f61c-4288-af49-0fdcc8bdf620|Your heart is beating out of your chest.
8eb39a84-5304-43d2-8a55-8d8faf2b8943|Oh, you're gonna stick out your chest?
bb8a2614-fec9-444c-8dd0-95ccea2e7ca5|At least, he paid for my meals.
dd86ec96-c6ce-42cd-a5d3-bae580aefeb3|Jeez, I was just hoping for a free meal.
74e6ae09-a87c-4d24-a197-dba181e9eda1|This could make a big meal.
299812a2-f857-4f38-bbed-36d018f15649|Anybody who performs, that's the beauty of the show.
4b28b9c4-c0aa-4d1c-9892-4588421bfe2a|Yeah, was that a beauty or what?
f6972bcd-3535-4246-8444-ef01f0ea1585|Well, everyone wants a piece of this little beauty.
30ffba62-b70b-4007-8b63-eb1057dbedba|I heard his wife was a beauty.
82b67d2c-dc2d-4964-b000-49d446a21f32|Had this little beauty in his pocket.
319fcac6-a181-4366-a2cc-5d396c8b27c3|Actually, I've lost it, but not to that extent.
d70fd123-e63e-4cb1-8dbb-58ebf2a95ba3|I already have to some extent, captain.
c55cc569-b795-4dce-8892-89f123ecf071|And if you need to defend yourself, use this.
0ca7935c-0e2d-4629-94c3-132620a66024|You think I'm going to enjoy defending them?
87a91b29-567c-4b34-9b0f-abcacb9f114a|I want to defend my home.
26af9b66-d27e-42b7-b47c-13d289826650|I've never understood why you've always defended her.
eb073dc4-32d9-49ac-8d4f-afda68775bbb|Let's get some food ready to welcome our visitors.
265e9463-670f-4c33-b199-99918f81dfc3|Have you had other visitors?
afad3bda-c9a6-42e7-9024-312d9fdef06e|I told them I don't want any visitors.
0a256e07-6b4d-433d-88a3-f965ebb72c73|He said he'd meet you outside.
cde99508-1ce2-47ea-9a7c-20bb0dcf033d|You're the one who stands outside.
74b5d117-dc59-4278-b3f5-c838b6f1f993|I do like to drink outside at night.
d38c27e9-ae93-4096-9ee0-3457f7955fde|Barbara's still outside, she might be in great danger.
6c271ffe-9cc5-4d23-b97a-07eac9d286ea|I'm never sick when I eat outside.
ef19c06b-125f-4154-a4b7-25c8872dffca|Don't get me wrong, I'm not judging.
621c33d2-f099-4cb2-a1b1-0c56bdb6b741|I wouldn't have judged you.
7d641c6b-b908-4381-83f9-0e76e12f1e95|I guess those are girls, judging by their hair.
09048735-478f-4874-ac82-65f59df7f893|I shouldn't have judged you.
ee422e75-672c-4e26-bfe3-f93848f3022c|I've left you, like, half a dozen messages.
a4a93f9a-f63e-46fa-8d83-eca4d5462cbf|I could show you a good half dozen.
e7b92d6e-368a-4c59-8b19-1850c7e51f6e|That was at least two dozen words.
06c3d58a-9505-46a5-8a36-d514145179b4|I need at least a dozen new men.
28df360e-3a29-4013-9b2d-b535fdfaef77|I told him to declare himself guilty.
b64395de-afa6-43ec-9c8e-b3231608324c|Not until each of them has declared their hand.
4c2197a4-e6ff-4887-9e68-646d7eb0aa06|Since the day it was declared.
253c0b2a-9ea5-4b33-92cb-e74a6b3d0fd1|We're in the middle of a new ad campaign.
c1141105-720b-4057-b85d-ba3f9fb48f37|I have a cool idea for your ad.
e11e6aa7-a171-4160-bd8c-946c8fb72fd0|Most of us got started writing want ads.
ef16c7ad-302d-44c0-9d91-51e772164a16|We have a deal on the ads.
d1ad1914-6a98-4ec1-846d-40e565d36c86|His ad says he never fails.
5b4aa083-3206-4ac9-916b-fa37a510bd0b|Are you truly ready for it?
15346ec4-6012-44e4-b02a-91acfd9060b2|I truly believed we were in love.
5bc32377-b366-4cdc-bfef-1ee1b3f639a0|Are you truly even a human?
d9490384-1cb1-4335-ba94-f7864363bad9|I need to get back to my home planet.
93c40ee7-497a-4866-ad79-aaeebe8d2a05|Jim, I just lost my planet.
3ced413c-cc37-4826-bea4-657f6223c519|By selecting them and marrying them.
2cd96d2b-f1ab-433f-8326-aa3de3f752fb|If they're selected, they sign contracts on the spot.
6d8a5f3c-1fc5-4e49-b656-1e700d093ac5|Just make sure you have selected the right one.
aa241eb9-f7ad-4071-9a88-8b8417b57535|He was selected for officer training.
af41a3d1-d3d3-4545-8aca-9fb00a1d9b69|I was wrong about the ethnic reason.
bacb3d2d-ceee-4671-9d83-e8068e8817f9|I've never understood ethnic pride.
742e4ab5-1803-4955-9f45-546b6d26e489|I met a lot of ethnic girls.
f5cf556c-deef-48be-a7a3-3a1c527b26aa|He says you have a thing for ethnic women.
2fa961f2-655b-48c8-b572-7e75cac7a20c|Out with the nose and white skin!
45bf61b4-56b9-4e4a-b7ca-74eadaeafebc|Too bad about her hair and her nose.
a26c55dc-99c2-4a57-994e-422cf1894819|Now stop crying, and blow your nose.
4ca9dab4-263d-435d-a5e7-94aec53e5807|Why did she have to stick her nose in?
6d15e44a-dd4b-4e80-b22e-2f9b0cbca03b|Do we know what the loan was for?
ce8d28cc-1f03-4d33-b2ea-1494aac97604|In case she asks for a loan.
a67105bc-a750-4a61-8889-8646166ad379|I come to ask for a loan.
13a52b67-8272-4928-9210-9f6bc7fd3e93|It's a loan or we see both your cards.
58fbf7fe-2991-485b-b876-6b6749aee1ad|I'm going to take a big cash from them.
d7d9dd38-dc04-4f68-b7ab-e950415164c7|But we can't receive the cash.
79235304-a131-4269-aec3-3498fbe391a2|He runs slow even for a normal person.
7e37dafd-05f9-4f91-9d71-1123485f247b|You guys always this slow?
02aa2a92-9ac2-4cfb-a4aa-41a432c3bb18|But no, he's my boss, so we're going slow.
d921b11b-e1f2-4973-ba89-d1daf816aec0|I was able to compare and contrast between readings.
b044c156-b71e-427b-ada5-9461402b6567|Then compare and contrast them.
470c976d-8fef-430a-852f-3c838f83e4c0|He was a study in contrasts.
56989a37-1ee6-458a-84aa-f6e66658e3c4|I bought six bottles of it.
22108910-ec22-4a5c-8e94-163969823d41|Do you go and collect bottles?
dd47948f-97db-43d6-a4d1-fd1273c8c107|And he's drinking from the bottle.
1cafa1a4-f969-4c98-9a42-edb92824dc52|That girl, she launched herself at me, you know?
a1279950-2529-4140-bfea-35542f49ef7b|That is why I'm launching my music career.
8dc5e03d-4887-4c63-9192-f1d8e7a53bda|When it's complete, we launch it into their sun.
2304acf7-031f-4b8c-b5c3-c41e230e41af|You could even launch a new career here.
416ac478-699b-4b8e-8dc0-a085b69ac20c|I think they're launching smaller ships.
2cf6c09f-eb75-4857-998d-6309c0e58999|It's not meant to be that kind of novel.
820b7c2d-0c71-4ec2-a3fa-603ac3d6f690|Well, what about your novel?
8173c12c-e91b-4045-8bda-1ea8b28bb1d9|And you're interested in my novel?
dd290b7e-72ba-49ec-b046-c6cc48d50fdf|And where do we feature?
c831bb92-f309-4611-b074-f34bfd48d81f|Do you meet everyone featured in the paper?
0562b215-d5c1-49d5-aa51-60e67d6809e2|In it times it featured in magazines.
5411d5d8-0f62-4868-b009-5500ea284b31|It is a whole new series featuring many things.
2515e0b9-45b3-4bd9-8a4f-63c341b010c0|Your mother's featured in it a lot, too.
3168be34-c96e-4496-9548-003b4e26eb91|I have to get back to my duties.
b893d505-ee6f-4db2-b37f-f2ecc3b74987|Let's see if you can handle clean up duty.
b930df90-5a65-4336-a34d-99d977e9dcf2|You're staying here and doing your duty.
aa036440-e3ae-4643-92b3-b23a92c8943d|But he's on duty at the hospital.
8d769f9f-7b90-4dea-afe3-f424f60e9d2d|Shouldn't you be on duty today?
b991e7d7-21bf-45a8-a5a6-7613bc2f19fc|Our religion does not take root in this country.
04881941-1230-48be-9063-3ae3249fc570|'Cause tonight, we're getting back to our roots.
2e41611b-860b-40db-b568-116b0cea108a|If roots strong, tree survive.
c48f0f7c-68a2-4617-a9b9-fb4271fb8eca|We live to make our girl content.
6b598633-a0b7-49aa-8739-76fd0e1ef67a|Do we get to decide what content that is?
be413e96-de17-4bbd-8df5-c4e6a983069f|But not the content, not what you say.
e87b7947-e749-4e74-a0b3-fdf77ad896e5|But, again, I appreciate the thought.
af5fc2d1-4209-4652-85f2-de93c639e1e4|No, there isn't, but I so appreciate the thought.
5877daae-dcf2-456c-848f-510e3028fedf|I don't think my wife would appreciate it.
541c0d33-f532-4a40-90c8-5304294eb093|As I was saying, this is a teaching hospital.
75bab1a6-3312-401d-a38a-24edeb5a2c12|Teaching is all he lives for.
b37792a3-f3ad-4b4d-9f76-315524214697|Well, as you know, this is a teaching hospital.
c7044c37-b6fa-4e1c-8ce9-8fb45d80e0e8|Little Julian had painted a girl surrounded by stars.
23ab69b4-9bb9-4336-bb9c-489aa1b9de50|This I paint when I was a boy.
84b21b82-763b-4543-9d19-1bc216181def|Anything to paint me the bad guy.
36d87360-be1f-4170-8696-d7e5c79b6afe|As long as it's painted like that.
70c9a031-d061-4f43-bc0d-8dc7d900b2c9|Now let me paint this picture for you.
bec5e6eb-5c78-4b6e-84c9-ddc2743e3e8b|It doesn't matter how we do it.
1d2484ca-0700-4ba4-9dc3-da91f3541569|And what does it matter now?
112d8ed8-31d8-4fa2-8396-421fb9481065|No one's ever told me I mattered before.
d6e15f15-781a-4381-87ac-a9b6a9ff5232|Because it wouldn't matter if you did.
81f9fc58-a3b7-40e4-9eea-4ef189dafa9e|But let me go into the thick of things.
3b55a93d-aacb-4ac2-8e97-413638da4625|I thought you had a thick skin.
8c95ef06-d6e0-4429-a479-739dfa480056|Make sure it's thick and green.
5fe9cbd8-2e6e-45f1-a72a-da14922f4fce|Time is thick with speeches and cigarette smoke.
5661e027-2bf5-443b-b7de-b278d6df005c|What makes you think I have cats?
293578d5-9b40-460b-8c6c-8d205916f957|Come on, now, big cat.
912deeed-247e-4f04-b09f-16cded43a3c7|In this dream, we both become cats.
d5c9136e-9785-4693-90f2-11e4aaad708b|This cat lady no one even talk to.
6afc32ed-3f02-490e-8002-17e2baffa2c6|Well, I can't have a cat.
a0fea9dc-41d0-40c8-a8c0-278591e79ab9|He can neither see nor hear us.
11c3f52a-ded0-4c8b-a6fd-c6967c336f81|If you're guilty, Thomas, you shall have neither.
2d007f69-88e8-41b7-803c-7dbce976ef2c|Well, you ain't saying any stuff, neither.
9ada005d-52d1-417e-b11a-e0a412281fb4|Then you are neither of your parents.
04bc1fa6-9638-47f2-811a-175e3ef4c818|If I can't sleep, neither shall he.
92b38845-7401-49ec-b65f-a4fdcd5bb140|And come to think of it, neither do I.
aee6c883-6f2e-44a4-bbd9-d4a8ca02482d|Yeah, me neither, for the same reason.
bc39d336-683b-4132-889e-a126640c3cb9|I just need to run through the standard questions.
34a469fd-1be8-413f-a59c-700c4f3fd78a|He tested negative for the standard five.
b041e05e-771b-4b27-a809-8b90513806cf|Well, yes, then they became the standard type.
816707db-b9cb-4d65-a78f-5bf8fb679075|It's standard procedure, break the new boys in.
0b959ae5-d3a7-4ef1-9e98-dd7c58921a34|She didn't really use any standard interview techniques.
95299893-a801-4a89-a245-104d9aef31ca|Well, we might need to use it on ourselves.
ed2515b2-c873-4b3e-93cc-bcdb4c215576|We just kept ourselves to ourselves.
1fef3371-0de4-49b5-888d-5b45319cae0a|I mean, what do we got ourselves?
47d79f68-925d-4520-b833-d61ebfe142d9|We are going to have to stop him ourselves.
bf662130-cfa5-4eec-b1b2-5e1073956e1f|I hope my age is correct.
f7603045-11e4-400f-a1bc-9899b68ce994|I can't say that's completely correct.
ee534c12-b1e3-406a-b217-cbd2876e49ae|You just asked the correct question.
c3e7154c-98b3-44b0-87dc-ce3f18aae7c9|Yeah, no, you didn't warn me at all.
5a92c861-a0e0-4025-88fb-fd602c195ae2|And I'm warning you, leave us alone.
c3a6dceb-0367-4e4a-bfcc-cee2b3c76305|Didn't I warn you not to follow me?
8579a93a-b9db-4783-819f-c6588eb17dfd|How come we weren't warned?
e81fcac9-1d3b-41c6-98c7-65e25d5abe03|Obviously, I'm not here on an official capacity.
6c531c0a-8e11-4c0c-a837-513bb08f2648|Oh, I'm not here in a sexual capacity.
7fc2185c-77d0-4bda-a067-6cb9ae95cf27|You said you have a capacity for ten million.
4b269d5e-d4c3-4218-8f06-12e6440ddc03|We were at capacity, they wanted in.
d2a8b6fe-2306-4a51-9346-9f6129542b7d|Step forward and challenge your opponent.
e6badfa5-8d83-41ef-98a8-aa06b3653fce|I want to challenge your master.
43ecc107-fde4-43b9-9d4f-aea2e8a3b9b1|And what challenges does that present a defense attorney?
768ce14f-d669-478e-acbd-1a34cdf3da3a|You know full well it's the convention on Thursday.
5e28ffcb-204a-4c3f-86dd-f58aa215f2dc|He flew in two days ago for this convention.
fd516210-26c9-4a56-a793-2c6f678ca391|I've never written a speech for a politician.
68f8d60e-affb-40b0-840f-ccead452db28|So, who're they pursuing, then?
09c88866-ffc4-4db4-92c6-d9a02dbcd94a|And then she pursued and I withdrew.
ecf540ec-b7f0-47ea-b402-0ee8829774a7|Are you sure you want me to pursue this?
cc12c7a9-08ce-497b-87e6-f703eb2ad6b0|He's adjusting your chair settings.
c6c9ab1a-112d-4293-bc0a-705a06046a33|Todd, we need two more place settings.
07cb48d3-2e53-4a36-adb7-37888cd8c067|I'll bring the extra place settings right away.
b8d2e164-3845-43d4-ab96-a0881bd210cd|I was in the zone, baby.
630c62e6-1200-4bcc-b30d-be3d23e3cd6e|It has two time zones.
6a38f49e-a16c-4f4a-b771-0e7c0360a70f|I'm totally in my zone right now.
948792dc-7e59-471d-8a51-9aeddea21060|It looks like a war zone to me.
d2292db3-eb34-4a00-8e2d-0fedc7b2a6bf|That's 'cause I'm wearing the same dress.
5b84b40a-8175-4897-a71d-284f237444ab|You picked out a wedding dress.
42a5b7bb-316b-45f2-8747-dc8b03d169ba|That dress was my sister's!
7314993d-57ef-4d0f-82c6-4099c0f5c762|You want to talk about this pilot or not?
c900b2f6-2454-4749-a322-e81e62d43ffc|But who's gonna pilot the ship?
0849df79-9490-484f-93f1-19699e378b57|You're lucky to have her as your pilot.
17f3b0f6-58be-4966-a3d6-7648a67580da|I've set up a pilot interview for this morning.
aaee97b2-932c-44b4-b598-e87ded648679|I expect you to ensure he does not.
4cb9a305-00d5-4090-965d-b663ee4863c4|That I would ensure your safety.
d7118a2f-8486-428b-934b-537bb2c498b3|It's really just to ensure your safety, doctor.
f089f518-ec19-40f2-99b1-40e984c82d39|But his death here will ensure that never happens.
54cf856d-f347-4606-a02b-a7ed41fc8f7d|But, ultimately, yes, it was Stephen's baby.
e7985d95-116b-4e44-9a1d-cb92874a357a|But ultimately what's the real difference between the two?
8f2a3446-25fe-4f56-a652-bb558426c67e|Well, Chicago's ultimately a small town.
a4fd7970-ab9b-407e-a7c6-ab8448213bc6|There's a second male in the car.
81bfcbd0-6759-4f69-aad2-a247fe5395fb|He's the hottest male nurse here.
e61c0bd0-f9c7-4451-bc80-617e89380194|We gave the human male two breasts.
038e48b9-8c11-4038-8465-f06e9066758f|My stupid male pride made me lie to you.
808afa85-3dc4-4805-927f-0e45d4d64895|When I woke up, the bread was gone.
ef62d4cd-09f9-4a43-8bfe-46f7158f873c|Your music's woken an old friend.
572c6818-da65-4396-94b9-26dc08777f1c|I woke up in your shirt in your bed.
dfe76794-0142-4899-a77f-d80e276381b6|You're here to pick up your shirt, aren't you?
e4a8457b-6f78-41fb-a776-752a8a62e885|You can keep your shirt on for this.
fef8ec53-9c56-4b90-8f9d-4e798a36298a|Where is your white shirt?
eef69ae2-2ad1-4177-82d2-1aea6af55762|You're going to kill me and your white shirt.
ffed32b9-bb72-4e66-ad8f-be73d990a469|You're the most easily influenced person I know.
7155b4d2-a3ce-4c35-8956-d3633756ef80|He'd probably be an easy kid to influence, right?
fdc3f076-e39b-4d27-8190-40f75873571a|I mean, is this an attempt to influence him?
71b47188-2ac4-4cc0-bc57-5518510bac51|No, no, of course they're not influenced by money.
0e8bbc2d-50ed-499b-ad62-8deb5205ec0b|Never trust a man who owns a sex guide.
7881e6e4-4575-4eb2-b52a-06069b408126|I don't care, you've been the best tour guide.
8a2edc41-ef09-4594-8317-a1584470c157|I have a contact for a guide.
0a2230b1-eee6-45eb-b5de-d7e438993646|They say you should never mix business with pleasure.
66dad3db-a031-4297-b29d-cc733015681d|That library always get stuff mixed up.
aeca916e-4b18-4a41-a47b-e314602d3ebd|Then why did you stop me from mixing them?
e018ebf0-032c-4030-a947-aa162a857353|My little girl is mixed up in this.
6e59e741-94e8-4a27-8a66-2dc4f7b229a3|This is some kind of slipping through the bars.
d58b10fd-f3b1-4104-8d90-1698ca367e53|It was like I kept slipping out of time.
8675b5f8-fd5d-4e96-98d9-9c92abe4f4c1|She didn't just slip away!
be0ee9d0-ed46-4027-b03f-cfeaac3b3d03|If I don't work, we'll have to steal.
a7f2a26c-3ee6-4322-b7f6-2e0163803d47|I can't steal cars no more.
c62e3cf8-c1c5-436f-854b-02030fee69c4|He says it was stolen some time ago.
c4e2e6be-ffd9-40b8-9219-7adbbb8a6b37|Why did you let me sleep late?
fa748c7d-2f53-49d5-81fe-31b17fd68554|I will not be late very much.
7046451a-5e03-4eef-a7d9-cf8e797bd9ba|Oh, I am so sorry I am late.
2cf003ac-82c8-4661-b27b-9c65e9a76fcc|I'm running late as it is.
b87df710-83e8-4a76-822c-77994b315080|I know, don't blame myself.
2c09a49a-2a72-48f5-94ef-d6edfeafa8f2|He can't blame you for this.
1b833c70-3be3-402e-a9ac-aa6846e43aee|I blamed you for your mother's death.
127efab5-e201-4b09-8549-a228e9071461|Who else should we blame, Kevin?
e071d078-7e78-4a69-b816-510fee81381d|No, you're not blaming me for everything.
d98cee91-50df-4a98-889c-75758b8647b2|I mean, check out these sheets.
aabb548e-809e-4d46-9b21-01f36b2f0c12|Are you gonna hand out sheet music?
7befaea0-7e37-472f-952f-870b9fa7c76b|What you got a sheet on for?
a8a45657-4f52-4739-bc50-64a4393d26e9|I hope there is enough clean sheets.
831ed2ba-51fe-40b2-acaf-5b60fe2b100d|Jackson, sheets, pass me the sheets.
45f1483a-bcd0-4b70-ac0b-e78a1a629d04|How do you estimate that?
6e877c3e-46db-4ef3-931b-c54a6f73b33e|And what exactly do you estimate that to be?
5f5f31b8-a211-4361-81ca-b584028f7d9b|This has filled me with a sense of relief.
50410395-1ec9-4d8f-8784-b86812ce7386|Well, we'll take any relief that we can get.
15518e0c-19d3-4331-bb5b-73c89c68b829|It was a relief, in the end.
3fe403d7-4889-491b-b3bc-b93316c388f8|I was thinking perhaps some pain relief?
fb471497-b8ff-4160-a3af-193c75489cbf|I know it's a relief to you.
33b21f17-aa05-40b1-bd9f-1afdef5b19f6|Your proposal, our investors aren't interested.
44694206-9fac-4cd2-81ac-8b5e8e485994|For my current investors, things are going great.
e240431c-e90b-4887-b9e2-1fa4fcea2950|If this gets out, I could lose my investors.
fe1c7f3d-bc45-4db5-875c-48fbc8e11b81|After I was prepared to hang for its silence?
8db8552d-2c30-43bd-9da4-764159ff7827|Let's silence the radios and the phones.
bc40a9a3-759f-48d3-8818-2b74b076c8d6|Oh, let's do it in silence.
2426e47a-6fec-4bf4-bd46-441e31ddedd6|Can't you do this in silence?
75e5dc62-51fe-4b41-9319-746bb3087894|I don't know the manner of death yet.
76459880-be86-40c7-8c68-f7d55dcd666c|I'm sorry about the manner of his death.
88397a78-b08b-47b2-a0b5-af9b8ad698e0|Teaching him manners is one thing.
b791dc56-308c-44ab-a464-ae84fb6ab229|Let's just discuss this in a reasonable manner.
fb620fda-9e03-4b0b-9083-2b6a55866d5f|That enough muscle for you?
9e4dfc07-11ed-4c43-9156-bd8ac6b01a16|He sent some asshole to muscle me.
e48377b9-82c2-494c-b0e9-e53690474ece|Don't move a muscle, or I'll shoot you!
c6c7bc0e-6701-4469-9a9e-0fbd3890bd07|And what are your muscles made out of?
06fc85b2-c345-4a95-be8a-7d8ee2c48096|Don't move a muscle, and just stay put.
19bba96c-e773-4ac9-a3b9-a114d49009df|I have never seen her at the branch since.
a7411035-2af2-43fe-9664-c0746eb62c9f|As long as we branch out after that.
66dde27d-15fa-466a-a9fc-bd4648686377|And tall, got some branches.
e376fe42-41ec-45cd-bb2d-271ae256ce05|Those branches are only a few feet down.
9d58db90-6425-4bbe-870d-6bbf4c0bb79e|The point is, I'm moving up the food chain.
68325819-49a1-4f95-8e72-c4b9f5188054|They have chains on the doors and windows.
e3f3c03d-9edf-45ae-8f3a-8ae9c6357144|I believe there's still one chain in working order.
3d4460f7-99a3-480c-9a45-aeb92203fde0|It's a police telephone box from London, England.
38a80171-58e8-412c-9423-c2bb395be769|She will not speak to me on the telephone.
f7072e1b-d74b-4247-ba8b-2990a2c854dd|I came down because I heard the telephone.
c666248d-0b31-4fa7-bc1c-b684cd99698a|Oh, I had planned to telephone myself.
baab843a-2837-4bc7-a73e-68d440ad9d2e|You drinking some new kind of German beer?
e76f8dc4-41f8-454e-95c7-05b5cfdc3473|If I was a German, you would be dead.
95882bea-daf9-427b-b359-96a6c12445f7|Your gang, they are German?
a9fc5eda-8163-42fe-aa9b-49b56ac9229f|German authorities refused us access.
f3480698-1dfa-4fd1-bfb8-56582f2d3d73|To build a German tank in full size.
1cf5ccb9-6c7c-49c6-94ab-291cfefaabb7|I never wished for that outcome.
5ab39852-e96d-41f4-9f47-479bc554e266|You are prepared for the outcome?
5d53898a-a789-4f63-8a23-8a815b9b668d|A successful outcome is in our mutual best interests.
4cddfec8-9ef8-4021-bc36-57bacdd72c04|Just so you know, I'm not accepting this outcome.
7419ab5b-4e94-4117-8614-b3bdcafcd4e3|Testing times are coming for these estates, indeed.
836d5f68-82d1-43ee-b6b0-7a0d5eac3d5d|Now, that's real estate that's worth ruling.
68e1cf51-e1f8-4cdf-8724-044b69d4992a|We didn't come here to take an estate.
9dd38c53-1b61-42d2-baa1-3addadb752f8|What happened on that estate?
1142352d-c0ac-419c-8b0f-911da279da46|She begins to move her hips back and forth.
7ed19180-01ac-4f0f-9529-adcdec1ff62d|We could go back and forth all day.
8d8edac7-e953-46fe-8788-091fa523fbbf|Today you go forth into the real world.
bf2a0168-d3b8-4202-9960-4954d24f272b|Otherwise nothing will grow forth.
f712130e-4a7c-450a-a4d5-29e11aa587bf|I mean, we're always going back and forth.
a99799f7-1a43-4224-9935-87f0259b8f8e|I'm under too much stress.
601dcbfd-7132-468d-b066-05683c9ca180|I mean, it really helps with stress.
56cae7f5-f9ea-4bd7-8634-f36703e4eca2|Because stress is making my hair fall out.
c0c77ab7-7e9a-4d5b-85ff-e98c5208c6f5|No, you don't want a stress ball.
339fd807-c934-47d2-b4ee-6d32db9d7b6d|I cannot consider him equal to the rest.
df95fcca-0696-4afa-aeea-73093ccfecf7|Two men own equal victory.
a048233f-be15-4a96-912c-f063bda3de48|All men are not created equal.
9b47b767-b80e-4311-8946-cf92161c83fb|If they're all equal, what does it matter?
eb70d254-d930-4711-b2fc-d55aa9fc35a4|That would be enough for English final.
f8a78eb9-8290-4186-bee9-0594a4c09821|You can't read English anyway.
026823d3-4692-4c9b-8c05-ecdfc10e312e|You have to fit in the right English words.
02af2c44-45ed-47d5-ab32-fbb31beb6c42|Have you brought the English soldiers?
0cf75dda-b567-40e8-b431-919053a56b84|Her lowest grade is in english.
d47972d8-7708-4bd5-8cc6-7a67884be239|She said she'd give everything to the welfare center.
94837835-5c77-4bdc-a800-790bfa170b47|I want that welfare, Dennis.
3f926fdc-459a-4f6d-8e26-ecbb42e82faf|No, I am definitely not on welfare.
697dac6b-d2fe-47cc-9f2c-8bda7f016eec|It isn't the boy's welfare this is about, really.
ccbecb07-c2b0-4302-b3c4-d1abcbf7cd91|Do you think you're on welfare?
8d19d487-5cc5-416e-93c7-116b98bd449c|Because you're acting like a typical guy.
a3b65bdb-411a-4d53-a4b9-b65968acbf82|It was just a typical Monday morning.
7a9def5a-b8fc-47d0-a9d0-f22753645f84|That's actually not that typical at all.
40df0035-8a7b-4aac-bb06-1edc1d3a8cef|The last few days have hardly been typical.
bdf5f5c8-0036-40da-95f5-8ae6d9b8fe83|You're driving the guys crazy in Los Angeles?
871afe25-9e89-4a18-9179-ee0b2c41d42c|So why you been acting all crazy?
d34be6e5-f87e-4fcc-8573-62401e39de6c|You'll see, it's a crazy city.
a872ad17-1085-491c-9ae0-4601cd714557|I don't care about anything except going home.
f62c6528-4209-4180-a9b4-194b5bb66165|Except you only come around when you need something.
59de3724-647a-489c-a526-8a290946d8d9|Except for what he said.
74a92a4b-04dc-4268-9ad6-ba1727879824|Except every life ends about now.
185224ac-3b58-4e80-a78d-05c6dc3414c7|You talked funny when you went to school here.
3170163b-ef38-421a-8382-de728d090c0b|You didn't used to be funny before.
69af0199-8def-4a39-81e9-a53cdd86332d|Well, it's already funnier than most of your stories.
f4921dda-9138-4032-83a9-95ce254226c6|Oh, that's such a funny joke.
389c1960-1062-4b4f-9b41-0d99d3f1bb7c|The funny thing is, it was there all along.
dcdfaec9-4e6d-4de0-a8a4-38f79f3945af|He didn't tell you what kind of meat?
72f4c960-fd1f-4455-84ee-0673a9da3b25|Cutting down on red meat.
8b9d130e-4cf9-4ad9-b3b7-435cf65b4e6d|Five different meats in one big box.
8fd1825f-6637-4972-9aca-38b5acd321fd|It was here, and now it's meat.
5b2d0007-f67a-4311-8ae1-b5b5cec57951|Your story has less commercial appeal.
20caef27-6e73-4a47-8273-46f995627d48|Why weren't you at the appeal yesterday?
5a275f2b-2b57-4a96-9d8f-bfb832cecfe1|The court turns her final appeal down.
6dd727b7-31ea-47ce-a381-75159bdf93a2|Nothing about that appeals to me.
e7c9e6b4-0844-4716-93aa-03f476581bce|Let me do this with the official shirt on.
ad21287a-1ad3-4390-968a-2be8edb6d6bd|On an official report, you lied.
bf47fcc6-1ef5-4767-bd96-799afa369231|Well, why don't we give you the official test?
f2dcba04-9a4b-406c-9637-0272445d7d30|Call it an official peace offering, I suppose.
608b706c-e1f1-4624-9655-5624a83192a9|They're making moves even now to eliminate me.
c3b6f8aa-e3ea-4d20-b99a-439cb8e0c168|That would at least eliminate one.
4ccab0a9-0cc2-4b00-8ea4-86dd8ce2f1ad|Your orders are to eliminate them.
7bb622ea-5c8a-46b5-932f-e1492d0ca5a9|Used to get into a lot of trouble.
0fb4a30e-33d6-4087-af47-eadcadb64de2|Used to work security for him.
f9816bd4-9db4-49d2-aeb7-8744b8c1b43f|Used to think I had people on the outside.
9140d196-d9ec-4311-8457-878862e95496|Used to be pretty good at this.
18ffad1a-d733-47b3-8b24-bb98f7672366|If you have something to say, make a motion.
b10c4d31-6497-4944-926b-b6467ecc04af|And so, Michael's plan was put into motion.
100974cc-dfb8-4d87-a24a-ac4dd1468e70|We got motions coming up.
05fbe4ab-29b4-4841-9323-2ff8485b48e1|You don't complain about anything, do you?
161e0e93-0e55-41b4-98f5-a91e92c88117|When I complained, he broke the other one.
7ba91dbd-0279-4593-8363-5f614cac85e9|You wish to complain about my level of service?
aa0bc18b-c8fe-490f-bc32-ca9cec236b2d|Have him row in circles until we return.
fdd07633-62c5-436b-8aa2-fdfe20cb2136|You see who's sitting in the second row?
af47cd0a-d3d9-4a14-a1a1-8456d53a4423|After all this time, two days in a row.
f1332e7c-2765-47f6-bcc1-456ffe43f0b6|Not my brother on death row.
f0bc6a55-1316-46ce-892d-e93955510294|I'm in charge of searching through Jewish houses.
486208f5-3afb-4550-be51-91aec436c806|We need more Jewish police.
5b276bd2-c90e-44a9-9278-0df414c10077|She went with a nice white Jewish boy.
8156fb77-b0a3-4868-a828-4ad57f34091a|What parts in a car are Jewish?
e8e2c53c-bb7b-42d1-bd0e-1024d3adee67|Only to throw us down and kick us out.
417aafbb-d3ff-4d9a-83c2-eb8008c3367f|I've already kicked my door in for the year.
ef21bbb3-4f66-4a1e-8de9-1ee4a841dedb|I don't want to get kicked out.
44be5613-a923-4b86-b924-c6fa4ca1bd46|Can we kick them out?
68dc210c-ae89-4de4-89ed-e217d50650a7|They say the snow is coming.
5a847e4b-1490-4f42-ac22-f349be23abc6|What is your problem, snow?
c4d2e1e6-cfbd-49af-95e4-723840544525|When the snow falls, it'll be too late.
f922a02e-981b-4f3b-970a-37bfc545a9f7|That ring would look funny with snow on it.
dcff6e40-0754-4e79-9997-42ea76aeeb13|And I don't need producers to tell me that.
dc6119d5-7e16-4c91-8f7d-9022eb1dce35|Well, I've got a great list of producers.
9e4a787e-8658-4f0c-9f45-c8ef36ebe0e6|Are you sleeping with the producer?
1a06f65a-2be9-462d-a2dc-9d627ee012a0|He set me up with a really good producer.
4754ebdb-4712-41a0-82d5-b07c58956bd0|No, I want to solve this myself.
6e2d41e4-d8ca-4c14-a4fb-75ac21f05700|It's not gonna help me solve crimes.
7477c1f7-651e-4e6b-97ef-9e42bf1926c5|And I thought I'd solved my problems!
62768d38-23ac-4a3f-b571-a01f3c48503f|The dog problem has been solved.
25897f46-a6c1-4062-83e5-ed2e199aba99|Let's just watch and get it over with.
b4646a23-5bc9-438b-ae26-15ae806c52ca|You want me to just watch?
0e530e53-f419-4ab4-bfbf-eeede92416f2|So, you may as well just fire away.
de084bcb-b1b2-4436-8a76-a7597f02f9ce|I saw her just moments after you left.
31f42764-ea4a-4529-a7bf-d9dd0d7582f1|Joe, I need you to issue that order.
8dbb1a08-a86e-4132-9c87-10312450ebd8|They stopped issuing hunting licenses.
e86cccec-5555-41e4-9df5-d2ef274cfa30|Too small for an issued weapon.
eb8fcee2-7a49-40e7-809e-9d777b096b42|And who are you to be issuing orders?
70583077-37b8-4dd8-974b-8253c896a96a|So, I'm hearing that you've joined the opposition.
5ab0164f-dd9a-4a60-bdd5-6ac7ea4d8906|I have an opposition to that decision.
3bbe969e-baeb-417a-8b8e-642bb57efd80|Which he uses to eliminate his political opposition.
5108b83c-1f19-4704-9def-61c1e4739152|We'd have no opposition in the election.
58d85cb5-2069-42d3-8db4-b577980973d0|That means I can play basketball with Alex.
823a492f-8328-43b9-99af-8c26fca60ee6|I guess you'll be glad when basketball season's over.
1fefa5a0-3768-49cb-8f47-db8c2a8baf5a|Everything I know about basketball, I learned from women.
e44f116d-d414-4589-af0a-d327ff8f6aa0|We need volunteers for our Sunday basketball league.
3ea28256-aaf6-4f0f-8aae-96767f20aa7e|He says it's about basketball.
83b13b3a-e60c-4a14-9c5b-d545962e3493|I relied only on my commanders.
f8e13bde-4423-4b01-91f0-c9650c29c9d5|These poor bastards rely on me!
a9e697a5-55cc-4172-a1d4-b0ee9701745a|I rely on him, Joe.
c5834beb-8341-4658-8d41-3c24a4412496|You could rely on him?
3206ec87-91b1-48b3-9b00-c21f8685411b|Since then, you rely on your memory.
c79e0815-3fe2-4890-bf88-2fd0573be80f|She told me herself she can't be trusted.
032dd0ea-16af-4d1c-88e2-86c764c5394c|If he's ignoring you, it's because he trusts you.
33049f0e-7d37-4f11-9339-c78d6c0aafd7|Nobody trusts a guy with a record.
d5d3f02e-0226-4382-b1f3-3405b6a50985|Kelly would have trusted her.
499b2ecc-a0e3-43bf-ae74-ec0744eabfd6|I got to start trusting you in your decisions.
d0051e50-4f20-4fba-b354-60fff9469c07|I need you to back up.
016d54b4-ea7a-486d-9fd2-5d52f9bc5f3f|Have you got opinions to back that up?
60e36cf2-18ae-4ec0-b5a8-3e5de4195f17|Well, do you have a last known address?
a80b8e35-7312-4b43-a923-7319c0de6e48|You don't show as living at that address.
04e7fe60-b0ca-43c1-8769-b7d12dc21fbc|Oh, good, so you have the address?
cd6889d6-1096-4e48-9fd3-2c59b7028389|What address are you looking for?
826e7ca9-09e3-4ba7-9023-615129b24064|You were the one who had her address, Mom.
363cdb58-fb64-4c4d-872e-e194cf5556c5|The words are smoke and mirrors, Leo.
99a580dd-bc3c-471a-93a5-bb8171fa0c34|He who has a friend, needs no mirror.
618eba44-ca7e-435a-b891-013565395265|Why can't I see them in my mirrors?
9704023a-93c0-4225-9fd2-92d23e882934|I couldn't see myself in the mirror.
d5c0f8ca-ef98-4842-be14-55e0ddada0c2|It's called a think tank, Ann.
88263409-c45e-4436-80e7-57825dd12d1a|It's worrying, put some medicine in the tank.
8c3b1490-4c46-4bb9-b278-9edd9ad7aa01|The tanks are filled with what?
f784ce30-0126-417c-aa0f-c2f6f3f5547a|Why don't I buy you a tank of gas?
4a84eb3b-3c55-4cf2-8554-9fdacfcee009|I could range around the world.
a3a44901-99fe-4c73-8727-90209c747db0|We got you ranged from both sides.
e19dd0d3-2dd2-430e-9419-b71c5a3a0f59|Sir, they have us acquired and ranged.
adef274e-bc9a-43f6-b513-eb3fd94b4794|We've got the whole thing ranged.
e101f926-40f2-458d-acfe-73a00f8b61b1|If you could manage a somewhat prettier wife.
6017126b-8d8e-473e-b044-bb6a3b124f3a|That is, a somewhat strange suicide, don't you think?
84508fa2-56b6-4c09-becc-6644c1d71cb8|It's possible, but somewhat unlikely.
c8c6e137-e11a-4fa8-a6f9-41c2df70876a|Let's get out there and attract their attention.
a28e3361-b356-4153-8280-bda95fa98880|Well, I guess I attract trouble.
d108e749-b73f-488c-8db4-c6603c34b732|You know, a lead can come from anywhere.
94c5e9f7-afc9-4b54-9118-1e4df88782a5|It didn't lead me anywhere.
5f504290-99a4-4a80-a01b-75721205b052|Anywhere will do if you pick the right day.
6bd9d740-51bf-4e83-8936-3f5d21b5cd45|We aren't going anywhere, right, girl?
62a0c845-fb27-4f06-9ef7-5746caae00c8|Anywhere that's better than here.
d6100584-b0b3-4662-afc9-ffb5bfab009e|The regime isn't the same as it was.
c315fa87-e994-47a2-b20c-4d4016a326e1|You want to live under that regime?
1818cdc1-cf4b-4967-af92-4a74eb8601ee|Under this regime, it will not leave this office.
f0d24cf4-8fa7-4bbd-86a8-469e373444d3|No way I can get him fixed before Monday.
fc689010-56a6-42d0-b17c-c30b6e809f13|I'm not sure I can fix this.
0bbdd30f-9abb-4ba3-a0cf-4a2490612d27|I made that guy fix.
708bd358-683b-44c9-9d0e-e59d6b05fbbd|I know exactly what to do to fix this.
db4d64ee-141f-40e1-8a25-0605c99d46c8|And assumed entirely too much.
d7fe85fa-6e54-4372-b3d4-98082cb26b55|Oh, I think that's not entirely true.
4cbe3d93-8ad9-42c1-a467-81455df311ff|You can't, not without losing the company entirely.
0cc047d5-9b39-4d2c-ae51-3d64d9a7c0ed|I will now clean this up entirely by myself.
b6a93857-66e1-438d-a4ab-c9b6b14a812f|Because I can't afford it.
63a76e81-f415-487c-b544-39fe5921ba9d|That's all they can afford.
f2d785ac-7bde-4015-a7ea-788f58d8f0d8|I cannot even afford the books I need.
dada222c-7ad2-4bbd-92cb-fb820dffbddb|We can't afford to live alone.
e916a4f7-6e6d-4950-bce7-51bfe93152b7|Seven times the length, I've got down here.
4215ddfc-e43b-4a13-9e8d-8d185fbb442c|Oh, Don spoke, at length.
786c6f60-7d03-4f36-b6bc-5cafbedded47|And this time I'll go to any length.
86fa94cd-4017-4da2-af1b-b4457fcfc5e9|This length is set for me.
2ffd9930-4c36-4676-b13a-a65aeac660c4|You want to keep secrets with me, don't you?
2ba4b3fb-5b16-4819-99cb-d6d0d8ec094d|All you do is keep secrets.
4eff6a1c-7050-47ba-8230-61aab9dac026|I don't think you can keep it a secret.
b134ea62-c249-4101-ac7c-7468b25988fa|Maybe she was keeping it a secret.
387ed86b-297f-4864-8e0d-9c95514b1c81|Karen, the pleasure is entirely mine.
535dda15-872d-4a28-b66e-c3fc9bd97920|They want your wives for their pleasure.
4833c9f0-aa0e-4849-a09c-5df98d4b7395|Well, this has been a real pleasure.
f94b3fef-e19d-449d-b8af-eeea02377fbb|It's a pleasure doing business with you, sir.
750f44e7-82dc-4ed7-9eae-0a3f7fa39d86|Did you file the answer in federal court?
f321254c-406f-4efa-b3b0-a715bffee22f|There's been no charges filed.
71c59eb5-5cc6-42b5-b98d-a5a68474dc5a|But your mother never filed a missing person's report.
d3db8742-6548-4d91-abdd-519754c132d3|Work up files on all these people.
bddcfce0-1564-486f-9552-9e44cd80454a|Well, that's one way to pull a tooth.
fd7aef43-43cf-43d0-b3f5-f8c10cec32fa|I have anything in my teeth?
1d14ef6c-252b-459d-912d-ea7985b449c1|Don't look at my teeth for a long time.
6f5c6a47-b5e0-4e3c-ab96-3fb668ae0a24|Was too busy looking for my teeth.
c76436fa-f77f-449a-9204-8404075a54ec|Do you need more teeth?
d30fac5d-e860-4da0-b38b-c2d9644f9a5e|This is confirmed by the guards at the desk.
385b4b76-ac95-4a34-9c82-7339f83d5256|Let me confirm one more thing.
6868fb4c-6526-43ab-9d48-1371f7ee37cf|Figured we could use some separate time.
fad9c7de-8dec-4f15-9ffe-b9014743758a|I think we need to go our separate ways.
259f1597-483e-48f9-a7be-ffd54c87d334|Since when did you sleep in separate rooms?
1ac48310-784b-4681-86f1-933601d5c2b3|I think Julie should probably have separate council.
84ea2c4f-685c-47a8-89ba-8a55f52dcf71|Right now, every golden day.
af0ba825-a232-4dca-86c8-f2390ff311ad|You and golden can talk about it later.
8d937c30-def5-45f8-ae8b-0f260bafe9a2|That's, like, what they did on the golden girls.
d82e3021-0ee9-4fde-8a37-84839e6366a7|You coming after me again, golden boy?
bcd1e181-14bf-4d1d-981d-7d90421770a0|I always thought we'd spend our golden years together.
73dbaf5c-1140-4fd9-b39d-f2120321bc63|Meanwhile, we all get fat because of it.
13e87e44-f7e4-4d5b-83f8-db928b67a284|Yeah, meanwhile, Robin tells me nothing.
67d249ca-846e-45ed-a11a-977998a654ee|And meanwhile we'll take care of the rest, agreed?
a7d9b70a-0a82-4a32-a9d7-a7e667eafdc7|Meanwhile, she is talking to him about you.
93baccc8-13c3-40b8-904c-cc8108a4b8c4|You guys have all the pay channels, right?
4f3a49c7-5f62-4b80-bcc0-629e1f4f2ad7|Do we really need all these channels?
3e706e6a-7ede-440e-affb-5edf8557655d|Delivery will be made through the usual channel.
477c3b55-2aab-42ea-a82d-da576825b5c2|You must have switched the security channel.
9864abfc-5d57-4070-8cd6-3ed71aa3d7c2|Do you remember where my bedroom is?
74ae7edd-f0ca-4497-9538-dcbed3eb1368|He is in your bedroom.
dbcf91c9-082b-4424-aea0-13947a2944f5|No, I haven't seen your bedroom.
55e4fde5-a557-42b5-a562-34e2df4ea14c|There's a hole in the wall to your bedroom.
5c0b2043-6ac5-4582-bec2-aa1e2a773df0|I'd be ancient and you'd be exactly the same.
34013c8d-51da-46df-ab36-5d39d648b4af|Take my word for it, Harry's ancient history.
be11b6be-c358-492f-8510-bbd3168417c1|We're still locked out of the Ancient controls, though.
e89db72f-b8b7-43fb-ae56-3a25291be10c|For us, at time, that was ancient.
7b597aa1-7c4f-4b49-91c4-bec6302ddb62|We've got real time coverage of the station.
916c9cce-48d8-4788-894c-eefecb137a06|I need wide press coverage for this trial.
67b8cce4-b2f1-4b30-ab3c-e9481c5434ca|And we're switching over to live coverage.
a5ce8767-f18a-4cda-8bb3-ef286aae9562|And we're hoping for media coverage.
dae39ff7-02cd-4bce-a7c0-31ceb0983e22|Set up on that trail.
195b4e25-78d3-4239-9fd3-f9289cc76501|Now we follow his trail, - yes?
c2fe35b2-a018-42c3-9858-44778fb14ab5|I was never into leaving a paper trail.
b276ae88-cd6f-4464-9db1-4c48ae6b181f|I will make surprise for old Adam bear.
7fbd0aa3-d34e-4900-90e5-5fd0d4a6a7d9|He wanted to become like the bear.
4f1c01d4-0096-4714-a482-2a692a30816e|I read that bears aren't mean.
02916cc5-5fd4-4576-ada3-18814823fbe5|Go grab some coffee, maybe some bear hearts.
cba23fc6-7c97-40ee-8906-b2da6cd3f5f1|Well, actually, the bear just ate his hat.
4c564aee-67f6-43d3-a153-299c2be1528e|Our host wants to see you.
8f437ff4-c79e-41ec-8b82-0ea9c8c11d99|I am so sorry about killing your host.
53642812-e5b9-4642-8337-096c9f23110b|I can't have him host.
ffbd5d09-ea9f-4cec-b718-3a9ebbddd34f|It uses it to lay eggs inside a host.
c8ba332d-3882-4533-b623-ceb64f248f59|He had his whole life ahead of him.
bdf4c2cc-5ab1-42dd-9d61-1612049be384|He was killed by his own people.
748c0563-2457-4d16-8c4e-c6dbcd77f2ef|He liked to handle things on his own.
d86dc07c-b9ab-4e8c-a5f0-bd8b62c5cc85|His name is Mike Ross.
fa11c3db-9fe8-4b41-8c90-d745c611e5bf|I did a hell of a lot of checking!
930d870a-b2c8-4b3e-8a7f-6787cb0ac10a|Could you sign this check for us?
bb231bb8-b7c3-4aef-b5c1-4f85d3445e1a|I know when they're just making a check.
b76dd9b5-3821-45c4-8238-2efdaef55706|Okay, I'm just gonna check on dinner.
e0854c98-d2d3-43aa-bd01-69c17cd1c35e|I'm counting on you to keep him in check.
9940c603-c359-450b-a086-504738f5bd58|And someone standing over me.
55691bde-a3da-4c86-8057-0345a32647a0|Why don't we put your guy on the stand?
ea8d24d7-7205-42ad-b1f0-cfa3edb52ba7|You haven't understood, he was left standing.
cf5b3094-6723-4c1f-a0c9-a624b7ba4ea1|I think five stands will be enough.
98d850c9-d6e2-4e9a-97a1-c882dbc645c8|You're just gonna stand by your man?
23e4b8d2-9064-4bb5-b235-967ae9fd9009|She needs to go to surgery right now.
fbc9280b-0a3c-4a58-989b-c6988e891f24|I heard you talked Charlie into the surgery.
ad7e1bc6-9d35-4f52-a219-2ce88b687cb5|I'm afraid it's time to talk about surgery.
9f561cab-df62-4d40-a8c4-e382f9e7eccb|I am not taking him up for surgery.
aa3ad64a-3887-4ac2-8bed-fcec65cfc099|This surgery was supposed to make me normal.
ac63fa46-4e80-4901-bf5e-42317c1d777d|As you say, perception is everything.
bf427ea4-72ba-4133-ba70-c4d9ac1f819b|We need to influence public perception with this.
d38fc5de-977e-469c-a90a-1b29150d112b|Like most things, perception can be influenced.
0e086f47-9ccb-49f1-b56b-81ad409df76b|In this city, everything is about perception.
b34b5444-ae0a-4fae-a6df-a9ee6c9cf008|I have the right to change that perception.
ef833183-5e07-4dd9-8a64-5e8bb268010d|At least it would be extremely rare.
97203a1d-acbf-4945-9e66-7e5547b9002d|Because he collects and sells rare stuff.
c23cb929-0f46-45c3-8c50-e60559073b1d|And you have a rare chance to survive.
2afe7703-23af-4ecc-93af-0104e90fbe61|How rare is the gift of sight.
8387940d-f759-41cc-9f76-d06c1250b945|The guards prevented her and there was a struggle.
098b83da-215b-4a73-bbb9-ac0fbe6d9161|That struggle is going to get her hurt.
a40faca0-7d67-46a0-a386-0668c3620196|I think your struggle is really moving.
256a2ec1-b608-4e3c-a85a-a91d3f0e9f2f|I saw the struggle going on inside of her.
70d2885b-7e0d-4687-b4f6-fb7e871c1a15|This could be the end of an era.
b7f6db53-a34f-463c-a65f-9502877f186a|I grew up in the rock and roll era.
6a737e4f-8d4e-4710-8858-8d396f3a3ec9|We're really now moving into a new era.
d4195553-7737-4e4a-a437-e015293ac356|I think this era suits you, Nora.
0bc03e87-9727-416d-999f-8beb9e0a45f3|I find him, you grant me my freedom.
f74a38a0-0f37-4158-93db-58401708d890|All you do is take me for granted.
fbcb7a4f-4ad3-44fb-91d1-c6b807b78273|I told her I would not grant one.
499a0ae9-d82c-489b-a673-ba8b99ba3fe9|Freedoms we take for granted.
702bde28-9a6d-496e-9182-a40164bd4ad1|Look, I've been going over your file.
4601821e-10b8-4839-bb48-21ec3baa77a9|I need to get your file.
61274913-bc24-4977-8f7e-1ae98f4f6502|I read files, too, you know.
630965e4-4a31-4f17-94e9-6554fd55cc72|I brought this out of my files for you.
c86b105c-974f-4691-862d-dbfa711fbdc0|No, this isn't a case file.
d4187b5d-6aab-4e26-8e62-1663d1b2dbc3|The suspects came in and left from the ocean.
efe2156b-b2a0-44ca-9176-11bacfcfe709|I also saw him throw them into the ocean.
96b9b215-2f55-4056-b8dc-cd538f99f06e|What do I know about the ocean?
a62fec22-8e8f-43e8-a030-24c85c0aafa6|Let the ocean decide his fate.
9322c4fc-aa03-49b8-a58a-6a60649e07a2|Okay, then I'll take it seriously.
2005cbb5-7bd7-45b5-aa90-02ab3d003f76|You seriously have no brain.
11055c16-1ea6-429e-9fb5-e466a743bc68|Seriously, can we talk about our feelings later?
86e2228e-bf3f-49de-a298-20a37fbdc67b|Do you seriously expect me to believe that?
800d3ab6-ee8d-4190-bdb2-b79d4b787b19|I take my job very seriously.
36b90ccc-7f4d-4261-906c-b529181dc569|I'm clearing my desk for the weekend.
289a869b-bf10-48f3-be62-1eb8d3a98ddd|I came here to clear the air!
babe7e65-3a97-47a6-a2aa-bd3d5943957f|He doesn't want to clear his name?
e0bfddbe-151d-49d1-b3c0-904e93c9857f|We gotta wait until the place clears.
8b5fd59c-1da5-46a5-9716-304ce5aa9ed8|Yeah, they give me confidence.
97f8483e-261f-43ba-8a4a-6b12e97f8a3a|You're killing my confidence here.
fc6cb16b-8a30-4ac8-a137-32068bd1eaac|I told you those things in confidence.
e879fa09-8a80-4e04-9746-121039eb7ae3|Aside from that, you got nothing to worry about.
ab74fc18-8c6d-43af-9758-7ad7732ae821|Just put aside all your plans for the moment.
28b27727-4c43-4bf3-89d3-8bf058c6f0c5|How much time should I set aside?
19cd5050-c89c-42f7-8a0d-901c3c61cc25|Most of it is set aside for Christine.
8a30f0ab-088f-48b6-b9fd-3cb9c0bc1bc5|Do you think he was holding back tears?
4fe88f43-2655-42f5-8ede-d65437b1f8d1|Your eyes are full of tears.
31456935-4c93-4cbf-9843-36b621f36e06|I've been holding in tears this whole time.
e4bf823d-cc0d-41ba-890e-3c1eae226d9f|Doesn't that bring a tear to your eye?
8b8a8d02-1a83-41f4-b543-67c399f241e4|She told me that I never trust her judgment.
1de494cd-cbb1-4726-8fb8-fe049674f2db|No, no judgment, I promise.
cbda3867-223d-4e99-8eeb-121a2fb75bcf|Little judgment, but I still believe in him.
b03a2aee-c04e-4517-af86-b13fc258a416|Is there anyone whose judgment you trust as much?
23eae59b-e0d4-4d0a-9e8d-67d386d9a7dc|I don't believe that's a judgment I can make.
22eb8c07-77f2-48ff-9c8c-15543d017a5f|I've never been great at conflict resolution.
8f1e5370-076c-4a65-b570-1eb1e7e90da6|You know, maybe try the copying machine.
e82230e8-e603-4097-b33b-9c145f7e1b54|Which means this one must be the copy.
a83642c9-c217-4301-a251-d953fdb72abe|Did you make other copies?
a9c816a3-8610-42ca-8098-8d503622ce03|When you're finished, drop off a copy for me.
e274591b-7476-4d8b-a4ca-1b901ea8b8bd|I know you have a copy.
917ebcbb-ac97-4513-bbfb-20fed85c4c2d|They didn't have enough wings.
150c0baf-4739-40dd-90d5-bef2ac4944e1|They got a special wing for gay people.
f154918f-4b04-49f0-bed8-e847b61f80b3|Do not hide your head under the wing.
c2d8f164-8492-4b38-95e1-cdd170c84283|But I can be a great wing woman.
b085a911-2588-40f4-b73c-cb2fbef377fa|And why you do this, no doubt.
071a84c8-3a07-42f3-8704-dfee87aad44e|You are beautiful, no doubt of that.
3e3cd081-24d6-43d5-a069-953f40472a33|Any doubts, don't have sex.
3e40759c-8af9-483b-bcef-e466b8d88ef0|I'm just checking for doubts.
0ca274ff-56ba-4a02-9506-f69405d1d8b9|We're just gonna have a bit more fun.
3c2f16e7-83f4-45c1-89cf-5bb277d05a44|You know, I'm having so much fun.
b4ea8aed-7b38-4a1b-b27e-4650a801df8e|Simon's much more fun than my last teacher.
19ac45ea-7fb5-4781-95d2-b27effcf0dc6|And what, miss out on all the fun?
e9e09861-26be-4365-8f24-3aae46517a07|You're a real fun guy, fun guy.
4cd03c82-6d2e-4e53-a95f-11c2fde624cf|She totally knows what's happening.
2c7e3d5c-397d-46c6-8286-542eb10b4903|Not that I'm totally sure I want him back.
0602fca5-ab9c-4fae-9ccf-cc8bb01a4961|I'd totally hang out with you.
b8d05178-22e3-43e3-8166-ec06fec7286f|You guys are totally getting back together.
bcc532c0-56fe-474d-8a41-6898018fc2fa|What if I just poured it out?
07cf39b4-fa70-48a7-b424-3f7bfc630121|Now he pours it all into us.
38bb82a5-9ef5-40c6-b00b-1794bcc7b18b|So, go ahead and pour you some coffee?
9600e748-ed08-438e-92ce-2a9fae637e94|You were only pouring out free drinks.
03c5880d-b72e-49b0-8f51-983c2e84e733|Come pour water so I can wash my hands.
eecccb63-973f-457a-a80f-998a9173aa29|Don't care about their gender, right?
2fe6a1df-c87d-4d06-9db4-c69e4e770555|It's different from gender identity disorder.
65ac0ab6-5e0d-4de8-9ade-6cb4d71d68ba|And you also gave it a gender.
1756ade7-14a9-4535-9c59-e908cce54c3a|You're turning this into a gender debate.
0c7223c9-d476-4e49-b179-783b4d593b3c|He looked so surprised that I would fight back.
a7b89428-5e99-432c-be99-40df65ea3456|I'm not surprised your mother is sick.
12ff0b6b-3a46-4b04-9091-ef0dc3d4104b|It's nothing to be surprised about.
fb07f33d-95ca-4775-8f9c-d7ec555883a3|Don't be too surprised and listen carefully.
a5939a65-9f17-417b-839a-d6a93573c9a2|I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
61e23837-8d38-492a-8a18-1a14a976bf88|Not surprised if it hits you in the face.
774b9e82-b6bc-4387-a8bb-b44a769d634b|I'm just surprised you're here.
fc453e77-e843-4e8f-be7a-9089eef2e744|She surprised us at work.
b2ab272b-98f0-4ecf-bc14-cf93aa39adfc|No, I asked him to get me a beer.
f4a229e7-18b3-42b2-b7a6-dd28884dcfcf|But you two ladies enjoy your light beers.
f1968900-03c4-4806-bcc2-7eeb75e46385|If it wasn't for the beer, Germany would blow.
cf175edb-72f7-4a49-a8b5-bd989966fc90|If you want it cleaned, it's one and six.
04a1e53c-4d7f-429c-b7ab-0643cd36eb35|Jim and I used to clean up at those.
28bd3258-07d3-4d99-877f-61cb1f4b09fa|Maybe I can clean it up.
ba053cba-de06-4d4a-bca0-0002d43603cd|The girl who cleaned my place was my age.
05756b8c-fd14-4262-ba4d-881e50eae578|I told you we'd clean this up.
32887865-57ed-4c8d-b4be-366e13377b48|You know, club owners score mad dates.
bca1df13-fb1a-416f-82a4-d786135a79ba|You think it knows where we can score?
bd9a8066-3a4d-459b-b676-b812a17dce21|Like when she first scored a goal.
dc43a92e-41ec-4006-8eb5-0de41f8eb7b0|My second husband always advised against bonds.
e0cf96c4-6fd1-4bb2-8dd0-554e2769dea5|And that bond stayed strong?
7c46cd0c-c1cf-4953-bc42-34d29334501f|Plus, they hate gay people.
fdbcb0a6-84a6-4950-83d8-dcac184c07f1|Plus, you took him out of school.
78a1db56-84e6-4f58-ab3c-4a6b25122058|Plus, we don't know them.
7eea65fd-2718-4878-bc25-33f990108fad|Plus, you're such a bad actor.
86baec83-ce1c-44ea-ba1e-8114577b490c|If you want your debt paid, take it now.
880c854f-6540-4154-879a-a5b7c4da924f|And people don't buy bad debt.
40ebd7e9-0b1b-4bbe-b97f-11024c9cc3c7|I appear to be in your debt, Fred.
fca7d591-e78e-4ef5-966d-33b767ab1c03|In your debt and at your service.
ad562068-1268-448b-94e6-e43df48764a5|They're smart people who gave good answers.
b5c6b6a4-c88a-4d5b-b321-2edf85e05df3|Oh, I can give him smart water?
8c2995af-ee67-46e2-a8e8-073fafef584d|Well, they did something smart for once.
048708b7-de3f-4001-89b7-269b5cecf8e6|He's kind and funny and smart.
34e9e79a-5a10-49a8-8f84-d63fc80c568a|My english is less terrible than your terrible english.
ff76ea4a-f9d1-48a9-8b2f-15034fdcea4a|Tell her to work on your english.
8b304c22-7abb-4827-87e8-0141fa6e802b|You also know she speaks perfect english?
a615c7cf-33e1-492d-93fe-09dd40e011cc|How do you say in english?
c35a8cc2-6016-4b4a-9d9a-5847041b8e98|What I've written so far is terrible.
345842fe-8876-435e-8361-bb73f9fe4438|I've heard nothing but terrible things.
1e70cf5d-6723-4829-adf6-c8bb891dffd5|I've made a terrible mistake bringing us all here.
c53d60d2-9188-4194-b4c6-36a4c0ffa016|He felt terrible about missing office hours.
2264042d-c15a-4736-b6b2-07a25bf584f7|We have to call another witness.
a9549055-b62f-4805-ba2a-ac39f6d564cd|The witness at my wedding who didn't show up.
9ce7af5e-a6a4-4f0b-b0a2-f2c1270c1988|Okay, looks like that girl is our witness, then.
a8a90bae-f498-4682-a0f1-ceab6add1758|All the witnesses have the same story, all right?
dbfd2b92-2065-4935-8318-4803770f8d73|He has no reference points.
3bf6bdba-423b-46e1-8f52-e1bb8382b67b|You can use me as a reference.
af4711eb-600e-4663-bd01-67bd43d2ffd2|He even gave your name as a reference.
bde150b1-b6e3-4231-ae29-449d7c891d70|Even I forget what this is a reference to.
f8e9dd51-cca0-4d46-87fc-55b3ca708c24|I couldn't account for it.
7e532ce9-ff37-47f8-b54a-ed53c1222d2f|Well, at least everything is accounted for.
31c6bf5d-0f04-42be-bb32-0c03ec4fc511|It would account for all of our memory loss.
2bbc706e-0e3d-4abf-a993-9b668d50f4b2|All present and accounted for, sir.
1b5c278c-065b-4405-b422-21df34981b83|Not even a storm can separate you.
13958b54-ac01-4b36-8b56-12cd1cb60b85|If you can separate the two, so can I.
aebbe3aa-dfc3-441b-939f-1fabed9ece4c|Mean girl, sometimes, no offense.
83d6027c-0d04-45f2-8584-5fb894faa530|The Mean Machine are out in front again!
b9e7123f-b6ff-4800-a22c-6485bc6e1612|Mean people who don't think.
3f93b976-aaf1-434d-8369-276f38f9fd2b|Not many blacks at this school.
07bc606f-c085-4d1f-a259-4312de9485aa|The blacks are being attacked all over the city.
734fef9a-4748-41a9-8984-09dad5fb7b84|Yes, it's a sad story with those blacks.
4a6d88bf-04a6-4123-8360-f3e21dc4bc9a|You should rest, relax a bit.
20081888-6842-4d07-b5c8-e59ae697d4fb|Your father rests his hopes on you.
61c99626-5d76-47ec-8b73-00976ce6e336|Actually, why don't you rest up?
4245dead-8586-4b7c-af53-fcf3a242ad59|If he doesn't rest, he will die.
8666c95c-3d67-4d73-9eed-9914f02569a1|And I can't rest knowing she's out there.
aca7c3bf-fef9-4256-98a2-cb5106a5f855|I'm off to talk to a real hero.
31aedd42-7a59-4f9c-bfc8-089b33a54356|Tell me, Todd, do you consider yourself a hero?
7062b7d3-4a49-45c3-99aa-e5269cdc873e|Oh, you want me to do the hero thing.
513c422d-af2d-4d7f-92bf-64d2f52a21f7|Political process isn't the same as making bombs.
e48917a2-095b-4aa7-996f-e58fe70d3beb|Are you almost ready to set off the bomb?
d87c207c-1abb-428a-bef5-6b973a9f13f6|He's about to set off the bomb.
76b6a461-38ef-490a-b0d8-567b43751d80|Where do you think we found that bomb?
a09e86aa-758b-440c-995e-59f95052af38|I spotted a large weapon down below.
ddc9d3bd-a994-444f-b088-fe85d6b4648e|She was a year below me.
96377c42-30c2-46ba-9fe5-7e3e027c34ca|I'm talking about below the hole.
c0c9ab61-4870-4988-819a-56eedcc69c33|You don't have the ratings broken out?
9d1be765-8d25-4bdb-abec-46de0404fdad|Ratings go down after he declared no Santa?
1f052bd4-9713-4792-bb9c-bb82aa7bd3ef|He doesn't care about ratings because of the money.
dd1b6b8b-da18-41d8-beaf-3840323606e1|Oh, have we got last night's ratings?
d24dca5e-4c40-4e9c-a9c2-54bcbba44cd0|I'm more concerned how the nurses are rating me.
d3a56fc4-dea7-40a4-ac50-c60b83b8cc60|I'm sorry, are you rating them?
c8c91300-35ea-44f0-8629-aa8392034d03|You rating me right now?
0c2411c7-3c4a-4806-93ab-5d762e39d915|Can you not see that I'm busy?
35256cae-bffe-4383-8a32-dd016af728a4|Why'd you call out a busy man?
1937d02e-a6c5-40f5-b6a0-cfb943ac5bf4|I've just been a little bit busy.
6a8007ac-e209-46c8-934b-cca1554b150c|It is important to keep busy.
afedfaf7-0210-4161-ae42-7a636730fbca|And he doesn't cite one case on point.
2f96626e-6593-4b76-ab08-887462a0991f|Every other case, they get cited by the mayor.
373de685-5034-4543-ad6d-c14637d0e295|She cited religion as the cause?
c8d83983-9bbd-4d1b-bf5f-e71f0f0664f6|That man seems to be everywhere.
90fd86fd-943c-43fb-85ab-62c09776962f|There was blood everywhere, and I just screamed.
d76b848e-8b5a-434d-acf3-45c5477010e2|There were bits and pieces everywhere.
431c649f-8389-47c7-b709-3d29e3c5a46f|I've been searching for her everywhere.
df799f1c-4af4-4ac1-b38e-d9b96108956a|They are still here, in this soil.
9db8770d-c6c6-41e1-b881-aa552029b758|I'm a British citizen on British soil.
72d572b0-5a75-45d4-846c-59e1233d2e3c|Now imagine they're made of water instead of soil.
fc1d22db-5794-4585-9f8e-b8a00dd2f8c2|My blood belongs here, in this red soil.
c2299318-e4ad-49e1-a5d8-4e3043db72e8|I think I saw them earlier on the highway.
998e6053-b333-4604-acda-8f877bad43c3|A highway and a park named after him?
e4583298-6485-4873-90be-13a23a986003|I'm not in the right frame of mind.
279ab45d-936d-4f1d-8594-d27ca2382bd2|You only see it for a couple of frames.
4ef352a8-395f-40dd-bb32-ab2f40487d80|What are you trying to do, frame me?
65a7d803-2f6e-497f-bdc4-be4eb2b62866|Come on, I'm just stretching my legs here.
bbbc5253-3f8a-40ce-972a-487d9a8987a5|We can really stretch out, you know?
a8597363-111c-4cbf-8f86-b12d455e2aa1|I might stretch my legs.
342e4d5c-9036-486a-99af-9c1e2047a6a4|See, that's 'cause you don't stretch.
e8e26bc6-d08a-4f23-b507-13a2af8fb965|That's what I'm opposing with this.
83eed490-4315-4515-9e39-4f4f099ec408|What, normal as opposed to gay?
95d9a507-9031-4bdb-b1cf-49d0c1221fb3|You are the only one who opposes it.
915fbddd-a341-4351-93de-dc9dfc43c209|You've very opposed by me.
8dd68b89-9772-4259-a289-11585b99a196|You brought a Catholic girl home to your mother?
3b307163-0e91-42f0-a2cf-adbca1afb10c|The oldest Catholic church in Rome.
f17f0336-d8fb-4931-a6ff-6f660dcb3195|Oh, yeah, well, we got the initial results.
e8390803-161d-49d8-985e-c3250912ef55|Initial here to acknowledge that you've returned your key.
d927abab-f2a0-46db-bc3a-790800ba9676|Initial reports suggest she started the fire.
21fa288e-4766-4bf0-9572-1c99b1b03ab8|There are many variables, but it can succeed.
e1e47f59-53e9-4804-a525-6d307a9a8fa7|Okay, but we have to control the variables.
46360d6c-6715-42b2-8d7c-8b57f2e827c7|Too many variables for someone this controlled.
4ec1d3ce-1bb0-41cb-a862-5260236b2499|It is essential that we remember that.
3776e653-4ce2-44e2-bfa9-7958f989a61d|Look, it's not like your role is essential.
83c00a50-b50a-4cb6-8f6e-923671677e58|I want to know what is essential to life.
e2f9f85f-e571-4ca5-bb06-5fd948486e70|But now, the stars have finally been made essential.
27851892-1bba-4756-ba89-fb013e7db144|The essential thing is that you're alive.
2874004b-ee69-409d-a2ce-86edab7963cd|He returned last night from his travels.
05b4a28a-0e7f-4678-9c8b-ffab2bd35486|No travel plans, no enemies, no money troubles.
45a2dc0c-4bf6-41fa-830a-fd6945a6cd9f|Who travels by train anymore?
6cb6dabb-d4c9-4cd4-8bda-bceead660588|Oh, good news travels fast.
e01dea80-49ff-40ad-bfad-b93660e10e4b|They had a soft opening two months ago.
f2bc4a75-c511-465c-b102-70d0dd0018a8|I am not the one opening the door.
a7c38074-7b3e-4872-b260-9c2381c27c36|All other ships, go for that opening.
e7970c45-b302-46e2-b357-059769e205d8|We may have a little opening right here.
2af1c017-4760-44e2-9847-abe2633d55cc|You should have told me you were a nurse.
24b28a20-24d2-4238-aefe-ddb1a40f5505|All I wanted was that nurse gone.
c9f04f7d-09ac-4913-81f7-b440f1fd63a0|I hear you caused another incident last night.
b5a2b01b-58b8-4315-81ef-b53b50d7edff|Do you remember where the incident took place?
13bbc8ba-9a86-4d79-b5ec-1ee4394d4746|There have been incidents, haven't there, Sarah?
2e1f4d4c-8def-4907-aefd-26c5ab0be14e|You were both arrested for the same incident.
3e745b8b-1053-47b8-b5f6-849efda9cc85|I said a bad movie, not an abortion.
c19d7cd2-02c9-4275-8ef6-cde137f7d962|But you're for abortion, right?
4d028f0d-f0db-4e48-9aab-4cd20dc328a3|Are you saying I should get an abortion?
c8f4b986-a6a8-43c7-a7ef-68220ab5875b|You told her to get an abortion.
32f440a9-ea52-405e-976e-214b66798593|If you need an abortion, you'd better get one.
b6317fa8-401c-4507-9d30-b094fca60823|He divided the money so it's harder to track.
7dbe1f4d-deb1-465f-a352-65704466a116|To divide a human being in two?
0338351e-6bc6-4822-bf21-8691e1335a16|I know most fans are pretty divided.
e98f2a6a-dbd7-432b-a23a-ee9e9c236b12|We're not headed into the storm divide on foot.
7e16f9cb-97ed-49ae-b42a-173060d459f3|That's what I'm aiming for.
717196c5-fa2e-4335-ae10-c097b5e259af|We're aiming to buy him out.
91c02dd8-d0fc-4120-9e36-6b7e546409b9|It's not their eyes I'm aiming for.
336ff214-684c-4526-93d7-f631ad8fc895|That's why I aimed at your water bottle.
7a8046b9-03e1-46cb-a9ba-f2393fdbf13c|How do you aim to do that?
670d93cf-5792-4616-afc0-54fc455a6dae|Your mom used to see how tired I was.
06a4c0ba-fbf7-48c1-b2bf-1af9cf63e8eb|Aren't you tired of it, yet?
43fd1134-2eb4-490d-bf04-92773b6120cd|There's a chair over there if you get tired.
6c3be765-af1f-42b0-ae4c-58f92279dbe0|No, I wasn't just tired.
e43170d1-f149-40b4-8368-6b0a0d9c0886|You're late and I'm tired.
b6df792d-9bc3-4a90-b55c-4f28d33a72c6|Now, look, I'm tired of talking.
46887ef6-ce2e-4e1e-8f9e-43714ed2b9fa|You should be careful of his sharp teeth.
d739142d-189c-4ebb-b8d5-35b305ff11a9|Keep a careful watch on him.
f478439e-6b3f-4a11-b239-66520ca6415c|Be careful with this stuff.
d12b0cc1-f1d1-4107-8ddf-c61ccc4ae29b|We do have enough to question him, though.
92b87a34-eb16-4f70-add3-7e6c3766c759|Ethan Bernard, no record, and Billy's questioning him now.
a3ebcea7-f293-4cd7-b85c-1f52f80a4abd|Don't question me Just get it!
2d27a7bb-7aba-45bb-9c87-749a3324c93f|You can't question him without the judge.
da5b11d8-6094-40a1-9cd8-6935854c0b0f|Why are you questioning him?
3479e3c7-2146-41c4-a4c8-f24001679168|And it's a real cheap one.
c598d069-53b1-4439-a84c-9962dca90165|Maybe we should move somewhere cheaper.
930ddabf-4a38-4b50-907e-62b060400d84|I only bought you a cheap ring.
4fa85e23-a0e2-435f-bfe2-88f2c730bdd0|Oh, they're cheap, all right.
7fccf45d-a3cd-449c-b2d3-48db1eff95e0|The guns were cheap, so we bought them.
bc9dbef7-f9f1-4687-a034-008b303d5593|Well, it would have, but that's beside the point.
b5ca83ec-ce63-44ac-b9f9-6710236eeef0|He may have fought beside these men.
87dacc6d-5c57-4a54-a280-42e8257b6989|He says he has fought beside me.
8f54297a-074f-439f-b554-5dc985e47248|I fought beside him a couple of times.
7d78009e-b297-40f6-b2f4-9b40803dd1c2|That I existed, that I once walked beside you.
01f29fc6-1e97-4de5-a1d3-861553f30d01|This is all going to come apart.
5c512ed5-19ea-4f30-b653-8316af36aa8c|Stop giving me things that come apart.
595217b2-72f8-421b-ab05-188525db6cd9|You really can't tell us apart?
77e700b9-7cd4-437c-bdfa-b48a5c74fc53|Don't you see you're falling apart?
e587cd84-7e4c-4e72-9496-b694b6766614|How many years are you apart in age?
389a6d13-a6b1-41ad-8f93-e96c88cbe6bc|You better not drop my future criminal partner.
31a989e7-9586-4338-a893-70184b77e0d0|You already have a criminal past.
64465b3e-1781-4ae8-80a0-dc3e43634997|I employ men I expect to get it right.
da786263-b3cb-4746-a4e8-73d94fafea85|I'm not employed here any more.
a017565c-9a01-4902-8c23-b96f492a4ccc|How many people do you employ here?
8654b3da-9d8a-4be2-932e-eaa107d0c486|Look how it's rushing out.
a69a449f-2bad-403d-9685-1025a89dac62|I mean maybe he feels rushed into it too.
301d3f98-ea53-4825-bd22-f867a0c9b93d|And if they rush us?
f9cc203a-7455-4f17-850f-67917b2649fc|We don't like to rush it.
755c26fa-b358-47f8-a024-37445a3d1db9|The daily active users are up, way up.
e11018e4-459f-4639-b842-cb6165b7e759|Is he implying that I'm a drug user?
77a76b33-eeb3-4a2a-9c1c-350cdc620bf3|At the moment, all we have are user handles.
da1afe75-d862-4492-b35b-b37aa6b3da60|It gives him the upper hand.
32d3bda4-de07-473c-b9a1-75df71ed3df1|We're under fire from the upper floors.
da741a09-d26a-477d-93c4-cb6dc69a49a3|Are there any pay phones on the upper floors?
034f75f5-42fe-455e-b167-91d71fc664e7|There's no upper right arm.
4093932c-0056-47f0-b12f-f424f7d4ff72|This year, there is no winner.
eafc10e9-6f51-45d2-87e1-bbebd7fd03c0|You can always tell the winners.
c1468a3d-2fdc-40d8-bd08-07705aacda45|He can refuse nothing to the winners.
f95f7342-7333-4e13-93cb-a5125f62448e|But there was a clear winner.
a1e0b3a8-0184-4ce0-a532-4a2da8d71cee|I just wanted to say that you're all winners.
4c672bff-9b2a-40f0-b7d2-4e7f51cbf638|Every animal here depends on another in some fashion.
aa478f20-648c-4958-a277-df0f31fa3754|He complains I care for nothing but fashion.
32ee0484-531e-4b74-98b7-9a0a64e55a96|I hope it doesn't become a fashion.
bf744cf6-8801-40fc-b94d-2c2c6ea82993|You want to see a fashion show?
32a5a35f-118b-4045-8dbf-235ad10947d2|Is there anything I like about fashion?
5458dbab-6eca-4947-ac24-aedb6bb4da96|That depends on how much you're gonna tip me.
a5de7b98-07d6-49b6-9291-4d0b5951fcbc|Let me give you a tip, sugar bear.
a112801f-6637-44c6-8239-3ebf3ae33634|I'm just gonna give him a few tips.
ff13365a-2cb1-4d44-ac48-d6403044079b|I bet that you have some great tips.
a6c49ab9-c48d-4a67-b40b-2f463ad4a0f2|Do you mind if I have an apple?
5df7af24-287b-4622-bb69-5a02c11029af|Well, the apples don't fall far from the tree.
bcb05ec8-ace2-425a-b560-301a8f5b2c12|I'm just getting you an apple.
8dd2fa6a-3dae-448d-8216-4769a4b63bf0|She just wanted to eat an apple.
37bb0842-1bb2-4261-b3aa-838afcf5f47e|You seem like a man on the rise.
dbbbb0d5-ae7a-4d5e-ad8f-f14949700aab|My, what a rise your people have made.
0a78cb52-56b8-475b-90eb-f7652b55cf3f|I've got a vast amount of work on.
78b3f9d9-40c7-4c40-9f86-a9ea301146ec|They remembered a green world, vast and beautiful.
f97974a9-fd3b-40bc-8d62-86ecc9ee6564|It's only for a limited time.
6823c61f-3aab-49a0-b9cf-c62818363b4d|There are only a limited number at present.
949eeffc-6a67-4f98-9d1c-ff36f22a4377|I don't think it's limited to there.
c0937c86-c4aa-44b0-9184-ff40331215fc|I said I'd cover you for a limited period.
edf7b1ee-d047-4dc5-915d-6a9417a6317a|What you've done for me was enormous.
beb90ddd-4d7b-4b3e-975f-bae383a297f4|Turning against the moon exposes you to enormous risk.
67541ffc-f877-431c-bd73-89f799231ad5|At enormous cost, we've avoided disaster, and are recovering.
2ad2dba7-24f9-491d-9aa0-982e995dce68|All we got is enormous black guys.
617dfff5-a539-4bab-aec4-c3a53db3b9f4|I've only ever done package holidays.
dbb0520d-a747-4c26-a876-806bb3c98659|Remember him visiting us once on October holidays?
f46cdc7d-a89c-4cc6-aef3-ca26a5beb694|We were on holiday in Italy.
e11bc389-b492-42fc-b125-e2a706742657|If you'll be at home on holiday.
eb016bc0-47a8-4225-ae91-fcd76b228c3e|It's time he had a holiday.
91c73b11-002a-4452-ac86-83aa74afbed0|That is the point that I wanted to emphasize.
12c82622-7479-4428-b00d-5180cfafbd1f|I really want to emphasize this.
2644167b-b4ac-4946-943a-fe8f899a2caa|So as to emphasize your point.
0d7a8d45-0848-4731-a075-5da0586ec2b0|When did I ever emphasize it?
39650479-8912-4dd8-bf9f-15716c4e9bd0|He was merely keeping an eye on it.
ee7b4b36-d20d-49fa-b82b-2615441ac122|It's merely a place where humans happen to live.
7c44c92c-54d4-4a61-ae4d-b48f130756da|This is merely a sentencing hearing.
ee7930db-86ed-47a7-8d0c-72fcb777bca0|Let's see if you can dance.
a995c220-18f1-4421-9181-6919cc96b0f2|This is where we dance.
9c5174a1-248b-4cee-a0b3-573fd3b5cc1e|Do you want me to dance?
e9f2c825-2bc5-439c-aa5a-2171649c18f6|If he dances with the girls I won't.
7cd53a9e-de0d-4c6c-bee9-c399d7f3ad93|I can change the very core of me.
37118c03-adbf-40c4-b569-7491ad3b46b4|I was thinking I had better core strength.
c7b01ca0-9b4e-4cf5-b1ab-3874801a1002|His core temperature is changing too quickly.
a769f58f-6c6b-4d4e-8352-0ec4834fbb86|I work out my core.
d11ee3e0-2a2b-4e66-8ded-4677f64f21ab|There's nothing that matches anything we know.
6b931ff0-092d-4f6c-bed8-eb6db774f5ab|They are very well matched.
9ed06794-2fa5-4c1e-b55d-9b2355c53f98|We matched them to ones on the toys.
245718aa-7a97-4be9-a834-009688c05728|But the medical landscape has changed.
f15d020a-ee0c-4181-988c-36b3a31f3d82|How do you feel overall, generally with your health?
299c0bb9-a75a-4d99-9069-ca2375c6a193|And no reflection on your overall health.
0858499f-b0b2-4ca8-aee6-ca1ac9525616|It was just an overall feeling.
0129329a-e4a9-4410-98ca-c279ac840b8f|Okay, what are your overall impressions of this woman?
9288fddf-1ff9-432c-9cf2-c8e68f21feed|She hates when you play golf.
a042de41-6e62-4166-b05d-3dab1d85bb37|Frank got held up at the golf course.
a10db1eb-d60a-4641-bc8e-2facf85e5dc1|When have you ever seen me play golf?
29c8a32d-005b-4695-a89e-2e29c5397c92|You play golf with him.
a5df4a8e-6d6c-4848-b970-f137b0d6e16e|The company's owner is lacking in good customer service.
ffad4908-c058-48c3-9ec3-2e60d03f8111|I find myself lacking in both.
e236a463-cdb0-4142-aeb6-fb9a54ff49b8|With war, we lack men.
d9c4892a-1601-4e90-b7b4-05ab8b74b704|There's virtually no crime left in our society.
2344a066-4dc4-4ad2-b117-151016c0e60e|I know virtually nothing about my secretary here.
8d4e130f-241b-47b7-9d83-74f3bc801e6a|She told me it was virtually empty.
ab2b6ad3-c516-4dbb-b349-13594ee8cfaf|He's giving the whole route, all his moves.
8de7d817-78e0-4492-8bf7-e527c54d09d6|Is it possible to change the route now?
ab4e6cda-1b54-4cc1-a317-88c5cf01a8bc|I got to get some blood flowing.
55a495e2-c356-4307-a2b8-b1df4a1c8324|Can you just go with the flow for once?
35eb797a-017e-4361-8735-9183a536b648|I wanted it went along with the flow.
5d1dd465-5bea-4c98-891a-22d019deb70b|And feel my power flow into you!
e075592e-9754-4251-9094-ba036b59fa0d|Have her follow the main cable.
a132467b-d0bd-4cc4-9763-3791322dc06d|You cut those cables, you cut their power.
9e298c8a-3754-43f8-9367-e4bce5c876f1|I started, and then it was on cable.
ee4ca117-a34b-4fdd-a8c1-20cab552f570|The cable, do you know where it is?
f5df1449-c18a-4eb2-9c0b-90155956f228|I finally got past the gate.
5411b0aa-8cb3-46a5-8f88-01b100fd4e62|That nice young man at the gate took it.
8680ff85-3506-4194-9a67-45799e49b8eb|Well bury the gate, don't worry.
98efb025-8032-4c6f-8307-d863a53597e4|Open the gate now, or we will all die!
e78f44d5-e19e-4805-ab61-c5de8bf3fe58|Could someone close the garden gate for us?
2edbe852-6c47-4fe8-bc78-d5c110236e52|I'm not going to wear ties anymore.
51fc1d6b-b289-4265-b27d-f572c53aaabe|Do you know why I'm wearing this tie?
43970792-0e1f-446c-855f-ebc4dc3c5b32|The one with the tie isn't bad.
2ecbb52e-7c78-4f79-8fe5-1911286ff97a|Walking the floor, not really working, wearing a tie.
24449a50-7389-4f5a-8d82-d1fb523f6403|Well, don't get him a tie.
c7fe62e2-9130-40b7-b3fa-5c77c2b630c9|I'm sure you'll do us proud.
21ca2f80-b2ac-46fe-a911-4a8cb9b317e5|I think Jane would be quite proud of me.
30d1cfa1-5fc7-4861-9d66-7f35b4792348|The only one I'm proud of is this one!
56ee5cfa-c1e8-4a69-ace9-bd0b748c5f6d|Your brother would have been very proud.
82de1713-6781-490d-8027-048b0ea31983|Meg, I want you to promise me.
a772cdfc-20ef-4833-8617-3053b42d59c0|I made that promise to him.
5c22680f-3354-44d6-901e-7a688f8251a2|Well, I can promise you it'll never happen again.
abe8aea7-c09f-4c4c-a134-436b6d480086|However, they didn't keep that promise.
082c3a85-440d-432f-bcb9-ed3ca4e02015|I want you to promise me you'll destroy it.
490f8a33-e040-4d46-8c10-b8fb9875223a|Okay, so let's get down to some hot dish.
41061421-e34c-4a30-9d77-69d4710dd393|What would I want with a satellite dish?
8afd7d0b-c4b4-4507-bef7-ca5383a95b1e|Don't you have deeper dishes?
88c1b441-6408-41d5-9213-627b3331129e|You don't do the dishes at home.
f186204d-1626-4253-8685-ccaea8d46b39|The sky, and everything beneath it.
cfe5698f-f1d1-48e4-8c6e-8ad236eef868|Let's see what's beneath the surface.
2c96790d-e0ee-4c6f-9a3b-81fed13c259f|Oh, I think you'll find nothing's beneath me.
5feff279-ca70-4237-b45a-2918eec3dd5a|Yes, it is beneath me!
0757284a-b167-4ff2-bfd9-b73fb58604b3|One with increased range and fire power.
e01f5c65-2d41-4ae2-87c7-c60447563a46|The young officers listened with increased attention.
f56f90e2-638f-43a2-8402-6915cefaa7a0|We have noticed a lot of increased traffic.
abf08b50-6070-42ea-83c3-e3ad7ed618f1|I just want you to succeed this time.
4dd7edaf-9ee8-4a44-9afc-823f421c6eb4|You've tried, but you haven't succeeded.
501eaee0-9fb8-4015-a9f6-9e9ce8f4c709|And as far as he knows, he succeeded.
b6cab96f-5a21-4f0c-8463-e99a9dbbce57|And no one could have succeeded by now?
c1639306-e492-4ea6-8bc7-1d8eb4d49ce7|I've barely even got started yet.
1b36e43d-7299-46c7-88b2-5c5e791f1b6f|I could barely see to complete my mission.
3e713a76-0e84-418f-97e3-93bab84fc432|You can barely walk, much less run.
00eb5df3-f0b2-493f-90a0-8eef88d8e66a|Well, like I told you, we barely know him.
e08e1db9-76a9-4c3f-9893-1cc5fefec0e6|He can barely remember his own name.
9038f43e-bc12-4cc2-b80a-ba48a3225fac|It seems very narrow, Sarah!
63a6c16f-287a-4851-b72a-329b6fc136e1|It kept me on the straight and narrow.
ab2f29a4-8bdc-4b9e-85f7-521b3a68a893|Just do me a solid, Bill.
be73e358-d827-4a1c-9ee6-192520dc1ba3|We've got a great, solid signal.
e75a89e8-6ec5-4d13-812b-aaf214206f25|Three, the case against him looks pretty solid.
f0c5b448-461d-4a5d-a331-ec1c99cb4561|It'd give you time to build a solid case.
d8b2d4a8-16c9-4b9f-88bd-89325f3d4328|They actually seemed like a pretty solid couple.
ad30aabc-2e32-4949-a5f8-57f7a0e53738|She was accusing me of things that weren't true.
3847937b-1e00-4c07-9834-f65ecce5b7f6|George accused me of seeing him behind his back.
4ec2d206-3398-4f50-9d60-fa7ed64e36a0|No one will be accused without evidence.
fa0bb91f-08c5-4f7c-845e-116d56cf5a91|She says she's going to accuse her mother.
aa5f7268-13d0-4ef7-b2ac-d24d7c536f12|You ever been accused of something you never did?
956288c3-2611-488a-8a19-4cc03de80e62|Go see if it caught anything useful.
290acf04-54c8-4669-8f86-b2ba34f190ef|Because you make yourself useful.
d8a69fbc-277e-474d-9b72-bf7bf8c90a32|Natalie: Maybe make more noise!
f7060cfb-3ade-4e6e-8493-90fa76476116|I hear some noise within.
9c3203a5-545e-41ff-8f96-117c840aa327|Make a noise and you're dead.
bbfa45db-b36c-4cd8-980e-d09cb219861d|Do you always make that noise when you sleep?
466ac918-75ad-4be7-869f-4b95f246f021|All right, expose his chest.
c20acf5c-26c4-4d88-8169-fe8e36449f86|As long as they expose his position.
b06ef2b9-127d-4904-92c8-5ceee25e3a34|We won't have it exposed.
25fef770-1eef-437e-bc31-2b9219b47dcc|It's just like at mass.
d22f29a2-d87d-423c-a005-f0bf29caeb37|Unless you'd rather be out there with the masses.
cc5fb8d2-bd0e-4260-a843-9dc6aa56a209|Why didn't you go to mass today?
13ebc104-7a87-452a-9637-49d7cadacced|We had this reading at last Sunday's mass.
7323f015-541c-4116-90a0-287bf7c90559|You've given me multiple chances.
8c99bbd3-80eb-4b25-aa7d-d12fa0ff49d5|Yelling his way to multiple life sentences?
89783935-bb89-45f0-95e5-ca124aa71119|Was it one facility or multiple targets?
a59821d4-f096-40d4-93f7-99a8159d8f53|I need more hot seeds.
74b06454-a8d2-416d-8d66-0fc4f3eb353c|All we want is your seed.
1eef60b6-a621-4a17-839b-d57de5d1a294|I found the seeds you were looking for.
9bce46e5-d6a8-4506-959e-00651cfaedbf|Let me take his seed.
d77ce438-65f8-4d12-9421-0ec8ddd55f21|Yeah, I did, but then he rejected me.
b674db60-fb8b-4b24-b169-f8c9e46624aa|I've just never been rejected like that before.
66254ced-68e1-4ae8-84d7-36519e7996da|I was afraid you would reject me.
c7d4bca1-812c-4c56-a46f-8cc134d81399|They were rejected seven times.
1f0abe9f-2af8-4b88-afb8-fdf506038144|It's your right to decline, of course.
0a8e3f89-ba31-42f9-a0fb-9a37e344e3f6|He signed the form declining police protection.
cfa11756-b8e9-46fc-b23a-11bded7df9e9|He has no reason to decline.
39e6a465-2388-45dc-9423-4c8f71e5b663|You told me yesterday your client declined to testify.
fc359603-8ba1-45a2-9d30-19512fb42ba4|You know, your little hair hat there.
fe2570de-b3cd-4b5c-8621-396671299b7b|I'm not throwing my hat in the ring.
f8a5133f-6279-4f5a-9e3d-d9cfd30bb4cf|And don't you ever touch my hat again.
bd966ff3-27b5-43b2-9408-18aca8f38a8f|This is my lucky hat.
ad5bdb7a-d2b0-4eb3-a297-01c04799c8d5|Either way, I will help you.
3ef7b104-c1a6-48d8-8518-fb43f4a8c480|Well, either way, we need to know who is.
6105f0c0-1083-45db-8011-fa3638fce96f|Either you're for us or you're against us.
8773a7e8-f7d2-4cd9-b08d-02e7ebaaca79|Either it's me or her.
1aa6ace2-d53a-499e-b401-b5f370d45587|This isn't a dream either, is it?
9ba08da4-e790-464c-92c5-8fa0149fd311|It's either him or us.
eab519f5-5873-4fcb-a33a-9c6ff5c5c78c|I will protect your secret if you leave today.
7f656c63-95b2-43ec-bd64-b557a185cb24|It was a secret buried long ago.
c39db983-24a9-4587-b1c0-fef45e334aad|How was your secret meeting?
d6404bda-8446-4c21-89ca-d1259ce17e07|She had this special coat with massive pockets.
a66f3f2d-6ec0-47f7-8cf3-9fcba2ae2041|Yes well, massive attack said the same thing.
64826330-1af5-42f8-994a-7eea17dbe1da|Yesterday he had a massive heart attack.
fcbc61df-21e9-4014-b447-9c8e536c80dd|This is a massive week for me at work.
a09be78e-0a1b-4135-8a42-c0403454f16e|I was about to make this massive commitment.
d4a57604-124b-4094-8430-b827257b0795|What good is eating grass like this?
a495baca-22f9-4d43-b8e5-9f20f95f2787|I put in grass and leaves from the park.
58c340e8-302b-4add-9669-5c9453b3ab6f|Because I was selling grass to your wedding guests?
dbe61bd1-0e94-4b8d-9126-3b32b574279a|They all think I'm a grass because of you.
97e408c2-e562-4cb7-8d8d-f394061e7044|It was definitely fun to be out there.
e0982e7f-6283-4eec-b3a0-b27874fdcca6|We'll definitely talk about that.
d06b0c61-2430-4228-8634-cf93e0ef6a5b|He's a liberal, he's like you and me.
857025db-3927-409a-8d93-4041e6d8d904|I know today thinking is much more liberal.
2f5773a1-39c3-4ff0-9455-207fbb05ea02|I don't like that, too liberal.
d6219985-f039-4bad-991a-6bdeb984fa52|Although they've been very liberal with us.
fcf713ff-b62f-42c2-8711-fe5f646326f1|I'm gonna go stir the sauce.
6c2d9eda-c239-4755-b43c-298ade46a257|Before I went and stirred everything up.
8c01d83c-f68b-490a-9589-0a44cefed119|That must have stirred things up.
5b8c1b3c-fd75-4f29-8392-faa30de7f66d|He was in his element, stirring it up.
a55558d9-2a9e-4c4d-adaa-2b4dfca05cde|The captain gave me your number.
e2003066-08bb-4776-b3f1-1bd843661e0a|I'll be captain of the first team.
dc3e428a-c7b6-4a32-b125-921cb7c23d87|I want to talk to your captain.
822856f0-c695-4653-a46f-40f109ad96e8|No one has been killed, captain.
24df5bba-d36a-4413-8f45-688059d4db5d|You're going to join him your beautiful Captain!
5c44dd8c-ff7f-485a-ae6c-fc942d96c798|There is a revolution going on here.
71f30a77-79f0-48d5-be83-934761b91ad9|We could have a revolution here.
9687b936-3214-4c34-861c-3f874bf076b0|And so was the revolution made!
a228809c-af57-4330-a8bc-6871194c82ff|Before the revolution began, we were soft and weak.
30dcdea7-ffdd-44bf-bdc0-1de7b2752898|Why do you want this revolution so much?
9f19024c-1605-4e9f-9334-8bb09146b323|The material is typically used in household products.
cfe08df7-262f-48d8-95e4-f031a57773f5|That's not something one typically walks away from.
8e2ac8f8-4a03-4c2a-8649-885854154e98|Everything that followed is typically what follows.
3d947bb9-3332-476f-ac15-a8aac2e4aa60|It typically involves only one sense, such as sight.
12518276-4f56-4bbc-a2e3-d3c11adeeaca|You see, that is just so typically me.
e603e772-7ccb-48c7-a74a-bb93fcbe64b8|Three One, solid on our sector.
53909012-aa81-4cae-84a5-29b157591b7d|Sir, enemy ships are approaching from sector nine.
f03064cd-a99f-452a-8ab2-d84786a5d6a2|No more job means no more sector pass.
e937c62a-4dc7-4816-aaf8-d03badb92ba7|Still concerned about handing him over?
1ca8f355-e6cd-4d3b-ba7b-60cd907332dc|I handed you this business and I abandoned you.
4510d7bf-426d-4ad6-b4e4-b366946e3b00|He handed it to me as I left.
92c656d3-f2b8-4926-8cc0-5faa4788d70c|And you're handing them both over to me?
d0094f72-86ae-494b-bf2e-41f7f55283b0|I have just been handed this.
5acdc385-2421-44e2-a410-aeb6c0ea121c|Then I don't approve of you stealing that.
bb338c66-9d70-46f5-b269-4227da1a3cf5|I don't approve of parents buying such things.
7ecc73d7-c906-40a3-8545-8f9ff441703a|Amy, this isn't the photo that we approved.
acf50f19-c220-4211-bc80-f328953ab951|I just didn't think that Lucas would approve.
ae5ff7dd-81a0-4aaf-acea-eb05e5c37a0a|He didn't believe you was my uncle.
932e9fd6-7242-464c-9959-cf29301e2057|In fact, he doesn't have an uncle at all.
026375b3-3ca5-4c76-825c-ac6b658479ee|I'm sorry about your uncle, Brian.
1130341a-89cb-4d35-a0f0-17b0fec0ad9a|Need a little more volume up top.
4f31ed40-da85-4603-85ff-d4990ac1cbfc|As the sun goes down, the volume goes up.
fdb023f3-45a8-41c6-9431-2093f46bc5e0|If we can get his volume up, he'll go.
e385d4e9-9358-421b-9faf-33f96523c589|We need to raise his blood volume.
2458d313-a0da-4741-836e-c1b7c1af779c|It's a death sentence for the kid.
b4ea8891-5c42-49ae-b309-c3d00bc4d21b|This time sentence will be carried out.
632fc35e-fc99-42b8-ba29-4968a6e05e69|In that case, we will move on to sentencing.
7d1828eb-dde5-4f0b-858b-a743e12e5554|And when I escaped, it got left behind.
15a3bb21-0d2c-4c4e-9f58-cb70aea23fce|What's better than escaping by reading ?
c91bc3d2-6544-4769-b4e2-31c457790b3d|I saw him escape with my own eyes.
c965a6b6-25f7-42b4-afbd-4d0b675092b4|What makes you say she escaped.
2daa93dc-ce87-4292-8bee-3cc19468fc4d|Nothing seemed unusual about it to me.
85d6788e-15e1-4161-b4bc-c70e992deded|There anything unusual going on in his life?
a9fd2a60-635c-457c-b66c-41bd09c689fe|Look, we all know this is an unusual situation.
0394eef5-d91a-4bf4-aee2-c9f0e30a159e|How unusual when you think about it.
a2186896-b388-44a7-a9ee-336dd002976b|It's gonna be rural, hidden away.
d7f0591a-2344-4391-8aaf-62ed35750705|Oh, it was very rural, very pretty.
4aee23d7-977f-4494-9695-af4fc8be5f7f|I grew up in a rural area.
b091b842-c12b-46e8-960f-ec503444c4d3|No, actually, used to be a rural area.
83a26ad0-aa00-48a3-83d3-4c200961b256|Don't they still do it in rural?
275c7bef-07e4-49f0-8003-46a41e2f4d06|Next time, I'll be certain to cast him.
a69e60a7-c490-40c2-91e0-07c78b090023|Why would anyone cast her out for that reason?
c2b11a59-2128-48db-bfc1-2bdd6236a416|You want me to cast us off?
1ddd7801-ad35-4631-99a7-544354b9fd38|I mean, you cast a pretty big shadow.
56f0aa54-ece5-459a-83e0-1bdca07adbfc|And you're casting a pretty big shadow.
8ab6ba93-bded-4098-87d0-1b0d9fbcb6cf|How many drinks do you have a day?
c78979ac-b9dc-4d52-8214-18eba31fe332|Can I get either of you a drink?
83583f59-81f0-40af-ac80-59b16c7b6124|It's time for your drink, come on!
164296ba-d0c3-464f-b455-db3a75b81c6b|If somebody's done that, you take a drink.
d567ab2d-ef75-443f-b914-29a9a2538701|You getting your drink on here?
7950934b-5553-4636-bb69-b5c7993d3bb6|None of us are getting any sleep tonight.
dbd70ecd-c714-400f-a63e-5eedb1637f6f|What you need is some sleep.
24004b94-597e-44f3-90f5-d380e878e4ae|See how much sleep you get then.
c180b4ca-1284-438a-890b-657bc2e17d97|I grew up in a household with this man.
a7dbf904-40db-489f-b50d-f29b4eccbfcb|What is the total value of your household assets?
88f9b79c-3a84-4bca-91d3-f8d709081836|I don't think there's anything to celebrate.
8be28504-500a-4d9e-b34a-8d66f0a70cf7|I thought we were here to celebrate your birthday.
d0c6f7f4-2c2c-41cc-a7e4-5f40335618a3|Well, you two seem to have the same taste.
0fdb4be9-a24b-4b77-aa95-28e8664bef76|I have better taste than that.
edcb55c0-b143-49e4-b47b-e5cfbe8b3464|He set up a tasting at my house tomorrow.
4f225899-8c3d-4e0e-b1b1-c2dc2bd6dc02|One taste and you'll know.
5591c13f-8a42-4b5c-839d-e2439e5b2897|Actually, I know your tastes.
41ba47bf-dac0-40f3-bb4c-bdd1bceecc3a|I'll take this on outside and eat it there.
142f55cf-fecf-47db-8e73-25a9624a1fd6|Maybe we should talk outside.
10efac91-54d9-4960-9ee6-ca6173efc16e|Take your brother and go outside.
4c4c1b4f-0c21-4d48-b60c-dac9a7beb549|It was always an outside chance.
638af4ad-8488-4fce-93be-360035cbb901|How we acquired it is beside the point.
34ec9589-1abf-43c9-b328-8d10a8acc742|Never acquired a taste for it.
23fd2280-ced4-4dc0-9c08-351b1e5be85a|Did you acquire some new abilities in your travels?
4c14fbdd-bb90-4266-8e49-9249b58028cb|Well, as you can see, I've been acquiring assets.
0bddfea9-db25-4b19-bf61-ccb04196d420|What did you acquire through training ?
2447e37b-0244-47a4-9d05-9fd6e79ea424|How closely do you work with John?
74ab4963-f765-4e02-a11e-b528bb7bde70|I follow his progress very closely.
afb8423f-d99d-4138-8af6-2dc1aa8d0262|But you worked closely on this case?
c52b6365-1fa8-4be4-8a02-7f05d677d1da|She hasn't had the proper training.
d9089aac-f024-4535-9196-67ee9a977028|You just need the proper treatment.
6c658e31-968d-4abb-a627-dee563a1403e|We should bury him proper.
683d6f82-cb24-44e7-9f1a-277222450764|So, she did it really proper.
53b53897-6bf5-468c-89ac-726f84f14ce7|Don't take that tone with me, Paul.
d11d8ee0-672a-436b-bbef-d341b2b83e95|You're getting me off topic.
11a86b03-7793-4396-ba95-f377dbcbd30c|Leo and Sam doing sex no longer a topic.
fc32ad7d-809e-4580-9e0a-d44a392a9ba3|You know the topic and don't tell your friends?
85e2ac64-c832-4c73-934e-daabaa45faf5|Here, push it towards me.
ac1829dd-0019-4d76-8664-93f6c989784a|Then we start walking towards each other.
770445ea-5bc3-4fa8-ac85-060a1332e992|That was a waste of time, wasn't it?
8182230c-f7cb-4cc5-81be-2b86a6d4150f|I told you it was a waste of time.
1561a854-f27c-497b-9240-ef4bee53ed8b|It'll only be a big waste of time.
8573cdb6-e9f1-4b35-9e11-44d1a8eca605|Don't you think it's a waste of time?
ca6c1b19-7bca-42e5-bb5e-eaaa444ba211|Anything on two wheels, I can fix.
2e734249-6778-42cd-9155-72d188057fd0|Wouldn't she be, like, the third wheel?
792e3962-8377-4f7f-98fa-d2695b16a3b2|The greatest athlete that this country's ever produced.
57db023e-d0c4-494c-a000-aab88c0bb273|You just do not look like an athlete.
dac12bfd-35d2-46b2-a10c-5b9ac7e679ad|It's really more for serious athletes.
e4b6c107-4fd2-49e2-9b2a-56ad87d6fa65|Talking to athletes is what he does all day.
dfe70591-d2c0-4f4e-8cf9-2c8eda119201|Did he convince you to do this?
54b8bc7c-a929-4a9c-92a9-a64b8bc7ea5c|I'll go, I'll convince him, and I'll come back.
a4af0ab7-2a0f-407e-bc7c-d2d3bcac23b1|I tried so to convince himself.
99f492e6-a497-4d35-8be1-5b66772bfdbe|And we're still convinced they're growing the stuff?
397b2c18-6885-48eb-ab9b-0190bbd5707a|Well, you should see what she does with pepper.
c42ba2f3-c2d1-407b-a34a-82d233bea54c|How is that a pepper talk?
77121410-3bdc-4a2e-b47d-43311ca09b86|I really do love them peppers.
e000f6be-5ed9-465f-a9c0-879a984a6535|So, pepper, what happened tonight?
e59c0af2-9a92-4548-956c-31324b856f0e|Then let me feed you ice cream.
f4fffbfb-ba9e-4fc7-8c68-5d8cc417e8b8|You use too much hand cream.
d14b72d6-8d99-4888-8692-60b664ceb303|Who was it landed here before, then?
61b8baac-74ff-40c7-8d48-e0948a8cfa58|Tell me we're not landing down there.
9ab7bd15-0182-44d3-9fad-c6bac5ee88bb|Tell me where she lands.
7d4988f4-0d09-4d33-be90-60eec1dc24b0|He's very technical is Alan.
91e3cbeb-614e-45be-a70c-9563fd336ce9|Like it's a technical fault, completely innocent.
169db088-4f8d-43ea-8c72-16a4429ae58e|There were technical problems, too.
433c7f96-7f4c-4cbd-ac0e-953e56d64913|Why are you such a square?
9e3d2331-01e9-4cb6-9265-63ba39108aa5|So now we're back at square one.
35bbcc61-c5d6-4557-a583-6d3f48ef5963|Ralph won the part fair and square.
8610078d-3fd9-4be4-8e65-e2d553407bcc|Always to the front or too far behind.
a4206028-d1fb-4c49-9fc2-d8bf5e439c7b|If we don't change, we fall behind.
7be2fb06-80dd-4b7a-84fe-c77106897389|You asked for one ship to remain behind.
655d730a-2f9f-46d3-ab14-fd9fa160ae1b|Okay, she left all this behind.
879f7337-386a-4745-92e6-e6b79edfc602|Because I'm right behind you!
15a3c917-b204-41d1-83fc-8912f033efba|What did I invest in?
99e748d0-58ec-4844-a23b-89a4c62a8142|I've got over four years invested in this project.
58557831-22a6-49fd-a510-a27a1e5c3990|No, my wife and I invest in property together.
dc9a2d71-6a71-4314-97fd-956299659903|You mind if I take the other car?
18c3f573-d24e-43bb-a508-d573d1595261|I don't mind staying in.
1c078684-5061-434c-8789-cfb435256634|Would you mind taking over?
d7b0eb51-e143-4ca0-a7d3-e234cafdacaf|If you don't mind, just stay out of it.
df28de45-07d5-4346-9245-f4c016d81b22|Well, I've got a question, if you don't mind.
2c6df92a-31fa-4291-971f-c0b750711fd8|They don't see your potential.
b51bac50-085e-4826-b6ab-085ea0106416|Love the house, so much potential.
06fb9a08-6aad-4d18-95be-24aedb5fd8c3|And you'll think about what I said regarding Sally?
9daa6f18-e37e-4ff4-bfe3-48c8e3aed274|Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.
5eb0c6b7-434b-443b-97e1-623b02417e80|He knew nothing about a secret location regarding Earth.
71365571-df84-4d17-b1e9-5f207f2cdbee|Well, surely you must have been doing something illegal.
d777c7c7-eea3-479f-97b6-74a818c4e0c2|That's my kid, and that should be illegal.
8437b28c-976b-4f3b-a223-ad8f4a5e2b2b|All right, so what we're doing, is it illegal?
8c6603c5-8b8f-4d6a-8ede-0e6528b3af7b|I lowered myself to his level.
679798f1-5095-46ba-96a1-edbe0f094e7d|Their standards have been lowered over the years.
cc856a31-743f-485c-9639-0f5aa0518ffb|They're gonna have to be lowered.
324900b1-0d0d-495c-8556-cc244a3afa08|Not if you're starting a competing paper company, Michael.
86fea25f-c8a7-4cd1-b304-071a3f58d508|Look, can I compete with all of that?
ad806e97-6ee8-4789-9670-a87e1ab9ef00|I was just trying to compete with you again.
7116b512-eeb7-4273-b19e-67da992ad1a1|Another talent I never knew I had.
37793ec3-0c99-4aa3-996d-8292aa440888|A man of your talent, get it?
aacfe245-2bb1-464c-8fec-a3bbc9ec38b7|I knew she had talent.
5012df56-8cbd-4b69-8298-ee5700ea1643|It doesn't take long to spot talent.
0fd02e0a-cc43-4c65-94e7-4e6cfe09f4be|What, you think I don't have talent?
f392f53e-2752-4338-ab26-270e5444ca7c|Seeing him is not gonna make her look guilty.
e3a66018-0de4-4a2e-b69d-f7a83bef9ff1|You make me feel guilty.
1c464e38-a93c-45dd-91ac-8ec5a95d6bc3|I don't want you to feel guilty about anything.
1ed27cf1-2199-4e02-9608-cafef0170cb2|I feel so guilty just sitting here.
f828d1a3-ead0-43df-a664-9dbbba8e9afc|Well, a girl's got to make a Living.
d5bab80f-1084-4d06-9145-10fce30ecfad|I'm going to sleep in the Living room.
8c9ccb0f-5d3c-47bf-91dd-15d7d9a77bc3|Do you want to drink some milk?
f154b9a7-25f7-45ed-a680-297fbbb9249e|He says the secret's hot milk.
c8af1587-9b48-4751-b35e-dd48aed653d5|Milk, two months out of date.
1efda33f-b07e-4e54-860f-146eed430d05|I don't want your milk anymore.
24b66952-7f7c-42f4-8d45-0f67c26bbf70|I'm not much good with heights.
a264c5e0-6672-40a7-9e13-7a7733e601bc|I'll remind you that we're basically the same height.
453f695a-6e14-4015-9aaf-0a05d7718eeb|Let's get you up to your college height.
1035074f-8b99-478d-a932-aa0d3b1f51f2|He hasn't quite reached the heights that you have.
20f4843c-24e0-4fb7-9eae-d6855d3a31c9|He's serving several life sentences at iron heights.
15894de5-6ca8-4e15-b873-fca31f190951|They should be listed here.
ac7f82fc-2338-4eed-9786-f3c15d342efd|You're listed as his mother.
6d93bdd9-8a29-4da2-a3f4-9f397f2d3f37|Listing the worst things that could kill a child?
988d102c-3405-4e13-a0fd-e1a58bbafffb|And why were they listed among the dead?
bd783151-247e-445d-a6f1-39836d81315c|We're the only network with live coverage.
d9e1105c-465d-4813-8a60-ebf690a3919b|Connor asked to go live with his mom.
591dc199-d14b-468f-861d-d3948c4dd5dd|And we have some friends that live here.
a261a712-f078-49ad-8360-2ebcebac23df|You put a live round in that gun?
478aedf8-8d16-4479-9511-02a30e2daef5|Live each day like it could be your last.
f6cce3f3-c14e-4e12-888d-9186fd36e660|I have given no such assistance!
bed289f9-78e8-4167-8742-8573bf56864f|Call on my assistance any time.
7fc0390c-3124-4eb8-ae03-120fdf16e0bf|Sir, thank you so much for your assistance.
87e193bf-3ef6-453a-84a5-c8eb020a0651|I wanted to join the israeli army.
61c834c1-e023-438b-9817-cbc4b10544f5|Now they headed straight for the Israeli men's quarters.
f3eac3a9-6ecc-4f8c-a980-18d4331a89b1|Our own Israeli match factory!
9ad5cbd6-ae2d-43e0-a2e5-cc71beadd6e5|Except one's an Israeli and the other's an Arab.
c1d44020-2f08-4734-8116-178a175d94ec|She doesn't know he's gay?
83d02183-c386-435f-9939-ce907887b95f|Get some manners, gay boy!
e86472ec-36ea-4205-b726-c309cdfbe048|Of course, but this guy is gay.
7faa8488-37cf-414a-a25f-e6d9c9792976|Because for one thing, she is not gay.
3fbd5372-b274-475d-9d47-04d631d5a22d|I don't know if Bruce is gay.
d631d3ac-2fd1-453a-a2d0-9a740677dc1d|I guess you stuck with me forever.
3eb1446d-7e0c-441b-b564-d3df37a7bf66|He thought it was gonna be forever.
9217ab5c-6d86-445f-b3d1-a96a2e3bf8f2|You've been talking about breaking up with Emily forever.
5c6b55de-3663-4649-9bbe-b8f3702cde57|Seems like it's been forever.
f34e7467-3e7e-4898-bae9-ed018278a66e|Do you think they might be assessing anything else?
fe973b52-8670-4cc2-bdd6-78a1c1376846|I'd like you to assess the proof.
464adf3a-dd79-46c9-a85c-dee70c1f5dbf|Not without spending a lot more time assessing her.
f7a40e94-df0c-4713-9769-60efd9ff9315|Because I can assess someone I haven't met.
f255fd0a-8679-4cba-a15e-253da1a96228|All my life I've been weak.
bbf89cbf-0da3-4cb0-9293-07f6063e0d76|I already know his weak point.
d4272053-cdde-4777-8798-bdeb9e897c5e|Oh, watch out for you, is very weak.
8f922ba9-a732-43fc-aac7-b8c075c998f7|But, he's a weak person, but I don't care.
b43622bd-013d-4991-a154-01d56f4ee07d|You are weak and you need to be strong.
fc0f7535-82b8-434a-9a18-d5ac583863aa|You run along and meet your female.
6c911b4a-07d4-4667-823f-680563741d0e|That black one must be the female.
ac3f19f3-fa71-4fab-96de-d1579774c57b|Margaret has no female to help her.
81fa4246-bca6-4bb5-9276-cc8a26568f41|Look at this young female.
eb4cd891-d910-4798-9a3b-7c81ebb61e0c|A female with young makes an easier target.
6378b6e7-5d75-44ad-bd11-49bf3a688567|But I can provide you with cigarettes.
b28d512c-8838-4ebf-aef1-4a938b982778|I'll let you finish, but got a cigarette?
babc406f-448f-4f73-b4a0-15f9a193b828|But give me a cigarette; I'll cover it up.
62f08acc-c9a3-42d5-ae8a-c0594ee34081|You want some cigarettes, too?
5d9d5771-bfcd-4706-b4cf-a81ad2b1d873|The deputy governor will permit it?
062f7b14-1c28-4d07-82ed-a48a1e9b5a4e|We should not permit her to survive.
8945a48b-dfa4-44e0-9716-bff4080e606c|That's all I'm permitted to say on the matter.
55c45cd8-7dea-48b3-bfff-065a00104a58|Smoking's not permitted in or around the hospital.
6dbfc3cb-54f4-4b7e-8415-ada7019f2075|I have sent twenty out to seek for you.
d186546e-ad2c-4b16-893f-6ce49ac75f67|You know why I may give you twenty?
e1339571-29ae-45f0-9f1a-aea498bc398f|Twenty years of my life on this case.
7a21175d-3d4e-4d8e-b951-4b6b7bdd6d31|Have you had more than twenty?
93af0a6e-01bb-4587-9caa-ec55e59a96e9|It's quite an honor to meet you.
b6dd35a0-20b0-4b63-bc5e-d6c4c4dc628e|I want the honor of finishing him off.
57e8a04f-e4f3-46d5-9921-ae7a65d4df86|It's been an honor working for you.
3de605b4-3ceb-4a5b-9138-3cc5cfb480cd|And the honor of a lady I once loved.
71036502-3c05-4128-96d5-2b93c1d5cc82|I thought you'd be more creative than this.
a2002d05-9651-4a5d-bd47-caf042bcfe2c|And now it's the acts who have creative control.
d7b053b6-5639-41ff-bc9b-7935bafa33de|Now, get creative with this.
f1a7fb62-51be-4f21-9877-a2d1c30c972b|In my creative writing class.
af366a81-07cc-44b8-9e97-9eca803d4234|I came to make you an offer.
7bb28480-4ff3-4ef6-bab3-36890acd80e9|It could have been a very different offer.
9eb9af73-3d38-4841-9a1d-614b6da2c4d8|And I'm telling you, this is a real offer.
798a5217-693c-40a4-b32b-8696c179fb63|I mean, if the offer still stands.
565f7dcc-c945-4044-b6c4-755e85c6f8ff|Anyway, you can't knock a man's faith, Michael.
0c313522-2751-4fd0-a518-e41e5d4bc138|She knocks and he opens the door.
da9ff861-ec4a-43c4-b9a7-39af0bb7c102|I've never knocked anyone dead.
02b6ab0a-ff17-40b0-8c44-8a21ed8862d2|You're in a group and you knock on doors.
51625809-1ea5-431d-a8fd-1021790b786b|Only the latest victim was displayed like that.
a2c14581-f07b-4a21-bfb8-4ce6c19d16e0|This campus is gonna be going off all night.
af1a42c7-9fc0-4ee5-8b6f-479acf3bccab|I'll see you around campus.
245d9ec5-fb5b-4df1-a14e-666f246a7466|How do you like campus?
9d777430-f47a-45af-bba1-26b34f14ad50|You weren't on campus all day.

25f7ad34-8eee-4ee5-9c8c-ddf5f9cd6275|We're familiar with the legal definition of a gang.
a147b617-6d02-461b-b421-c93e0325dcb2|So, what's with the gray hair, old friend?
0931c69f-ee4b-4409-afb7-6b41ce4dd289|Her mom never went gray.
a5288fb0-fb42-4c97-93e3-00ee6b427fbd|I'll give you a signal to pull us up.
824abbeb-8de4-4cd3-93b0-77b21bd6b79d|We've got a signal coming through.
b56979d2-1145-4eae-8158-1e787d1fd35c|We'll have to work out a signal for that.
8b172b77-6fea-4a01-9740-655e67aec893|It puts out a huge signal.
a04619b8-a5f4-4838-a339-301c0c4e1038|Fire a warning shot at it!
1e416276-590e-4f2f-9801-4bcc52d62637|There will be no time for a public warning.
e2cbc478-b9ee-4296-b6d7-080e2749cdbf|Well, that's why I'm giving you fair warning.
49e3b423-29cf-45fe-ad1d-a0b68f9b1bf1|That's why you're getting the warning.
1171455d-2e4c-4555-b000-22385ac62080|What need would they of warning?
a05270a7-5bf5-4a8b-b70a-66b2f1d10c2c|You know, I used to be a physician.
3e4b63f4-3d78-48b0-a652-86916c6c063f|Back in the day, physicians made house calls.
99e782c6-5947-4c19-a8c0-c6ec96af703f|Doctors are much more than just physicians.
9d469456-7fa3-42a8-bede-b6d2bfd2d402|I'll tell you what column I'd write.
bb15ac46-9455-427a-815e-d95e6974b87f|That letter that you sent my column.
dbc4a76c-d4be-4d4e-9730-eb8f5fb828f9|But this middle column, I don't know.
95228fbf-ace7-4fa4-9d51-edd432c6edad|The heart of the machine is under the column.
9fae8ceb-a906-44a4-b7f0-421e367dc702|I have some ideas for her column.
e8aa15d8-75f7-43e7-b958-f1c837b4d976|Oh, I could be a lot more dramatic.
c85d7b7b-24f7-49c3-adb9-6b3528d14b02|Don't make it more dramatic.
c2ff9ed3-627d-4483-9e72-d1778793d68c|I'm sorry, that it would be so dramatic.
b3fd0a03-eeb5-4d8a-a46c-6249db527fc0|I want this to be exciting and dramatic.
651202d8-fe92-4a16-91d3-1f379a90907b|I think you're just dramatic.
b21f689b-c483-43ab-837f-eab7d2f44cd2|Where are we with reviewing the guards?
3af38c49-f100-4169-a38f-4414fd79ffd7|I'll review this and have Linda get in touch.
3dd24981-6889-4bb4-b0f4-5604feb67c53|We care about everything that affects the republic.
e3a58c08-37cc-491a-b248-10603f0fc08b|You arrest the leader of a small African republic?
98865bd8-ba40-40cf-948e-6b1bb773d74f|We share the wealth in this republic.
3fc510c3-4c9a-46d4-be95-27438a96ef42|My priority was to keep you from talking.
8839a929-0246-4305-ba37-86d72c6a701a|It has to be the priority, but it's not.
fa032fbe-db29-45de-a47b-1100428feae8|His house is not gonna be low priority.
04610767-1688-4205-a4f4-bc6c529123e5|I need you to make him a priority, Jack.
82814721-bf83-4d36-8bef-e43b1a638221|Gives her a great sense of achievement.
dc9eaeac-0ee5-44dc-ab0c-24ce88a1b342|Take a minute to consider your achievement.
f43c94f8-0aaa-440d-aee5-153230c6ff83|Can we call that an achievement?
f6aaf8f9-672e-406f-bb3f-a9a4863d7686|This all stopped being fun months ago.
6d5798ec-a428-42ca-9140-5bac5a750112|It's so fun to see him.
c9abf42e-5ddb-48cb-ab23-64de866246fb|No, but it was so fun to watch.
0cf98a4f-10d4-4b74-b950-535a7b0a818e|'Cause I've had a really fun night so far.
a779c455-3f1f-4e2c-aea3-2b9041daff1e|We've come to you with a request.
6e696fa9-467c-47e3-ad43-97ea3c6269af|Well, I sent her a request.
36fdcdc9-38c5-419c-9182-343db2163d4d|There's been a request from the phone company.
6c50c9dd-eec2-4779-81f4-1949cd1860ca|And I have a strong request for you.
68533e21-89d8-450e-9aa7-9f0e651d112e|Yeah, I got another hour to wrap this up.
9ccc7da5-b376-4166-94de-46a937fdef90|Now, I wrapped this myself.
121183ab-3496-4a96-9e2e-1eb8a22eac3d|I missed it before because it was wrapped.
749e2fb9-2594-4b28-b278-b18f7812e5f2|They didn't have any wrapping paper.
c4dbad43-eebb-4f09-bf41-77313f8d43d0|I want you to be the head engineer.
5f9f6980-7155-4573-809b-5ad4520520a3|And my engineers promise it guarantees me a win.
375abaeb-0e81-438b-b24a-4cf7ecba624b|Drink rice wine and eat good food.
a31e4fb8-f7bd-499a-abbb-a15f2e4ecab3|I care how you and agent rice do it.
006dc1ce-b440-403f-88b3-0444d7f28866|So much for your rice idea.
d601be75-2e67-4d89-8b84-ba85fd26be79|Now you are a scholar, so am I.
6d912f26-97e6-4504-8a1a-046df23d48ad|Now, scholars are divided into three schools of thought.
37d17d4f-e36f-43ad-a037-ec703cbb800f|As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
2479f583-302b-4598-aa4d-c60c856ad568|Not sure if you can afford such an expense!
e9a33cf1-bc3f-46b7-a946-33fdab5cb861|He's not even covering my expenses.
a99e4481-3b3b-488f-97f0-62114878bfa5|I checked his personal accounts, his business expenses.
7a497146-2af3-4d17-a3fb-2d075e925c01|But notice this hole, this gap right here.
b03c8e35-a17d-4143-a468-c46bd5d1712d|I shall close the gap, from this point forward.
47db27e5-5988-4537-8992-3daf08953ade|Or have your gap years come to an end?
3bac328b-e5ca-42ea-a59a-f80d70593adb|I did manage to land in a gap.
08a022ae-19de-4077-8998-4813a3c802ef|Let's just say I fill gaps in important collections.
594f6674-8d8f-4f99-990b-9f0f1692199f|Because they've been hiding their true agenda.
10cf449f-afcb-4a21-975e-a6d59f06cade|What else is on the agenda for today?
1d4b24fd-e080-4ecb-8bae-1d2dadc3ee6c|Let us follow the agenda order.
f943aa3e-9cf0-430b-8cda-1fe1975e6252|We'll move onto the new business on the agenda.
90af2b2c-fb0e-4a36-a84e-6a919b5f55f7|And at the back, there was Jeremy's creation.
9b14ee5c-e6dd-4b24-9ebf-5227e267e7f8|All of them seems to like your creations.
81fb8065-41fb-4c8a-9d7a-6908204ca079|You were gonna be my next creation.
b47a6b39-2274-415a-bb62-d5f1f5c783eb|We drag it along like a big old dog.
7c73010e-3dfe-4191-923f-46ee866a55c5|You won't drag me down to your level.
261f8447-686e-4663-a420-03c84a9481d8|You're the one who dragged me back into this.
8c1d8730-d56c-4fc5-88ce-43d028a61524|And now we're murder suspects.
b3069ada-0b16-4aa3-afaa-a751d711fe30|Okay, they picked up our suspect and his vehicle.
680bd3b3-22bb-423a-b823-59d51d1e107f|It seems I'm always suspect.
31b10eb8-491f-4f0a-b732-ed4cf972c8b7|Jane has suspected us for so long.
c46a3c23-5881-4f8e-9f60-30b9b00ad138|He goes fishing on the weekends.
ec4ece9f-5e30-43bf-8f57-a2e9d22db921|We grew up together, went fishing every weekend.
2e25b9d0-adbd-408e-baf4-5d03180f6548|No, he's still fishing out body parts.
16b437fe-bb15-4f20-a613-104b24e97f0a|We went fishing one time.
09c71c50-79c8-488d-a22a-2defcf110394|Remember your dad took you fishing one time?
8f3b420c-88fa-43ea-9603-cac4098d1d23|What if one doesn't care for bread?
35b9fff7-66e7-4de1-abb6-f812a1f5e589|We have problems with bread.
cbeff472-7e1b-4541-8dc8-6afaf9591772|What, and miss out on half the bread?
b59a7fce-5fb9-4ebb-8d0f-3cd652e95f17|I'm for games, you're for bread.
dad236b6-c33a-44f2-b8ca-07bf28938025|Or dealing with it, unable to.
b9d8c326-54c0-42ec-8d4e-ee7ac2ce497d|Then I will be unable to help you.
bbfd13f5-ddaa-47b7-b064-9a6352230507|Why am I unable to move?
5571b884-2e21-4029-8e2a-498667eefdc4|And no one heard screaming?
0c9e8f57-2a0a-4c19-a6a1-d4b48f4fa76e|She was like screaming and crying last night.
55e1deb3-2fcf-465d-977f-1fb801b9ce05|Don't scream, it's no big deal!
0c135f3e-9dd6-462c-9a62-1a53eed03b8f|Who is luckier than me?
1584ba0d-9bd5-461a-a34c-d0098ebf29e8|He was very lucky you were here.
78bea6c5-5b2c-4ebc-a6a8-9375bb37196a|It made me feel lucky to have him.
301f53ab-0b41-4f8b-9e4d-c4b80edc6f98|I sure am lucky today.
b78a1ec9-f562-4610-969a-c46570883e3c|Barney Miller is in excellent health.
3ac0fb09-730a-4f9d-85d1-f1a5564d778c|You have to admit, I have an excellent voice.
582b3fb8-1bc6-4c33-97b7-ff45d15b4052|Well, that is an excellent choice.
7bb768fa-4067-4a0a-80e4-4a1187322274|That's an excellent idea, my friend.
b1927088-68ed-4863-91cf-cd905323ffed|But what is mass and why does it exist?
b878448b-e763-4339-9619-960fda002c1c|What we are dealing with is a mass mind.
c6811fee-82c7-49e6-be68-2b908587bf37|Make a mass search of the top floor.
4f1ae339-52c0-4cf3-8a5c-b98937b9a48c|Payment for those books was made weeks ago.
adb83ebe-debd-47a6-806d-acffa4ee3e00|I'll call and set up payments.
f0c72544-94b3-44a9-b6b0-9fe042e1942d|And I deserve my payment in full.
acf61fae-9cbb-4f2a-a178-68c88f361b2a|Your payment will come in due course.
3c575502-f1b2-4a01-a7ef-38583932da51|And it went deeper with each breath.
99d9cee5-f57b-4b8f-b6f2-8de1c7fc39cc|You shouldn't go deeper in the hole.
f3d6906c-e922-46aa-be35-203ff320e8b3|Careful, these pools run deep.
77fa9fa6-1cdf-43d7-a9fa-4be38bf95b34|You can make a party out of jury selection?
b0a678e0-8bb5-433f-9756-d590aad20275|These are the five pieces of your selection.
f426245c-af96-4a10-ab74-ae27f0679050|During the selection process, you are under my command!
1b99487f-03e3-4199-aab7-6450fddabe69|I'm driving the clients to the lab right now.
9c7553f7-12b5-468e-b43c-be19163c4e18|Well, we're lab partners, right?
0f5d48ca-f0b5-48ee-98c7-7ea2abcbe54b|Listen, what happened to me in the lab?
77cb8ab3-4b04-4148-bea6-1748a64851ea|Well, get it over to the lab.
0f71af93-609d-4183-9038-9e85c51e67c3|They know we spoke the night you were arrested.
36e44644-53c5-4e8c-bdf8-c18966a67ac9|I'll have it arrested immediately.
7408f934-e9b9-45ea-bb8d-5cd075f17e47|My job is to arrest them.
61ae0e9e-d88b-4a19-9aca-d996a4845010|They will arrest you if you show up again.
3b099259-adbe-4813-b3cb-549cea8029bc|What if we get someone else to arrest him?
5d0b6eb1-23bb-427f-908e-ec59d2479224|You care for him deeply.
33e0d69e-ac83-4895-99fd-47d60185fbf9|We're deeply sorry for the trouble they've caused here.
59bba457-e0ee-40cc-a82b-46132e6ef1b3|He has fallen deeply in love.
ee1e3ce7-89a4-471b-bf28-6c3fe96ce371|We need to dig more deeply into Nathan's life.
08843386-01ec-478c-b8de-f754c8c2504f|There's something that's just deeply powerful about you.
2fad3f9b-6b0c-429b-a974-e87ab8d55a87|It makes me sad to see you like this.
bc00018b-0b4e-4463-850b-21f35b9e758d|My good friend, today is a sad day.
b1df2554-cd7a-4b12-8a45-82e995f455b2|That may be the saddest thing I've ever heard.
0c58236e-99f5-4669-9db5-a54dd92e589e|Go be sad on your boat.
c38af3e4-af88-4c1f-b701-37655a4b2e40|No one can imagine my childhood.
ac08492b-7726-4a05-b7cd-55236c1371a6|I wanted to show my daughter her childhood home.
3af77057-4424-4048-b634-5684f5a2d162|Then we would have Max's childhood.
6e6e75d0-de1d-44ed-a903-aedb45fa64cf|My childhood was by my side.
989a0312-94d3-4b16-8f54-4651e63f0a95|Suppose you checked into mine.
02a1c8d0-7dbe-4f7a-820e-2fa06bad26fe|I suppose you're young, but you're still very small.
b2628d46-1056-4d1c-9a68-481f766ca3e4|I suppose we both do.
d3174058-c849-418b-a3bf-a518eaf23993|Yeah, I suppose that's a word for it.
c21f1746-745f-4894-87b3-a74f10c95d73|I was fairly high when it was happening.
24f9e627-d894-405e-a4a8-1cfd5fc88635|It's up on a hill and fairly open.
19024f35-9bc5-45c5-b168-3b8ad04bbc56|I'm fairly certain you're going to like it.
597ab2a5-dec1-454e-81b3-524957d51429|I'm fairly certain that isn't you.
a3c45b95-2b01-4e4f-9854-1c908ae07326|I didn't hear you, which is fairly unusual.
3a65679d-4639-40cd-a6fd-d4073c794a0b|But the way you responded was violent.
8de47ae0-55f6-4ad1-8b68-7db4cae66964|Why is everybody in this city so violent?
99d94a60-294e-4de0-a0db-3ed7f84f7851|It's so violent and dark.
66f54dcb-b8c6-42c7-bba8-915edebb425f|None are violent, although by now I would be.
2e18211d-9511-423c-a8d9-5b006e713d00|My acting has to be violent.
13505a3e-c748-4017-8dc2-74e0fb638a23|And he's really quite recovered?
489dfc8e-719d-4cbd-a331-9a80ce0d254a|I'm actually still recovering from it.
06fdfd06-419b-4e34-8e5c-003173c7064d|I was recovering a video for him.
2ee82eb8-a8f3-40e2-af20-ebce9900c37f|He's gonna kill me as soon as he's recovered.
d4a9e84f-17f6-451b-9a5f-d24f90bf8f5d|But he will recover, won't he?
1bee5ed4-e2f3-425f-86b6-40fcfd798be3|Well, if you ever need any roofing doing.
60f4602d-cab6-489c-9c43-9d09106c836d|I told you kids stole that roof.
dd534bd3-9a78-4af7-89a8-900f15d8b58c|Tying up second amendment rights in red tape.
d673af75-795c-46aa-b187-932fc16b3645|We require an amendment in the name of trust.
c74133cd-e4f9-4df9-9982-c3b82f1df6a6|Can you tell us what the fifth amendment is?
6a6d5393-2b80-472d-adb2-8bae2c696cc4|You ever heard of the first amendment?
38133b53-70e4-480e-9996-eeed49ff25fa|That's why I like the basic emotions.
c3d41ce4-d850-41bd-981e-cdf6b7b9e9fc|Just something to let my emotions settle.
5fd632b7-1c93-4278-be13-c3be1d8869b2|I wanna graduate from college before I get married.
24ab005f-733d-4d1d-a4ea-bf9f61827ed2|How are our two beautiful graduate students doing?
75093912-f196-42e9-83bf-534e6b03fffd|That factory's been abandoned for years.
e9462f4f-1409-4f45-86db-a5f47c9d2de8|His new partner at the factory.
2ce47024-5409-4480-a09a-330593b5405a|I saved everyone in that factory.
3cb9d66c-c382-484f-8b94-28e217bd9d0a|He spent his life working in a factory.
10fa8108-2244-4014-ac4b-6dfc7ae7e16e|My career plan is four years ahead of schedule.
0c4bce60-dcb6-4e2c-99ab-6429d0ce66f9|I know you have a packed schedule.
47483c32-259d-4d43-9f6d-ac8032de84bd|Let's go over your schedule for next week.
57f2170f-bca3-4f17-8186-dd30117b2ddc|Well, that smile must mean we're on schedule.
0eef9225-165f-4c11-b0cd-74ee271fee33|I was just checking the schedules.
823277f1-15d6-43be-bb47-b45bf9776abd|I don't know, it's a long avenue.
e633d1bf-27b3-45cb-8de9-2176f43a0fba|You say that like it's a bad avenue.
0a0e9c2a-a138-495f-bdf8-7949b42f817e|And I do have other avenues to explore.
304937b7-697c-49dd-b7cc-345e11b1cd0d|Usual avenues: friends, family, work colleagues.
7f5f0c3e-5826-434a-b1fa-2d8ac92d9a12|Our people have a spiritual right to this land!
a5fd9301-6f2c-4a6e-92e6-82a1fa26fec5|And from this spiritual love, he will create Paul.
8fae04c0-feae-4a74-a068-bf97e792c39c|That is how one becomes a spiritual guide.
bfe8f47c-d28b-47ca-9697-ace29ce4ec3f|Oh, think of it as a spiritual safe house.
dbc0a3d4-878a-42f0-875c-a367d524d1b4|You want to be on the rides, don't you?
53f36136-b6c0-45ed-bec1-8954ad1b63a1|Maybe I can give you a ride home.
ab875451-ebaf-474d-a576-c46d4a504f4c|Come now, let's ride together.
0a38cdb2-e082-4df5-80dc-83c54fedad3f|Now look at you, washing them yourself.
e6c10acd-3047-48be-8dad-1114be70c186|Then, you weren't going to wash before you went?
734b5d42-84da-4382-81ca-2192b2f9af8d|Let's clear the table and wash up now.
45a10dd9-fa9c-4428-8587-34fbbaa7ad13|It will wash up soon enough.
64a800ce-cd88-4c99-9883-db79ccc067ed|Where should I wash them?
8cc3d569-d307-49b6-b3c5-fd664653d24f|I'm never going back to my old self.
392abf17-38c8-4772-ba18-debcfd6ebe41|It appears he's back to his old self again.
f2d42fd7-af43-4c9c-af64-e35c4eefff2a|I can take my own self out.
b4ec5722-5221-4f9f-9520-6e9d3645efe6|There was shouting and some kind of struggle.
e97c92a5-f0d3-4676-8b83-86d741b1eafc|I mean, I almost had to shout.
02befcbf-7b66-40fd-8fc3-2ce55a7655fa|They all ran and they shouted a lot.
0b662a13-4b34-4418-a184-04df5e4c63b8|Let's not shout from across the room.
010e3b4d-8a41-4eb5-a000-610a57906548|Why do you keep silent all the time?
b9acc62b-1e89-4625-a3e8-752cb1a6605e|I notice they are all silent.
42728ae8-6036-41bf-8515-168180b8d0fc|Even for as brief a time as I did.
2b803db8-e583-4cf9-bca9-ed08a99f8fbe|Have you been briefed about how this works?
73a0ac5b-351d-4c7f-897d-930e2510f83b|George, only a brief document or two left.
f2e98577-fa10-40b3-b277-b79d2846081e|I made errors in the report.
e6d5ed7b-06fc-4ab6-81fa-0f1a1b7ba088|Can we say that it was just an error?
a48a7482-5f2e-453b-9a0e-7c085e0ae8cd|And in that case, it was doctor error.
8fa052a0-1102-48ee-97f0-f776e40c8d1f|All right, there's no room for error here.
03444cf9-0502-4c64-816c-b9c67603932d|There is no room for error.
55839fa2-8857-4a17-971b-7680eceb9baa|They vary widely in quality.
a5d360df-8b29-4d2a-bb89-bcd7dbf930ea|I like that it's getting dark earlier.
1f3365a8-78b3-4688-a465-e5d88ba68b94|I see a whole lot of dark.
03c45a9e-3265-4762-b411-49afff6f2c1f|See you home before dark.
f2a0e560-028f-4bbc-b299-cccd0a629a14|I guess I'll find something a little more immediate.
6567620e-1d36-4107-b9c1-63cffb6a9f8a|The immediate state following physical death?
2b8bd91f-bd56-4789-88cf-07aa91ff191d|I have much more immediate concerns.
13c4ffe5-b232-4155-ae01-161a07014448|Then I purchase it from you.
78e9321d-9f3c-490b-8536-4b09260d10df|They purchased a phone with cash.
370eb347-7b10-4c1f-8018-238572b99125|That property was purchased for exactly one dollar.
02bbf343-70cc-44ad-8a96-d16edfc1f44a|You just go out and purchase one for yourself.
a7cc0418-7811-4381-920f-5cf2f6868a26|Georgia's been doing a little too much leading.
6aa18fb6-6bd6-42f9-8542-d3ee5752662f|She'd just landed her first leading role.
f4fa9953-133b-4462-8abd-63f692b3d31e|What was our first leading role?
a31dec96-73e0-4f06-8472-54ed28ebb1c8|I've been funding his research for years.
05dab242-7652-4a43-bb8e-bef8903323eb|So now we're funding terrorists.
00cd290b-e385-4e80-b4d0-4e4e0d617e9f|He was funding Rachel through law school.
14cf70a3-e747-492a-9118-b316abc3d69b|What, like funding your drug habit?
455b7a69-5d27-41e3-b03c-9bcee1c439c4|I'm tired of funding other people's stupid dreams here.
83fae2d3-095a-4def-a1c6-937adc34421e|He also sent a settlement offer.
79bef40e-bf3c-4c01-b209-d58525bdaf84|You realize your marriage settlement will have to go?
6772ef87-f710-4455-abf1-d3fb049571ab|It seems our prayers may not be answered.
c04db101-83c7-4368-981e-252fdc32ac36|It's always good to pop in for a prayer.
6e8fb379-2d34-48cc-bd76-3d40a52b116b|This is your last prayer!
34dbb0db-a16b-4b95-8366-110912359aa8|I could hear your prayers.
f264d1ae-cb50-4d06-aa7c-ae30653f844d|No, all it really took was the initiative.
2a129942-d40b-4a13-9ce2-18a5967dee75|I assume she used her initiative.
6e087ee6-0859-43f9-86a1-26736a8b341b|There's nothing wrong with an agent showing some initiative.
0ef8f00a-4b6d-4e9c-a0ad-54cce74de30c|I don't like the women who take the initiative.
099c294b-bc43-4972-ae12-affdedc213fb|Then we have to go to our primary initiative.
ccfbf6e1-24c6-4bbb-a553-abd2938f114c|I can't leave before my coalition partner.
dd236d59-35c6-48ea-90ca-cfe8a396daed|You know how people build a coalition?
d825bcbe-4594-45a6-afb8-66b221743f58|All of the coalition books appear to be clean.
51ab050e-8f57-4dcb-a4f4-ee04fcf0c57d|I'd like to introduce members of our coalition.
dd4bda1a-2743-438d-8b41-af16ce7f7421|We can just take off a portion of it.
4cf884f4-28af-427c-aea2-d5d01ed74bc2|And the portions were so small.
f1841b49-328c-49e4-a0f7-98bbf1a7f71b|We're done with that portion.
b946cc12-e95d-4e3f-b4b1-aaf1a078e50b|Your opponent can be very fast.
4845d485-5839-4c23-b932-b2a710c05a01|Well, we lost to all our opponents.
16f32381-1ab2-4078-9556-28463e57d92e|If you are nervous, you give your opponent signs.
93e4d644-32da-47e0-b0b6-75e190f68752|Keep eye upon your opponent.
ad2752eb-ecfd-4053-9677-8276204543c6|But I had a different opponent in mind tonight.
dfdd740d-1f0b-4502-9267-369685de04b0|Why can you two not be together without tension?
47f4dc6e-7404-4345-a370-b223b70a792d|There will be no tension.
cd0dbcad-31ac-44bc-ad71-85f6c27d9d60|No no, there's no tension, Charlie.
de4ab291-471e-485e-b5c7-ad8ccee63bce|Read chapters nine through ten for next week.
5156e3cf-aedb-4107-8ac9-2df0c712e991|That's in chapter three of my book.
1c87ab40-9263-432e-8078-a3417762c6cc|The next chapter is not that long.
978ef98d-5bdf-46dc-bf4c-bf341b0440ca|You didn't even bother trying to find him.
2fc9e39f-0b06-4092-bc22-1a94b25dff57|Have you not bothered me enough?
e46cb084-818f-4039-ab53-d39b2bd7ec93|Oh, that don't bother me none.
2d83e126-ccd1-4060-8d3e-0af550ed6bb5|What right do you have to bother me?
84836c2e-6dd4-47e6-8965-00e861c70543|And what exactly does this business consist of?
e8eb7924-50b1-499f-904e-d8f6654ff84c|We know what a face consists of.
507b470c-3bd5-49ee-b5a1-3c440fa09181|And you target immigrants, too?
6220391d-8871-40ff-b2c7-564dddf883a9|I was once an illegal immigrant too.
57d2824f-55cf-4bca-adf0-a582454e9fa0|He could have been killed because he's an immigrant.
33f01015-9896-47bd-b47b-8ccc82356a3b|And this one part really does enable this product.
35d6455e-a0f4-4c30-95f6-69fa4ac114c9|And we're staying at the faculty housing.
78dc12e1-c4e7-495a-9b79-7f6b4eb54a1c|The hospital is next to your faculty.
00b0084e-fc94-43d7-b44b-3c05e23eeb30|I'll call you from the faculty.
6967e6f1-0cb7-4bd9-b81e-e6540d01cbf7|We cannot go to war with a faculty member.
a450385a-4b12-4e17-b47e-64eb20a787ad|I mean, these things cut through steel, rock, wood.
d5ac0797-0f8b-4f45-8a20-617c85d26236|How do you know I'm not a steel?
b91ff980-ae89-4390-9b44-4daffd771587|You have a front door made of steel.
439cbaef-40c6-4830-8730-ad1319f50f4e|Yeah, you put those together, that makes steel.
4490bc78-66d8-41d4-875b-979d6e34502b|There's too much steel in their roof.
575bb330-d883-4cd2-a499-17e7ad23aa26|I'm as dry as the desert.
8ac6b971-f988-48fd-9762-a393120367c6|They get lost in the desert.
7fca466e-43c2-4128-8c1b-2d565d31b8b8|But that is the desert, I believe.
96346c89-ec6b-4ccf-8f65-4b1f7fae7467|You just lost us a valuable asset.
fb588827-57dc-4100-8b8b-1199b3574dba|No red assets have ever been lost.
95178839-5a6d-44c2-9d67-78ab5391ee59|Something to add to our pool of assets.
cdb1451f-60c8-4fee-8198-324971bac37d|I want the asset in theater by morning.
c4987d57-42b6-41fc-ae79-8d76c1a4368a|You've been a great asset to this company.
adcfa9dc-3ac9-4ea0-925f-5bf6df7d5839|I should probably tell you to slow down.
91716ea8-7faf-4f89-8358-bcb058825d2c|You'd just slow me down anyway.
b90a3964-3e8b-4434-82e4-34372116c948|Can you slow down a bit?
b3131015-a46c-47e5-8ad6-13f639413cc3|You guys have got to slow down.
6cf28477-b7c8-4109-abe6-b5f131fadbb4|You transform life into something new.
248fffec-4be2-4462-917d-89f28975b2dd|I have no idea what makes them transform.
bc323a97-8540-4007-9bb3-a8134e0ca2ef|It may be perceived as a bit negative.
e32cbb34-dbeb-4ed2-91e2-cf9e341f7c3f|At least that's the way he perceives it.
b2c8b1c9-42e4-40d6-9ff5-3ee5d8f20bda|The human brain believes what it perceives.
b6385227-1aab-4334-92d9-1b88eaf62f5b|Next week you'll be treating me for depression!
8278ccd9-3244-42f3-8d14-254d73efb370|It certainly can't buy you out of depression.
5b6360b7-27db-4796-8739-98a8669be8c5|Was she being treated for her depression?
89b8ccea-61f6-4dc7-bf2f-b1a66cd9a2cc|Did you know that I suffer from depression?
a05ee047-a137-4281-835a-ff2032f70d3c|The people you selected are suffering from depression?
af50f98c-0aec-49c0-810f-c5510f021532|I'll do my best to keep you informed.
ac25168a-e16d-421a-9817-d88badbc8bd6|We must be informed at once.
2d405b5c-ade9-4954-887e-fd8804136c94|The kind where I inform on someone.
017e4e74-946a-4a26-8e56-88d6b7f8c2bd|I'm sorry I didn't inform you sooner.
be31c2ef-6d6b-4717-931e-221004d198e1|Why don't you make a formal complaint?
6e8cd1dc-72f5-4566-bb93-1629f415143c|And stop being so formal with me.
88f8bf57-3ce0-40dd-8c44-72fefdb35857|Are you always like this, so formal?
77e59968-b442-402a-b438-cd71e6eb8977|Yeah, who abandoned you back on Sarah's planet.
32a4ced3-7d1b-4d3c-8691-cd6b8d0a40e1|They abandon hope and burn the city.
bc8ecf54-0622-4898-a11d-0e174676a3b7|If she was abandoned, that would explain all this.
6e07f406-579e-4d8a-a0b3-71952f3ab837|I can't believe I abandoned her.
1a42f5a0-fde0-4fd3-96dd-d3a045b152af|She abandoned the two of you, I didn't.
8b021a32-41c0-4817-b555-1e25bbbe98c4|We don't have them in the release areas.
af46dff7-8151-4437-908f-375e6975d2db|I wonder what he meant by release me.
2516cba6-b520-4ef3-b786-26be1c858ba0|They wanted their chip back.
a12c0407-b788-4de0-adf7-b2982955c9db|She's a chip off the old block.
1bbb53fe-bfc5-40c5-bb4c-6ff1c0fd17fb|All money is to be in those chips.
e1058ae3-9f72-42bd-a4a2-cc60ba11cf3f|Do you know what Chip told me about you?
096745bf-1a25-457e-b904-bf25eda8b3af|You told me it was on a double date.
3b8d7856-b08f-4d64-a030-7f04801c07e6|Can you help me bring up the double bed?
064d2174-6be2-4637-a1ff-b93af0835e44|He's decided to reveal where the remaining bodies are.
5260e00a-bc7c-49cc-8294-2863b9f751fa|As you know, I possess all the remaining water.
73037cfe-1133-4d32-be80-afb9f7c6f795|They should be wiped from existence.
89cc477a-60b8-4c9a-9865-9698028dc437|He kept your existence a secret.
d77e7154-3e5d-47f7-9c80-a193b7346e4b|The one who spoke us into existence.
2fe18f6a-1bf0-477a-8c8d-752e4c9ac01b|You think maybe it was the extra cheese?
4077e176-672d-46f6-983e-2528a81cb085|I don't want any cheese ball, alright.
7ca9a016-a710-4dff-83a6-b5f28638390f|English cheese is so blue, it's angry.
57e52583-3b2c-419a-8710-f163516b8646|You know they're only designed to go through cheese.
64d06e12-f80b-4eb2-a04c-981c2250393d|And you could have used real cheese.
76b64913-5a45-4b1f-a5c6-4e4501f42111|They go together in making chain link fence.
02116a73-dcef-4e45-977b-bb318a8bb0f7|Yeah, I got the link you sent me.
67802ed0-b287-4809-9288-64624120372a|Still, it's the only link we got so far.
5c9bfcbb-65a9-446c-b6a7-311bf85851fd|I was in the joint with him.
1047ef66-0ee7-43ea-b7d5-8c06e5bac1ec|Perhaps through a joint creative project.
7de569d5-652d-4b71-b62c-aa944852bd7f|I assume it's a joint account?
b8515b65-5305-496c-8868-de5a467f9a55|Well, that must be the joint right there.
4ae83a30-4d3a-4bab-a4e9-f04b386d322e|Your government bonds, your savings bonds, your liberty bonds.
8ab73244-40e8-4131-a6d6-a3cd5f9c5683|Our whole life savings gone just like that.
e277ea2d-4ca2-474a-a179-d6fcf26ceb1d|I can't take your life savings.
84a6eb96-b838-4640-b9d8-56f187448400|He invested everyone's savings into this place.
41489302-9d01-4677-903e-facfda702d96|No, I want it in my savings account.
92d43966-f659-4330-8952-3431078cbfa6|Look, I can rule on this.
e0063dc6-4134-477c-bb6a-5b8a2c117491|I was no longer interested in ruling anymore.
03658863-cb3b-4a0d-bb44-b0166c2668ec|Well, apparently, you have ruled it out.
e7063001-17b2-4a5f-b314-c7bbc0c52456|We ruled out sex with other people.
52dc6f73-709a-445b-8f7e-adc5f3c850a7|That could be bad news for the ruling class.
aed1ca14-92ef-4397-8149-d95b24a1e2a3|But the only one that preserves both sides.
d3edc7c2-6e99-4280-bc61-ee80f255ece4|I think I have discovered something that preserves it.
05b321ff-af82-43c1-9398-2cc621b21cd6|As long as you're alive, preserve your life.
5a65d2df-c5a0-4ee7-9634-e36d1ff6d080|It was about preserving your memory of your father.
e6ad9632-59d9-4ceb-81d8-6a5aa2336146|That's right, I'm still on my diet.
8c77cba8-a09f-4b51-bf76-61a9dc934643|I just thought I'd go on a little diet.
459d6ada-5d73-4b56-aa28-8a0c9a340574|What was that diet you all went on?
63b38760-9625-4038-9326-837d45d3d591|Don't tell me you're on a diet.
ebfef87a-9174-47c0-a55d-0d598fff1e82|Well, that could be the best diet ever, right?
c1d41016-30f3-4105-a7d8-7226c8fe5601|What exactly is his territory?
9c0cd4d0-d5ae-48ba-b1aa-c12e75b40af0|You'll be safe there on Russian territory.
ece05a8e-f265-4763-97be-0fa9a456d4cb|You built this club on our territory.
681b6e1c-a58a-40fa-b6f7-211006cffdfd|'Cause they'll be here at tea time.
df192fbc-8194-40a4-b309-11411bdc4c83|Your totally too late for tea.
89bd8c1b-1e7b-4740-8d70-b587f16dc1a5|I don't think they drink tea.
1ce4a24b-fcae-47d1-8bb8-83930af6ebe3|Have a tea, if you like.
a93241e1-a141-4057-a670-fbcd7f46f233|Guys just want to see me bend over.
a3816e31-d499-4084-90f5-5cee6e6e3cd8|Thank you for letting us bend the rules.
03d37145-ce17-46b9-a0fd-7301bd0a2382|Just bend it ever so slightly.
63502727-5138-4853-be6e-d0dac6e7896b|They have the most to lose, or gain.
b8b4f4ee-22ad-4095-8548-48024f89fa90|I'm not in this for personal gain.
074c0a34-3b59-400d-8d7f-3a4a98a45ad6|Or is it for some personal gain?
92053db6-54c8-4516-9d9a-6df7edf53b9f|Whether your first night can be arranged right here?
7c0c6002-a894-414b-88c0-df259cf5f8b0|And it was not easy to arrange.
9458c9cc-b9df-46e2-90cd-374ac7dc0815|It's like it was all arranged.
90c51f24-964a-4e91-b1f5-dae71c9334e8|It was arranged this morning.
cd5fd251-8514-4ac0-b54d-8babff9a14b3|Today, we will test your strength and resolve.
2ce4d2bb-238a-4aee-a17d-756f274b3734|I must not lose my resolve.
d57a9a54-82ad-4d11-922a-3eee27737606|Clearly you have not resolved your feelings for him.
5425d515-39b4-43a7-9524-77f79a37ff0e|I'm resolved to have my word mean something.
06528572-f5f0-477c-b66b-15a4f7f2e6a0|Yeah, that's why I like to practice my walking.
e0157d60-1fb3-41da-b1a1-4afe1711339e|Eddie was always more talk than walk.
9e7f5411-e388-4de7-8d79-dfe4ce2b9c14|This walk is exactly what you need.
719b3382-fcb4-4ae2-b060-1b4240db3354|They'll find passage home from there.
c0269773-e70f-4926-9159-b0bb3d5fbc37|I marked a passage in it.
f673a37a-1505-4856-9f5b-ef7c5daffe5c|We want a car and safe passage guaranteed.
900d6824-ecc2-4748-a040-1de887b79ab6|We can guarantee safe passage.
12a0e90a-64a2-43f5-a4ef-4f243b6b7a5f|You've got to read this little passage here.
df229511-3e9d-4485-8040-574f68f01f84|You keep me locked in this room?
4b9378d6-589f-4749-a8b0-4edec3a0fcf4|I was locked up once, not by choice.
3d5dc5cd-db5b-49fd-80bd-eeed6b66709e|He has locked himself in his office.
db3b4b2a-a148-45ab-898c-13ca5cafefc7|You could lock your doors.
1ccb0e33-fb90-47af-957f-f4352558f4b1|And he wants to tear it up.
a325b35a-9a32-4c57-86af-1fed8f3c68e1|Didn't even tear up that time.
16512525-261f-4e49-97c0-50dff1d078de|But Harry will tear his dinner suit.
9cb9158e-b750-4361-85f2-2036c9a1e0d0|I'm going to tear his face off.
f54fb024-d1e6-4a0a-b05a-82707c3392c5|I know every Resistance cell within five miles.
10d8f627-5a1e-4912-b589-135134964e61|The Resistance could have taken them anywhere.
ee1f99be-ee54-4e2a-afba-2d071424998d|I know about the suit's natural resistance, Ray.
92c39667-f9e0-47aa-bd99-8679aaccdf16|I think I know what this resistance is about.
4355040b-c581-484e-8aa3-4f15a657a75a|I have exciting presents for all of you.
474d58df-a78d-481b-a9cd-72fd623e1dff|Maybe they'd like to open some presents first.
1b96241e-fe8d-483c-a387-bbbe8da4f0ee|And sorry about all the Christmas and birthday presents.
63f84729-d229-4ed7-bf77-8a1db60e66b9|You can't look for Monica's presents.
44f26aca-1751-4904-8468-66e70e4eaf15|The water in the stream is good.
b56dfd33-95e8-49dc-b477-fa99c1b05389|I never swam before in this stream.
4d54e209-3011-4e56-9490-0f8d190e8563|These are streams of life force.
0532f266-59cd-4ad8-8689-f5af9d52e6f1|See this little series of hills around that stream?
b24ec20d-883a-4788-af2a-1cb5388adec0|But don't just slide into it.
cf073bae-48a5-4220-bd7f-0e86ee16ead9|Just slide down just a little bit.
6480481b-1ff1-4719-86a4-46aaf30e9b54|No, I'm gonna let you slide on that one.
018a1cc1-213b-470f-a36c-708d9472eae1|I guess you used to slide your chair back.
2691cef0-c0e4-44c1-94ff-3ab11b6dcd47|Fresh green like a dream of a new world.
5db4b865-046a-49ad-ad75-5191bd3ccb3f|I don't want greens fees going up.
130fc589-4d0e-4e5c-9ff5-8508a7870278|But if your money's green then it's all good.
8c83c7c8-0096-4357-935e-e9618835641f|Have you gone a darker green?
2a7ca585-0f47-4bc7-96f2-07c8585b1f60|I have to keep my skills sharp.
133b6039-ea8f-4f3b-9e60-a6463898fe26|You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?
38c3bffa-a91a-4821-b9c0-ee36551c8919|But they are not sharp enough.
7408b448-30ca-45c7-b6d1-9217fc50100a|And my brain's as sharp as it ever was.
2be657e4-c295-4557-ae14-5cfeb268ca80|Display, display open body language.
99e0cdda-d0d6-42ab-b0da-a210e6d419c0|That's why it's not on display often.
c56fb6bb-ab17-4c26-a4da-09d1c0975887|We came up with a name for their displays.
4aca512d-1a28-4016-a0d7-37da763808e4|Displays his victims like family.
84b63772-9ea6-4130-9de4-48b56e149c72|We will leave here and display.
c44e3006-53f0-48c7-8377-8e4f3612b448|We were going to start another cycle next week.
8772eb66-fe9c-4f2a-97cd-507bc15ccee9|Which has nothing to do cycle.
3f7b52f1-df35-4eb6-8efc-3d2bee8432f9|Another cycle that might get them pregnant.
00cadda9-fad9-4402-9687-17b5528466c0|People posing as her late father.
b148c6c7-2795-49a7-ba2c-d66770691a9b|She'll pose no flight risk.
4f3ddddc-fa67-41fe-92f7-a0a352622f18|Why be afraid of posing for me?
b2a0c100-2846-4533-86da-1416af22f307|I just sort of hoped it was a phase.
b2817b25-136f-4521-b4b2-794af406fa3a|Then we are in phase three.
851d1d10-61ba-40f7-9633-f01f66d52f9b|Chris is just going through a phase.
b6794a79-779f-43df-86b4-e16f6a6970bc|I'm not sure you're handling the transition.
1b3588b2-6159-44a0-9349-5cb199d84a9b|Yeah, right before my transition.
64710dde-aa92-434c-a274-bcc9a54515a1|I'm not sure she was ready for the transition.
336c0033-3941-4432-80e0-867d61da425d|So, how can I help you with the transition?
222ae39e-2043-4df4-96f7-655e4c5f99d3|Do you ever do breast reductions on men?
76b9d1e1-3e87-4b4c-8569-bb102903854c|I had to interview some people outside for you.
c55aa974-a4a8-4692-ad5d-db89e08e7400|I'd really like to interview them.
7927c48b-67ad-43df-8020-d5709181f0aa|I heard he was interviewing lawyers over the summer.
473d50bf-99ac-4dfe-931c-5ada964acc0b|You do know who you're quoting, right?
bcf6c2f5-257a-4c47-9d45-5439f70eb8ed|What does he have to do to deserve that?
ed184bbe-f18d-4889-8d42-216792c98cc0|You know you don't deserve it.
844e4e35-cdff-4e89-af1a-9a51c2e41f47|It's not as if he doesn't deserve it.
8e485491-56f0-45e6-acec-943d32f85454|I mean, I actually deserve this.
456b3b09-1e9e-4094-82f2-6207907074de|And why I think you should trust him.
6a2ece4f-87a7-4795-83c4-9ca72db734b3|Same way I know I can trust you.
31a75698-7f36-4f01-bf05-717802375c6b|And to think I didn't trust you.
44f3e0ca-91da-446b-9ea4-8c6ad78b36ed|Yes, but I didn't trust him.
6a7d41e4-3c58-45cd-a171-d72295860802|Yeah, how are we doing with these sales?
78cdab7c-d172-4ce9-aeb3-31970b21ccb9|Come on, we got one sale off right now.
735361f0-b905-4358-9592-1177b992e557|Your sale has been made.
63444357-64e5-4ff1-b9a6-ec526d3b85a2|Check out this house that's for sale.
cd231dfb-83cf-415b-a2ce-ee1465c7b1fd|Do you want layers or just straight?
e62f9c88-e42d-49be-ab3b-f1c35561cf0c|You look at it through another layer of skin.
b793166e-2d0b-49aa-9398-e50a3541d547|Like an onion, without a core there's no layers.
9c73bda2-0032-402f-8603-f9f44ba47e5c|It's got three layers of language.
fccc796d-c555-49f8-8093-82f7635a575b|Look at all these layers of security.
f55c56d1-d820-45a8-8b1a-ca08b0a99152|Shouldn't we telephone the boys about the wedding?
45bcc655-1c1b-49ce-95fc-026ca839e21a|Tell me about the guests at our wedding.
54e3c2bc-76b4-44f5-8cf7-ff0300d3b223|Big wedding or small wedding?
c2b8f1ce-d343-4802-8a92-0b81e1e1f57c|Your father was best man at our wedding.
9cc0b526-7c46-45e3-a323-db9105c77f0a|You actually bought us wedding bands?
e28783f6-fb3a-46f1-97af-01c658af6023|Isn't the wedding her big event?
5890434d-47bc-465c-897d-32cfcc33e3be|Is it a wedding party over there?
9e2445c8-d5ac-4a12-a4ea-1b116d6354ea|Are there wedding bells in your future?
e3e5bcd1-cd03-4db7-b9d1-60bd948e98ad|Where'd you lose my mother's wedding band?
ac448a7a-a420-4456-9fe9-8631044836fe|It's like she's studying some new discovery or something.
31f34c57-8edc-4165-a431-a2ed27b072ae|We weren't presented with it during discovery.
ce84333d-9e81-4b13-983f-39772bb91087|Was she involved in the discovery?
87382d75-c878-4614-87fb-7dcd12829a02|Did he return with a discovery?
c0aa45a1-d31f-4ce5-80ee-82c4f7d5b3bd|Martin, I've made a major discovery!
3ef0ca4a-e3c5-4c16-b919-8677f2b0f3ab|Yeah, but what does mine say?
823c0825-3d64-4075-9e42-98330a020070|He loved his family more than I loved mine.
a9510efa-3519-4597-8ba1-b84a43cd832f|A friend of mine handles it now.
8744a7c8-e671-4761-8e4f-5a829cd21227|Because mine get me out of tickets.
97124941-1bc3-4b0f-a1c1-4051b00667ea|But you were always mine and only mine.
1c7c2af3-54ea-4c75-b61b-2ea120a69e0b|I always think that he's not mine.
4fdb3312-4441-4880-b47a-692486525bf8|It's as if they weren't mine.
be85e806-0f39-41a9-a070-1ab3ac2de449|Didn't take anything that wasn't mine, officer.
22828896-f50a-4697-9174-3a93468f86a0|When are you headed back to the academy?
de60e160-8e3c-4d03-9d3c-a2164c05bc2c|This is not an academy training test.
f8392095-930c-4d98-86d1-93380568073f|Yes, we put them right on the sand.
d16f4837-15b1-4b6f-91a8-bb339860b577|Who likes the feeling of sand in their feet?
3114cf03-2910-49b4-ad99-eab781cd74ef|You didn't get sand in the car.
33639891-a28d-4d69-b669-fae2b1d1be74|I will be forgotten in the sand and time.
fad4da9c-9dd1-4c76-8cf8-334c3eb7c46e|Jim ordered this hit on himself.
9b578f7a-d875-4392-a1cb-4beaa5eae3bd|You've made a big hit this time.
5b07f0b9-43ec-4e8a-b25d-033474cf782e|Maybe we could put a hit on her.
f96b1cbe-0bb7-4c90-98b0-6fc8af1b59c3|I'm sorry, I just, I needed the hit.
322d3f04-083e-4d5e-9868-f8e8b90a50b8|Which is why we're gonna use a missile.
e0dd5c19-8ca1-4446-8bfb-ac2e3ca1fb5e|We haven't launched any missiles yet.
b01940df-e02f-4212-8044-976591158231|The target is within missile range.
00293fac-aa8e-46d4-acec-665a3cc645a8|What did you think was in the missile?
be745560-fc8d-47c8-b195-fc05a9c44bf4|I was not fairly elected to this office.
a20f9136-63dc-4b2c-ba16-46122b62bc5d|We elected our strike committee.
0ed28b20-0bc5-468a-b74e-b84230c8db01|Got myself elected two years back.
35436a4b-560d-4302-a641-bd1abf976273|How hard could getting him elected be?
6b6d0fc5-8e9c-4dd5-bcb1-5bbc1197942a|We're discussing solutions to the climate issue.
0973a04c-b2cd-4d42-bb08-6fa5a31bb1ce|Current climate, we still need more evidence.
8f65f9d0-e213-4f35-8f58-e4559756a187|There is no snow because of climate control.
56894d17-e0cf-4100-ab6b-c23dda9b2fc3|He attacked a big climate conference.
36eee4eb-48dd-4d0c-a44e-98da6eec1553|Yeah, you should probably start carrying a knife.
19cedf47-436c-4d03-8491-839ca85a478c|Here, I'll leave you the knife.
4c529643-d2ab-4423-84b5-632b3877d66c|She's got a knife in her hand.
23efc597-7b86-44df-a431-9f37c7ffcebe|You mean you benefited from the whole family.
72804a45-bd33-41aa-b943-7a7a732f556d|If you were, who stands to benefit from that?
360d2f85-289c-40ef-9e1e-e7f1e94393d8|You argued about who would benefit from your discovery?
9c53fedf-4463-462c-9909-e38101b5d9c2|If the deal dies, then your company doesn't benefit.
f6814a0b-a8b4-4e16-a8bf-1e15614145ba|Who benefits from your death?
ce41b3b5-643f-4783-bc23-9ce641ed4998|The atmosphere is thinner than Earth.
48aa6183-fb1f-4a43-8b54-39d154bc7a2b|And it might improve the atmosphere.
94cdcf42-07cf-49e2-ab73-2b8fdcb1b639|The atmosphere here is thin already.
57c6bf3e-ef3c-4630-a380-180c3a5535ed|I'll put this light on, for atmosphere.
793196aa-fa54-4c50-9e26-7d16b6255257|Four cycle while entering atmosphere.
17c21468-62f7-47ec-9610-335e844d69bc|Would you like to hear me tell a joke?
107253ec-04d8-4e3c-975b-e29a48b36243|Now isn't time for jokes.
02dde649-6a2e-4434-acf5-1ab9f8e546c8|What I said just now, isn't a joke.
68245e59-ecfa-4462-8b35-d6e7b612f4e0|I'll kill you if this is a joke.
7391c9cf-2e19-46b5-8ac2-9ac17b69e189|And now I urge you to pay attention.
a0734f20-9a6d-4ff0-a86d-96fa270d068d|We urge all of you to find your families.
47a7898e-b0b0-4098-847a-8ca7ff1d9265|You urged me to be by her side.
cf520a3c-3a26-4866-8297-5b311b3e4cf8|Can't we put him in an ordinary bed?
50e09e7a-0d2e-46fe-834f-359be0651920|This is no ordinary man.
400e222a-354a-47eb-848d-870020d0844c|He didn't feel what ordinary people feel.
92dc52f4-ea36-4065-a8fe-aab83e76a925|I told you, I'm not very visual.
a7fceb72-4b09-4fb7-9459-513d819f1ade|I lost all visual on the security cameras.
20f7b600-f1bb-45ec-92cf-5638a350c89a|Do you have a visual yet?
eed641b7-d5ec-4cae-bf06-7da638b7c1d2|Trying to get a visual inside the house.
0ed36979-bcf6-464d-bcb0-e3872498ffb0|Who has visual on the package?
27998458-1cc7-4fe5-b3a5-593ec3767e79|I took and published numerous photos.
8ff3f06a-dea8-4fd5-9c8b-acd353160999|We probably crossed paths numerous times.
2527fa44-740b-48d4-b740-e336c0816ac0|Numerous reports of trouble outside, some of it him.
aa55c4ec-6ae9-4b72-8f93-481b80353d85|He's threatened my life on numerous occasions.
1dba3b37-4048-4ffd-8e4f-c0ff1ebc31f2|I was, on occasion, with Anne's sister, Mary?
694f1bda-b9f9-460b-a18c-1d2f159448fa|This is your last occasion with my family.
42b75c22-e36a-429c-aa94-3d84e73cf1be|Alex, this is a family occasion!
7c7e1949-8b73-419c-aa70-63f2d4467a20|I've told him at least on two occasions.
d458fab4-f61f-4578-b5dd-8091fcd08e7c|What kind of philosophy is that?
80740601-5017-43b5-8e8b-bbead223f6e6|Why should I help on a suicide mission?
fc7b5042-7f69-40ac-b2d1-25169e857560|There was no need for a suicide run.
ae392278-41c2-4d62-ab4f-f84425c9beeb|Is she on suicide watch?
5a524a1c-f463-4e22-8c6e-dac635ab26f7|My first case, my first death, was a suicide.
47846a5f-7f26-4fff-bffe-f02c1fd1e2f2|Well, tell her you shall.
38589d7a-ee8b-45eb-9ea8-2a63422bdd12|We shall leave you now.
af365f21-eb27-4523-92ef-73bc19967ee1|I'll show you how to use this, shall I?
822634be-4823-45b4-ad69-94dd298e5c16|I'm just really glad to be here.
e93dd530-db48-4d77-b0a5-6b88562bb460|I think he was glad we caught him.
042297d8-2e4c-4a6d-ba3a-f9486d8d8faf|Glad things are working out for someone around here.
35720e4c-d776-4496-8f5e-df933b9357d5|I'm really glad you're going with me.
f8c714de-89b0-4839-abd4-21c4e816252d|Well, I must say, I'm glad to hear that.
7b2499ce-d20e-4ca9-82c8-b163b9570332|I'm glad you guys have each other.
3df139be-81c8-41e6-8026-db587f8102e8|I'm glad I spent it with you.
719c1760-0836-48b3-a8c2-ce9ab42f3c6c|Even stolen goods don't sell like before.
aaefb722-e0fd-4085-aad8-dc795374b552|He did time for handling stolen goods.
85f33b0c-1f88-4ed1-9a87-46c92aa638c2|Moreover, it was pouring with rain.
7981b920-388a-4dd2-b290-b84014a14f4e|Moreover, this ball is visited by many foreign visitors.
e3dfaf43-69f7-4641-9197-cb47f56d85f0|Moreover, I just wanted to feel the cold atmosphere.
2f18af60-0432-4eee-996e-1a8f2edbe797|Well, get your coat on, then.
cee461f9-7c23-4e07-9f37-c477df14d162|Go and get your coats quickly, then.
01328ad3-51e6-4abe-80e1-375e86af162f|Only people in white coats sit there.
14037947-8a7d-4e61-bba7-96a6696aa204|You can take his coat as well.
4180756f-de7e-481b-b69f-68521e1c59df|Could someone get me a coat?
0cbe7fff-2cad-437f-a577-734df5350699|Give me alcohol, it's there.
13c6aa54-e4e7-4c47-b43f-2553f4ea153b|Which also means no alcohol, guys.
faf7e4fc-1132-4974-8636-f4925b06263d|Better known as wood alcohol.
b25dfb3f-d127-4661-9ed9-fdb813464446|But here's the odd thing about wood alcohol.
0916bfe7-0f62-408e-a320-0e1233586fd4|No matter what I say, he says the opposite.
e2aeaed1-cbdc-4b86-a89b-1e7cca869cbf|We're on opposite sides, but we're true friends.
9ac4a1ba-8726-49c5-8bdd-db0739e4ba6c|That's exactly the opposite of what we need.
d40f95a7-79eb-4ae5-9105-e512537236f3|They live on opposite sides of town.
d202aee0-8343-4a93-95a1-0e73e8d41d49|Okay, you look like a cop.
324dc0a8-4f7e-493e-a2b7-da6bf1d2bae7|Just wait for the cops to come.
54316397-eced-4c19-b73e-77147309176c|Okay, but this guy is a cop.
58bc4324-bf71-4aca-98e5-4f05d030ae1c|I really think we should call the cops.
4632dd65-dbff-4cf0-a224-7d1b50f16c9c|It's funny how all cops love that one.
a4134ada-a289-4c17-a6eb-ea7ef07045bc|And that's the universe where I was born.
7bbc6a80-6352-4332-8e15-9b3e9e2b9362|The universe will sing you to your sleep.
b86398db-5a74-4688-9536-86fd6c191ad8|It tells us how the universe began.
50801ed2-80e8-4679-bc7d-b3bb77153b34|Because that's how I see the universe.
11dc6f3a-dcdd-4d4a-b726-f3b60203cdda|You should've let it breathe.
296b9748-9624-4aac-ad88-34297d7addda|Even the very air she breathed.
dc29bf9f-6a41-4051-8a30-d7254665da8f|Everybody still breathing back there?
45d14482-ab77-45f0-a1a9-32c085c03461|Then you're gonna breathe out for four seconds.
dc762ef6-2a19-4503-8dac-d0b064275b7a|She's breathing on her own.
b3c19545-068e-4ab1-9724-e5edee3addbf|You call that being practical?
f0d9945b-256e-4ac8-a132-3bc11baf0de2|It's just that he's not practical.
8399fc5e-fbb1-4662-a959-43b66ca926d6|I draw the line at therapy.
78138bb2-3b79-455a-8b2d-0ff340971297|Don't even start me about therapy.
58d2c4f9-6dc3-4896-a87e-6fcd8219d443|You know how I feel about therapy.
d9302f45-e87b-44c2-a272-488161a283e4|Think they'll do therapy in pairs?
4745e121-e4e2-45e3-971b-a7025032ac1c|Well, I got to get to my shift.
57883256-317a-4536-8079-f455dc461a22|I'm on shift work now.
56828572-fb65-485b-bb3e-f2a7c3a5d3cd|The hospital says he was on night shift.
c9656642-bb93-46c9-819c-ba17200ad408|That's one hell of a racial profile.
fea92e54-f0cd-42d1-97ff-30e00075f36a|The racial and gender numbers are worrying.
3b2329a9-d6e6-4488-93a9-8bb47e75ff38|Enormous difficulty developing any racial, ethnic or cultural identity.
8c2d4bf2-1ef2-4e56-ad88-80d63ceb5766|He crosses racial and social lines, ages, too.
34b5e1ec-ddf0-4648-b432-7d8137e718d7|Everyone wants to take this to a racial place.
f0696f18-4b81-4340-ba89-d9e58612b5cd|Also, there's pleasure to be found elsewhere.
fbbe454a-0219-47cf-9f80-27991fd80124|That's just money that could be better spent elsewhere.
ba0083ea-4681-4430-91c4-d1a7c82cf904|We could have slept elsewhere.
e9a7a859-28ef-4956-b587-f309eec9fb89|Yes, but I'd already seen him elsewhere this morning.
0f0eed65-ae1b-4239-91e6-1e9dc2321180|For cops, it rarely happens.
fda7d748-2a72-4cbf-96e1-f5a7a9534ace|I said, I rarely do it.
d172f3c2-12e0-4f52-8ecf-fb5cae5ea6e7|Oh, we rarely left the room.
8fa63c3d-abf0-4de4-85ef-22429d23b9bc|All hospitals are essentially the same.
5beafb88-be34-481a-8155-4c07beafdf80|I mean, the project essentially does not exist.
e7ea4426-4fc9-4861-9411-5083895ffff5|So, essentially, it never moved.
3ffd80d9-f0ef-46bc-aa8b-292d5976d29f|This essentially proves they're innocent.
e1f7914c-b0a4-4fe7-8a05-624b69bf69a4|That means discipline over every part of your life.
a7514995-a3c9-4f1c-8418-0fa20d0da137|No discipline to take over the business.
ad58549e-8e36-479d-8411-11253c513afa|Kid like that needs some discipline.
0fb77f4a-c5e7-48ed-93b2-0e2c3b1aecb0|My dad would discipline him.
afe9aab2-c270-44ae-9a00-858218b7bce1|Once she wrote to me, but I never replied.
8a8f15e2-4e72-4d49-b383-2ce36fb152a7|I'm going to reply to him, of course.
6cecd45a-2711-4134-9ed9-d19e5837aa8e|And do you know what he replies?
bf444cff-1fbf-4251-bcc5-5319f2181061|Well, she wouldn't have replied.
93b6d49a-f49b-4256-89bf-8d688454e746|Good luck with your Mexican baby story.
79999103-cfa1-49dd-93ed-30bc3c157e7d|There is nothing worse than a Mexican with glasses.
5c4d53c1-32fa-4761-9290-52197f7df7de|It appears we share the same passions.
443ec153-26df-47e4-ba45-d032b53fbf18|I tell you what, it's a proper passion killer.
48c5bbee-8d9c-418c-9566-f86d469ee785|What can you buy with fire and passion?
71710366-1f10-415b-98f1-ebd1556c1806|I heard tales of it as a child.
729c5fc5-c451-4f15-ac3e-543dc6587789|Good detail makes for a good tale.
568cf32e-9e77-42ae-8c24-affa6080951d|This tale is what brought me to this place.
5ebc92b2-89c4-4db6-b0ce-89429cd4c959|Dead men tell no tales.
43e4bbe5-1a24-4b12-abab-afa2122651cb|My dark tales have burnt into your soul.
2baa075a-aeb3-4ec1-ac5f-2c4ca223f5da|Yeah, so much dust can collect in a day.
c3942685-a541-4d97-8e2c-c563c69689eb|Look at the dust on this.
60d4662c-8b52-437f-8186-e41b99eca9c0|Then we can all be together, dust to dust.
547dd7b9-28e1-4b63-b909-81aaf3d651f4|You can't even kiss me?
ab60f402-7dab-485b-a984-fce7de5dbcf7|There we kissed each other.
c8800905-b3c3-47a7-bbe8-db04b4ec4ac7|Then I got to pass the iron.
40bec579-12e3-4678-be08-d6655407d8f5|Oh, she has a ship, I have an iron.
f635b79c-370c-498e-bcd5-38a22f527c7e|I wasn't looking at the iron print.
5317e3fc-fb01-4981-bcd6-6606106fb93e|Are you sure she didn't try to contact you?
a843440a-c4d7-46d0-8445-0fe68dbec01a|I don't contact him after then.
0f761c02-8838-44d4-b866-1d56fc5c784b|Well, we will need to contact them.
bfeaea2a-a393-496a-b60e-2d6b5811e84b|Until she contacts someone we won't know.
fed015a4-278f-4f29-856a-d15c0cc3ee63|But I want you to do it in Spanish.
e4274ef2-e4bf-4fdc-9833-4d6674c431af|Lisa and I have yet to learn Spanish.
219fa6db-9946-42d4-8deb-dfe2876e4d38|I didn't know you were Spanish.
a47f2faa-ea6e-489c-80c6-5b9b25ea429c|Apparently, he only speaks Spanish.
c2d8c13a-e8ce-4b7f-afac-95ad80402f97|My parents hated when I spoke Spanish.
5eb380ac-85a5-4b4c-88f7-6dc8eb292e77|Come in from the right, advance while firing.
e47fe075-81b7-4d92-9072-ae6ceaeff098|He's at the scene with the advance team.
27517f95-3cf5-4cea-823d-422f9803f938|Looks like it's Christmas in advance.
7f2a7933-eac3-47e1-9a47-41e0e21a7039|But you pay in advance.
006b3397-6749-4576-94d3-23653670e0e0|So, are you sure you just want the pot?
576e9f5b-a0c8-4bd3-a22a-65e9f96b18f6|I'm selling pot for the summer.
d3b4de17-3f09-4447-aeaa-aeee4002b127|I'm gonna go not smoke pot.
1ff8aaf9-86e2-48bd-ad1a-cc6c0d28e309|Then, we smoked some pot.
d87f4241-c305-40d6-8ffe-ef7d5ce113d1|I'll make you a nice pot of coffee!
1e91a60b-6e94-4126-885e-85ce33b42f8b|Potatoes don't grow so well, do they?
c7fb0ff6-0743-4b93-a84d-6964fbe0d69a|Tomorrow we're gonna blow up a sweet potato!
74c75657-71ab-4a96-ad15-9732a8df91bc|That's like eating one potato chip.
19382557-1414-4a73-9bc2-c35c4fdfee9f|I think they want to steal your motor.
cac19be8-8821-4340-a8be-2e63310fdf4d|Keep your motor running, baby.
0dfd750f-a6f3-4413-bc7f-ad9d4afd1022|No phones, no lights, no motor cars.
f3cfd432-8197-4169-9b69-cc3dd5664a2b|I have to pack my things for France.
76b20a02-af31-4402-91c3-1b2991194420|It was so strange, packing up my room.
a5397679-8a3c-4d87-9743-c9f34ee21002|Me too, and I'm not even packed yet.
603f22a7-0a40-4fa7-a698-2a73fb8b4c6c|Anywhere else, it might dominate.
78c6059c-0983-4f6b-962a-d2d8ba871f46|I can see a world where humans dominate again.
52e42975-2db0-43b1-b6af-4c174f66a60d|Why did they need marketing, they're amazing.
8e6edfff-ffb6-4f13-b456-474de4475f87|Richard, we've tried marketing at trade shows.
21979873-feb1-4a69-bff9-31a9021723bd|Did you study marketing in college?
6335fcee-5011-4b55-a2c3-5a56f4269a87|It's just this whole evening was a disaster.
4ef057e6-f18d-4d57-92ef-130074594fec|This is a disaster for you.
e2adf974-ce6d-42cc-8e3a-3a82d31a2b32|But last night was a disaster.
c07be3eb-ff3b-4f25-b39a-eedded9b8263|There's been too much exposure here.
0a587fe8-ad2b-4690-9f31-468b880c15cf|Exposure can kill as easily as a knife.
7b2ce506-850d-4969-a674-553c76f0ed0b|No, we're gonna die of exposure.
49c1ecdd-d840-4b2e-8998-02aff3a85c65|Now he's three blocks away with little public exposure.
088d3692-b76f-4366-aded-03c0bcd6ad0d|This is my third capping in three months.
4e463854-8d12-43bf-8fbf-ae020a8afa39|The cap thing's a nice touch, though.
d4fc628c-5a32-45c3-b75e-26e8d533d3f0|You left the baseball cap behind?
1ef43439-bd94-4498-b8f9-329ee452a4da|I would put my cap on.
b4544cf7-0b5d-4f4d-9dbb-98e936cc38d0|He's right there, in the blue jacket!
94e16ee6-be22-4dc2-8c90-2515e3cd8ea8|I'm not even gonna put on my jacket.
6fd3cc7d-c6ef-4c50-97e5-8dc753e87f58|Why don't you just ask for the jacket back?
9f65fdca-3ee9-4b63-aff8-ab6fd9868e49|I can smell it from your jacket.
f168da38-aec2-4d52-8db7-4681fc198292|It's the only solution for this intense cold.
7c5c29ac-c717-43b3-9bc5-3a95f0945423|Your floor contacts must be intense.
6db20f81-a3ac-48dd-a647-55b9c579cd81|That were intense, weren't it?
424a30a3-d1ff-46b6-8db7-f5f0a3396e90|A very intense feeling of being back home.
f45cebb0-7bae-4451-baaa-815cf0eb098e|Haven't you been in touch with him?
fdc9cd93-5a48-40da-9315-52a7481a0916|Oh, did he get in touch with you?
e6d98056-7a5a-4141-8db2-684578334606|No, we just kind of lost touch.
c28eb75d-c640-4b1b-adb5-dbb3806ac29f|But you are in touch with them?
c255a10b-629b-4be9-b957-8a9eeac49757|You sure I won't be imposing?
f4f495ba-b3d5-4b05-b868-1132cec70ff9|The government are imposing cuts across the whole sector.
749ca547-c0a1-4226-8895-737d398a55f7|She imposes on him her way of loving.
6f9b1e5f-d9c8-4735-ab20-7147407cec9f|We have an electric key system.
882210cf-39ab-4143-9635-0783ccbeec93|I gave you warning with an electric shock.
b17a9242-a900-42fa-898c-4750a1bf053b|I also have an electric car.
6af21e7a-ec48-46a4-8980-58b071b9d40c|We don't have security cameras or electric fences.
1c1d2c16-8589-4c25-8815-a475fde4db54|I also need financial support to implement expansion.
62f1634a-bf37-4e62-851c-28a6d7dfeff7|And he began to implement these policies.
af94dc18-699e-480c-a4bf-7bbc9619bc3f|As a rule, I don't analyze friends.
e54a2bbd-0271-4b10-9f6c-532680885ffb|I'll have the crime lab analyze it.
a4ef1576-0920-45b9-ab16-f3b2302f6ef8|We just analyze it, predict it.
1b77962a-b1e3-42c9-b309-c623618f405b|Are you sure it's her blood?
2dd36c33-43fd-4c2e-aa44-6f5178ce0323|I'm sure you were expecting me sooner or later.
e03e09d1-5d39-432b-ac42-421b670f3c87|I'm sure he tells you everything.
1ea3f4ee-7640-43df-b5ee-64b0b027341a|But he sure had a way with words.
415dfb47-4ab5-42ad-a989-71bfd9958dcf|You are retiring, starting now.
98366578-59ba-444d-9bf0-e06884b76a93|He's really retired so quickly?
1357563b-2114-4ddd-92b7-238fef21902f|It says here you're retired.
6a2c534c-004e-48d3-b8b2-9a53c8e20c83|What my husband means to say is, we're retiring.
22f05758-9289-4a16-a6c1-06f6a2b2d18c|I quit my job and live the retired life.
e125dc42-6434-468d-9a24-e5024687bea9|You'll be carrying an attention deficit into the day.
2bc20544-4df5-49c3-9e04-42efed688951|It's just that there is a campaign deficit involved.
62d2a37f-fbeb-4ec3-b0f7-81088421a4a0|That question itself reflects a certain attitude deficit.
0faabb1c-d19f-4034-a19d-8f835af832b1|Then a deficit of something shows up there.
537b7f7d-f78d-4499-bd05-b31a23a96a40|Well, I could sort out the budget deficit.
09457e7d-db61-41b0-9acc-cd6394ec1929|Yeah, but it was just for emphasis.
ed8aad0e-f1af-4086-b603-6d566b1b0758|You place far too much emphasis on talking.
5832bf37-9cbf-4d69-95ff-e3c713de8ae4|That he failed to accomplish, ending up in prison.
7ba36055-2fca-4a0a-80ed-de878d28baf6|That is what I've come here to accomplish.
12351074-7860-46ba-ae46-32ac8435d9ee|We haven't accomplished everything we set out to do.
068aa603-f42c-4c9b-a625-cab881b78bc0|And what's he trying to accomplish?
2a65bb4d-a5be-4bf0-9cfa-f703a58ccced|This issue has been before the council previously.
0524ce30-f4da-44e0-b2ff-c80ac94496b8|That is the man from previously, right?
15738089-efed-4b7a-afc2-4f65d9a35d95|Does that look like a symbol?
86ed673f-3f22-4cb1-a45a-f680c7483bdd|We are symbols of power, sitting in our offices.
e0e8a2e5-f962-4f71-b8a0-5f8bf9765e4b|Do you recognize the symbol drawn on the mirror?
2dd8d02e-92a2-4244-9f93-66967bd9c5db|They made you look like a sex symbol.
3c962af7-aad4-4ff4-953d-38f28f4db1e3|Been with the bureau ever since, sir.
3851efc4-ff13-4502-8c90-293d14b8164b|What is your bureau doing about that?
d397f9dc-48af-47f6-8717-18dccfcdd39a|Big critic of the bureau for years.
bfeff684-e48b-47e1-a128-db9a5fc92f7f|I have had it with the better business bureau!
b9785024-71a6-4ac0-a268-ea40106ab5b2|It's a perfect laboratory space, wouldn't you say?
e3aa80f0-fcfb-46ee-acb0-c757ce99cd02|That boy was created in a laboratory.
0fb1efff-bdec-469f-a7b4-fb2d27d26ded|Get ready, we're going to laboratory.
604de3f4-2a51-4479-bd6e-f1fb44fbb504|I wouldn't exactly call this attached.
2ebe0523-9c4b-4ab8-b793-119918ac51a5|You seem attached to this patient.
ea34fb5e-1d09-4f89-a7d8-ca9ed0fc5925|Won't you be attached to it then?
a1b648d7-5884-429d-aa49-edce8790a06f|There are no strings attached, I promise.
56638ae7-dc49-453e-86b9-7a45e8d9526a|Maybe you can do it whenever you want.
fd6233ce-0632-4ca7-9358-fdfeb0cc59f0|He lets me use it whenever I need it.
5c0a6fdd-6a2d-4643-8747-8ecc0b60fe15|Whenever you use it, think of me.
ddfd85f7-5946-46f6-95c4-729c1c813ed6|Whenever you're ready to come back you just say.
3fbebe2e-d1c1-4e46-8580-321ec2f622ce|Sometimes, a mark is just a mark.
aa19fc7f-4f9e-42ea-91f0-6130a51a9717|You buy me a drink, I'll make my mark.
2f90fcc3-49b2-4f3a-8c87-83f794f0737c|I give you full marks for that.
56308986-1b06-4567-8c87-8b1d57bcd115|Let's see the marks Alex left on you.
454cad3a-6c38-4555-a0f5-10a0ff2fcc67|We're not calling it suicide here, mark.
c2f137e8-c4a6-4546-b88b-b25e54b8fe7a|I'm in shock over David's actions.
e03fcb0f-8d1c-40f9-bad2-20cf7d295724|It's quite common with shock.
dff079bc-bfc6-4327-9d07-e7a5dd78585e|And this news is a shock to me, too.
c2bd77cb-971b-4245-8659-355105296a03|This must be quite a shock for you.
909a5c2f-d491-4b29-b01e-d6074e69f3da|He's in some kind of shock.
63f3bf8a-1985-44b4-8657-29162d75b33a|Oh, and you may wanna adjust your dress.
e067b285-6b5c-48cb-a36b-e87d7da4a91f|Let me just adjust it here.
82189bdd-7021-4c80-903e-c0278b84c614|You'll have to ask my employer.
030ebe4f-6ca6-4045-b56c-8d3f65df8cda|This is what your employer has not told you.
6c259c93-970c-423f-bb19-bda7bea0b1c4|You must win back your employer's trust.
332cb33e-0b99-48af-9349-75df835a0b79|My employers know you're here.
8582789b-bc62-4d20-aa60-9eeb181c3e37|Well, what are you gonna tell your employer?
85eb5349-3a3c-4a0d-841c-c924ea7a778b|The only visible door leads to nowhere.
011d79f9-97ff-4c5e-b6c6-c46e3c3fadc9|And this is a high profile, very visible space.
9ae8fe6a-86db-49ba-8eff-82dc13092a33|Just cover the ones that will be visible.
8f6783db-f2dc-419c-ac78-cc121fc02d5f|Make it visible in the salary.
94bd570d-178a-4320-9e4a-be1dd97fc191|Do not make me bear witness to your passing.
15c0b4d9-4711-479a-a822-80bc06976d5a|And know that I may ask for the passes?
4a56908d-dc5c-4d00-ba04-41bc1a8c8125|I'm sure it's just a passing storm.
14d767a1-64b6-4ec8-8fbd-f5e151837342|Make it look like car trouble for anybody passing.
76226a49-5a85-418e-ac23-46d162e6f2db|She is not having an easy passing.
0e361d76-5707-4808-904f-f90bd864892a|You will be the last two priests to go.
970d2509-b76a-4ad5-bd61-f5f583dc6481|Isn't that what you do with those priests?
54a8b5c6-e95b-4122-bd1d-97510d6922f1|Never heard of a priest like that!
9fb0be95-76ef-4dbb-9203-5d4f2172d65d|Two, get him to volunteer, which he won't.
e69f4fc3-3235-4527-9c5a-a91eab75efb0|Yeah, she was one of the volunteers, I think.
6a820278-aa8a-46c6-8855-8dafd9d2fd07|For my first act, I'll require a volunteer.
dd5304d5-a48c-4fe9-a990-44f45f643deb|What do you say we break that habit?
1b26aed9-7b5d-4b48-bf9f-23e88576ad0d|I still had a few bad habits.
27cb3149-0c05-4627-9fbb-9790b4e68bf0|When did you pick up that habit?
73b4fc3d-1ed9-49d2-b268-a5a7b470cb88|When are you going to stop this habit?
883ec93c-aeb9-41b1-b48d-63c61587ca59|You were managing your son's drug habit?
81702a30-9b64-463b-9b68-523f8c052b45|It's just to illustrate how serious I am.
f13b8b3c-d11d-41a1-a943-7f655ca9597a|That he could illustrate that really clearly.
d568badf-a7a4-4d9d-96d0-88e86a1ffc24|I think I like them both equally.
78f26d6a-0f33-469d-ad74-c074c9f5da88|I love all my children equally.
855d60d1-0c44-4648-aa31-224fd624dffe|And we'll work that case equally hard, too.
6ad284fa-f8b0-4292-860f-7e5d75179faf|Now we get paid equally.
ec95bbf9-a6af-41fe-808d-92681139fa97|Some bluer prospect if they can get it.
2a2d0220-354d-45ee-ba98-128f44a5e439|That I have no prospect and no hope?
2f9d1245-b04c-4d74-9ef2-cb9bec51fe00|It said that he had enhanced your survival skills.
120520c5-aeaf-470e-9d3a-c15a0a3fa6f8|How soon can you find out if it's enhanced?
0a26e8ef-b69b-4c3a-923f-28061057aa77|And your memory capacity will be enhanced.
7c6257e9-e504-46ac-8d7e-af15d404e86a|But she is very severe.
1e92e602-27f4-4b30-827c-6f223efbdd36|I know severe stress when I see it.
f5201959-cafe-4351-adbe-3cdb2c47e027|The shock wave caused severe damage and she sank.
ba1cf3b7-259b-4c8a-9d27-fa2912b8e295|This call may be monitored for quality purposes.
94489ad9-8156-44b8-a7b8-deab7ce03de7|They don't monitor this room, you know.
18effbf0-f3c7-4362-bce8-4e307d74c2c2|This has been the most amazing month.
e1fbe636-b9f0-4fd4-93a4-931bc88ddb62|What an amazing job, don't you think?
1f1f2813-a918-4fa5-8a0f-3950d3ea02bf|This tracking thing is amazing.
c3025874-1981-4ce3-853b-bb31d8043e04|That was great, that was amazing.
08872136-0155-4c1f-8de0-6b109c7cf358|It's all about looking amazing.
b4da9711-1379-4114-984a-0f13feadbd66|It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.
34c19144-c57b-4e23-aafe-6e0e831be6fb|It's amazing you do all these different things.
96e9cd88-ca47-4cb5-8736-82271227fed2|He says that we will live in poverty.
4addf475-e24d-4324-ba0d-c0e6dad026a1|But he was pretty great on class and poverty.
834011b5-6c25-4fab-8720-e3712f3f3e4c|A tough life in all that poverty.
c2865d92-025b-49cc-aa12-2a5fd12f5d57|Well, maybe poverty will inspire you.
e3d0d6e4-651e-491e-8aa7-e210291dafc0|You just marry a drug boss or something.
11165698-a3bc-4545-b78b-50df04269613|He was our boss for a long, long time.
9ba67262-84bc-470f-80ef-12d231665c6a|Save a little bit for us, boss.
42bba59a-fd3c-4270-8b1e-7b38be787ebf|But your bosses still don't know the truth.
623afa73-79a4-4716-9848-dc92119e26cd|I know, but I got inspired.
5113bc76-0832-4fe3-ad31-26433b0bdc05|Inspired is when you think you can do anything.
cf498279-9af0-4392-a356-c4ffa8f39f2b|What did it inspire you to do, kill somebody?
f110662f-8178-4587-8e9c-4a864e283c4f|He inspired it in me.
048a0a7e-3164-44bb-b596-e1c7b8daa09e|They share our belief, our anger.
e2c0f6c9-54eb-46cf-acc2-237d78538375|You think Roger has anger issues?
3382a6c4-e0fd-4e20-9bd4-b52f65f450cd|The girl has serious anger issues.
5b87aa61-8b9c-44f8-9f00-b1f143aea909|It doesn't feel like an anger killing.
f2f0833f-8ec3-46c5-86ec-03c74bc6f2cc|There are heavily armed men just outside that door.
a3d9f58a-9e6a-4c5f-952b-f96432ca53c0|He was tall and heavily built.
c5329f3f-20f7-4bec-97a9-b8232f8b8fe4|His death weighs heavily on my heart.
127afdef-5156-4b91-9d8a-893d31f67ad6|Well, you very heavily implied it.
4c88eb19-5b14-4bff-8325-fc44649ac51f|Don't like parking it on the street.
0e325ee0-db8b-4dbf-aae6-376129447c9e|Tell me more about them parking spaces.
e500fc05-ebfd-479a-9060-95ed803fd0b3|It's a new way of parking the car.
a013a857-d822-49e4-a6b0-9e08ea263640|I've been parking there for two months.
b019cf7d-97ef-40ef-b910-5545efd955d9|Didn't turn up any prints around his neck.
ee364b74-e95c-4243-9bd9-be1c9b3ef6c2|Prints only take us so far.
93a37a00-7560-4618-9808-5bf7f397e9f8|I tell you, it won't print.
e3468f10-8489-4626-9a1a-74803193672d|Running his prints right now.
98da0967-a0cb-4624-be65-dba7763338e4|Did you pick up the print?
73f4ba38-5d2e-4b80-aea8-cf2db79c3750|Get ready to meet your maker.
4759dca1-f881-44ce-b619-d5ce86c17b67|As your maker I release you.
79dab044-dd4d-4be2-bde2-6794a467b4a4|They're literally gonna meet their maker.
438799d5-66df-4192-b124-b56084496475|Get it fixed before this guy meets his maker.
6a7d0343-7e8a-4904-9bc7-8e44026fceaa|It's time to meet your maker.
2235c7bf-9bee-4337-825e-71f4a870ceb7|You were also kind of a queen, right?
8c58281b-60ca-48d6-bc1d-2d763feaa9b3|Then how come you're the queen going to jail?
b941d271-d383-484b-93f1-5d37ea065793|I thought that's queen, match the king.
43a2a095-3c68-4fb8-8a29-75bc548fa2ad|Not until you get the king and queen, right?
56f98441-edf0-4be7-ad8d-1d0b3e92554a|You can see she has excellent genes.
2246f4b3-646c-4d77-95d4-78acaf208ac2|I think she's got some of your genes.
9f1022e5-1dce-4544-b9bd-75f8d68e16c1|I have really good genes.
841b92de-f794-4093-a3d6-16ec417ec90c|They made her from some of your genes.
8f95b2a9-5606-4520-bf9f-7801b862c0b3|It's a problem, because my grades can vary.
bd372fe3-91fb-4d76-b3b5-8203993004b9|They vary, but they were always tied to Mary.
7d99c568-41f2-4d92-a4e6-402f97f477e9|Speed can vary so much.
27e9d6a0-3e7a-49ab-a32f-07d568d8f963|In varying color, but they look like me.
6bff3e2d-9f89-4231-a8fa-c39ff23e1393|Maybe I could find her a new gallery.
1a618199-89af-440d-834d-d96ed432802d|No, we finished the gallery last month.
48dd0783-1c87-49cc-b683-a262fbaf31b3|I know, but you can evaluate her.
d595f92d-a1cb-4535-81d3-1f109a1c2de1|Let us judge and evaluate him behind your back.
e8131f20-c2ed-4df4-be3a-df05006f9b77|Look at this fat boy.
7d7d0d6a-24d1-4bd5-9f7e-d17e4bd2d71b|She was so fat I couldn't see the bed!
6a3237fd-d942-4e41-98ff-de864cf9c790|We would grow old and fat together.
cf401145-b6a7-4c1c-8abd-bec89b147d40|But they trade in hope.
b6691343-e337-4067-a14e-cef66738f1d4|I'm thinking about trading it in.
657c0d78-59d0-4fe2-b153-a6c399741b9a|Since when do we trade on blind faith?
eaa9d83c-c6b6-4316-986a-f4a0335fcc14|We were supposed to trade him for Joan.
52cd0643-8dc7-4295-a79c-eb42f9e1a55f|Do you think she should transfer?
6fdd985b-4749-46c5-844c-846b60350324|And some have been transferred.
c33d92bf-e9fc-4856-a2f8-bf01d0aa9acc|I heard they might have to transfer him.
b1a57cba-befe-4e14-81ab-fd584355ffe2|He doesn't exercise or eat right.
558a5a7c-917a-46cf-a66e-3d50226b4a1a|I thought kids didn't exercise these days!
986993bb-a2ab-4cdf-9290-7615a2b3b90d|I need to get to exercise more.
bfe67e90-217c-4c24-9ece-66a932c59b73|Can we exercise the dogs together again?
1f8e6f90-3eb1-41fd-8f79-8fe7db037dd1|You're even more quiet than usual tonight.
58a11552-1dea-46c0-a33d-7ce9bf763e97|No, he just wanted the same as usual.
0c40210e-13fd-49ff-8c1b-bda81b52bc76|A lot more so than usual.
58423f05-be9d-4290-9c18-0d7be8146213|But as usual, nobody listens.
22bb57fa-20e0-4c4e-91ec-100c1966348d|He probably told this mystery flower girl.
6d3e69b2-e7fc-49f8-9573-24463785e96e|Like, there's no engine in the mystery machine!
f51384e4-398a-4f9e-b3a8-fbe18853f01c|You're making a mystery where nothing exists.
9287c693-1c01-463d-ac33-503dc3703838|Well, there is no great mystery.
70c7a0fa-1ff0-4d7d-b93b-e3a4963439a6|Right, so it's a bit of a mystery.
82a01b38-960d-4d5b-ad73-5ccd8fbb8f18|Did you check for signs of forced entry?
1ae3491c-8a54-406e-9bae-6db546825a3b|Well, I couldn't love this entry any more.
4c039cde-3467-47a3-b8a4-54f2a1d3c98f|My ship will be the entry fee.
0e023f1e-1e2b-45f9-bc12-85061c8b3999|How did you gain entry?
70e72562-fe59-4c38-91ce-0b8c6bdd693f|We don't have an entry point.
b2196fe1-0333-4be8-942c-6e83c6345da0|My ears were ringing for a couple days.
4d306be7-7634-49a9-bb4a-52c080981c1f|Yes, but only she rang back.
26950a27-1f26-4cb7-9f62-aabbb323b9a9|Why does that ring a bell?
18ac3c99-42d5-4391-a9b8-1c81c2e3f5ea|I wonder who I should ring first.
87def865-5d3f-4370-976a-4d6a0782c666|Any of those names ring a bell?
96f981c7-6076-41f0-b06f-3a64340dfeac|Tomorrow you'll be in a better mood.
5f86a476-9939-4d0d-ad34-52dfaee5fa1a|Is he in a good mood or not?
edfb7059-2d3e-4e55-afb5-d0c3905f5098|You seem to be in a good mood today.
0de188ed-ce72-4b98-9c40-eb11e21a93b5|Not in your best mood, are you?
93cbc6dd-676d-48d6-b92e-6faedecb2b5c|Stop destroying the mood every time!
50b869c7-c1bc-4788-9e28-76f096325670|I told you I was sick of beans.
ad42f533-d5a8-4618-ae0b-f79064be7c96|Well, it's good to see you, old bean.
091f8b79-c7e1-4c4f-bd0c-79e49e4343b9|We mustn't give up our beans!
827b99bd-b871-4255-b56f-881f172edf05|And we'll cook some nice beans, too.
14229537-deff-453f-b5b3-685619372884|That isn't even the real objective.
6c76148e-b8f3-4d07-9a8b-391706659922|Because it seems we have the same objective.
7fdbebdc-c59e-4cfd-a324-eceeb15a5600|Still, you don't know what Henry is capable of.
1a9739ee-4c72-4f5e-9b02-1f632fe97b9e|We're capable of having those different thoughts.
66a62b02-7ddf-49af-bd6d-bc04323698b2|I didn't know what he was capable of.
b9b876e3-61ee-4767-b09d-661a77417a7f|They're to be kept under constant watch.
e74855fe-1eb0-4082-977a-af7978add34a|Even then, it's a constant battle.
8968b023-9958-4e45-9c8c-813ef6346bdd|She was like this constant ringing in your ears.
4952e7cf-6663-48c9-a8b8-487ed173e8a0|You are a constant source of surprise.
53f0917c-445d-4eb9-8de8-223d1bf636a7|When you arrived, her whole face lit up.
29c808fb-ee42-40a4-bf16-3a233d8fdc25|You look all lit up inside.
d203fba7-9cfd-4816-8349-89a81ddcb916|Yeah, it lights up or plays music or something.
d1a8128a-f9b5-47c6-b764-7fddf864b8af|The screens just lit up red!
eefd2d88-670c-4d53-ada6-2badeebf582f|I try to be substance based, not style based.
d3742f3a-ce06-4069-b8bd-b23b917b2ce8|Your readings will show energy, but no substance.
84edc3d7-d87e-4033-a625-18149421d2b9|There's no substance in what you say.
098faa5e-70b4-494b-88aa-d503c5bd02e9|It's also the substance that killed your husband.
417b9057-c2f9-4278-b578-62d25f933b64|Give me a total on that.
34524779-f03d-4e18-b89e-f32aac88a788|Here's the total that came in on collection plates.
5c7424f2-7882-4c65-a33f-8e15052c6960|You get two minutes each, four minutes total.
0481eb36-6ec9-4e64-b144-c34bd220819e|Less than seven hours total is not much time.
dcf98490-b7bb-40f9-b5a2-58c174c02d9e|Tom's total stands at eight acts.
864ec290-776f-42c6-85be-d4d18911a5b9|That's how strongly I felt about my mother.
709f7157-7f6c-45ac-8a21-2997129debd4|We strongly suspect he's on board the boat.
484a124b-9e58-4f58-8b97-40d55281e87f|They're outside because they smell so strongly.
b728c86b-c7cf-47fd-9b62-c73b9acbeb62|The blood on the passenger door strongly suggested it.
65516d14-a038-4139-8720-ad8b69ce3501|You've lost every battle, this will be no exception.
3822cd4e-9107-4c3a-a88b-d55673b718c7|You're the exception here, Sally, not her.
d0ed5df7-356a-41b2-a34d-16cde90904f5|We need to figure out why she's the exception.
c6aef5e0-c179-43a5-99d5-355c5747f0c8|I'm sure you'll make an exception.
f353e748-ce0f-4a69-b3e6-229569c89ccc|Let me go give this to the night commander.
c8b00815-d9cb-4330-88ea-a01c046454c9|How many samples do we need, commander?
1daa19b9-a5a6-4790-9570-e9daf4b0179f|Don't go spending that all at once, boy.
ed2c5184-012c-46c1-ae0e-befcfe6afcdf|Then you really recommend this spending the day together?
5658a44d-5269-4654-90c3-05b40badfbac|I'm working on spending time with my family.
db8ed5bf-d961-4bdb-a078-08e767a01bd6|I don't know that crucial thing.
0d3ab023-3b9e-49d1-9ae9-41c11204798b|Sir, these first hours are the most crucial.
8a13dc75-3f1a-4d29-8c65-eeaac428dbfb|It played a crucial part in his murder.
6160e5d9-bce1-4460-8402-350821ea0821|It's about half an acre of land.
d2679021-a31e-466f-ad80-6e7a9567e0f4|We do have literally acres of room.
b2be6bbf-d887-4a63-b379-87c6a17222d4|I can wire anything directly into anything.
b38d6e1a-20ad-45d5-b8c0-46edd1ce8283|Maybe the machine got its wires crossed.
63239296-7193-4c36-96d4-1e8d8eb4e47a|I need you to wire me some money.
15728571-81f7-4b32-be72-a89734db28a7|I think we should do the wire.
46dee6e5-bb3a-47e6-ab9f-42a7be0f74ed|There's been a change in command.
8b28e81c-94fa-4909-90d0-7c5dd6b38413|I'm here to be at your command.
0fd4a238-f4f4-48d3-a41e-1e4c73de6130|That was a command decision, protecting the greater good.
178d0ead-12c2-4fa9-b74d-fda6eca7645a|You're my second in command.
992e3d8d-01ed-4eb8-82b3-46614206b8d1|As you command, my lord.
5cbe13da-4ce7-436c-83ff-98f051367099|What do you have to be nervous about?
02ec4751-4836-4248-965b-a66b009970cc|You don't have to be nervous.
c4e75c3d-31eb-429f-98c6-b6d875c4461e|That's what's making me really nervous.
64b4b05a-7ad7-46ee-8440-05a57b41d286|But I was so nervous.
acef1c27-42a6-436b-991e-87c8df4f73a4|You mustn't be cross with me.
6da073d9-c1f0-47ab-8ad2-1ef8c8a37277|Yeah, then hung up on crosses.
5505e61c-6ed6-4d8e-9443-8f3e7e1eeb88|Well, there were a lot of Asian girls there.
bf30bc9b-b5a1-4f77-a24a-6c9559d783df|On as in hot Asian group sex on.
784a0f05-a2c2-404f-9467-72aa2cb56628|I see Nelson got the cell towers down.
71c211da-f94f-4d77-a551-722b998fcd59|I can explain the cell tower.
82e7dc71-4ae1-4176-a973-275e51523b52|We passed a radio tower on the way here.
95bab717-4d2b-4568-9542-989292b23ace|I hear a lot of veterans have that problem.
32d6c739-3397-46b5-8ac1-b8ec0843556f|I'll go first, then Annie, since she's the veteran.
0cb553c3-7b98-4da7-8de9-e007d9202cbd|You're dealing with a veteran of two foreign wars.
3cbc40a4-9540-481e-81f5-c5206c9616ca|I didn't know you were a veteran.
2d6acce6-820e-4b09-8992-0e661dd9f86d|Pay some veterans to fix the places up.
bb4dd9a0-40cd-4e8d-b8e7-1d7c298684ca|Aren't small creatures supposed to be fast?
561004c9-4222-47ed-8c30-75a75a7e5703|What, ain't that the creature there on the roof?
385ff760-1c05-467b-9b53-a1c285433b99|I do have a history with the creature.
6067b553-f02a-4940-9732-49b8a3fa9b9b|The creature was in your room.
db06cf01-0700-49cb-a329-93370a4e0f4e|Okay, that will work for a smoke screen.
105f7767-323e-4a97-b473-c74bf018a734|She wasn't smoking, we were.
a2cf9b61-6025-416e-ae34-1f4146a730e3|It felt like it was smoking me.
83de35dc-38ce-41d3-a29e-fe196500b7be|People must have been smoking.
3141385a-038d-4d0f-a4b0-4842d3093ed7|Sir, there's no smoking in here.
3ccd4671-0e74-49bf-bfd6-a231a64754bc|One Jewish and one Arab.
fa692dc7-2941-41d7-82f7-c01c2b8203b9|No, no, not all terrorists are Arab.
5673a5b1-be9b-40d0-87ac-aa08cc98902e|British and Arab interests are one and the same.
981f4333-6f73-4f95-a7e3-114051f6ad43|The prince would never see me.
a4f035ab-bf9d-43cf-8918-c9a7fdaa51ba|But tell me, the prince, what was he like?
41c4f0af-2525-4393-904e-12a48b134c4f|How can we form an alliance with Victor?
00e1d81e-7f0a-4a97-b246-9a9923da54ad|You could've just called that an alliance too, right?
55765478-bdb2-4e90-9a80-394ac0eff802|And in return for our alliance?
6ad02a0f-bdca-4732-8d3d-6839f3c2ef3e|He seeks to create a new military alliance.
292979b2-e278-4164-86d7-32ba9ac15fc1|You will not make any stops.
9fe38326-37ea-45b6-b651-80cba19e4d20|Well, that's a good stopping point.
c124cdeb-a292-4a53-819a-98bd1d3ef1f8|There's no stopping what I've started here.
034fb3e1-0a5a-4430-a052-5dd3484fd4e8|Good luck finding your friend.
97be8ce9-6559-40ad-92e1-e542a894d1c2|You might have better luck winning her back.
84a8e3bf-fa4b-4304-9200-286cf460c248|But no, Jackie, that's quite bad luck.
40de05d9-9c9d-470e-9996-a7af31252827|That was where our luck ran out.
5c221800-c123-4ec9-a6d5-d58567e28992|But he didn't present with symptoms.
f9bb592f-2c61-410c-a55d-15b533d4ed18|Which doesn't matter before symptoms.
a4908846-ac77-4173-adf6-a11686c75e52|We found two new symptoms.
afc4eb17-5b17-4eac-ade9-e97f328c70f6|You said nothing that would explain these symptoms.
8c35c510-7d05-4039-abbb-bd4d08b5d32c|I've actually been doing some research on your symptoms.
0122e078-f9d2-45c4-b03b-d6fe84bb16eb|He said we had to bury it.
b287c72c-e5c2-41a2-9964-49d17185dce9|She wanted to be buried in her own clothes.
374b7cf4-bf01-4cb2-80de-70cbeaedba89|I'd as soon be buried alive.
3a9b1afd-1b63-454b-b04f-7ea526be911d|I'm burying my husband tomorrow.
85ec6406-6920-49d0-be02-18e108c72eeb|I definitely don't want to be buried, thank you.
3e3036d0-5ba6-4d5b-9a9b-0fd222d3f78f|She wants me to take her to a clinic.
68659668-5523-403a-be62-5c807c07dfd5|Mary, we're not a nursing home, or a clinic.
a4fc286e-551d-4977-9ce3-39d24ee165b9|There is no sign of any illness here.
dbe50365-252e-4fc6-8a14-f02dfbc2d2d8|Talk about your mom's illness first.
24623d71-aab2-4681-8923-4eb87e3f5921|They say it wasn't a sudden illness at all.
3a5f04e5-ae7e-462a-9737-8b35b51e66b8|And he doesn't have the illness.
8d4c2f9f-829a-4743-949b-3fca75bbd300|I heard about your illness.
338614bb-7024-4a57-9d9e-e87fab105746|When we first met, you were my prisoner.
518b784e-b476-4841-9bc5-b25c134a8371|Why am I being kept prisoner like this?
77ebb4cf-d1e7-4454-860f-9add0f5fdba2|You know that prisoner he was helping escape?
1fccc337-bb74-4f67-bfc6-b16c41bee98e|Make no mistake, you are still a prisoner.
ba59c1b9-fd3e-4b40-bd5e-41e5915c0f45|I do not want to hold you prisoner.
51d45f83-e157-44f7-adf5-c4a2f37c0462|See you in our next edition.
c5797d5e-fdf2-4002-893c-cf542b1e2037|It was in the first edition.
919e4428-801d-418d-a0a1-f59dd0f88ab9|Call it in for the afternoon edition.
61a7d2c5-cc10-4a82-b279-aad4e2badba9|That was removed from the second edition.
0e141078-e9c4-46fb-bddb-ad916ffb6faa|Get your election edition now!
7f1de0d9-7390-48a4-9c15-3e3b4936f009|He ain't got the juice to do that.
f4c2cb17-8c8b-4f50-8b6d-aaabd1059f4e|Yeah, let's kill the lights, give it more juice.
68a069e6-5bd5-4158-a590-f62146d1cfeb|Let me get that juice for you.
3ba38d28-82ae-40a9-a3b8-03391ffd60ed|Would you like fruit juice?
25f7eb89-3ff9-4f8b-b92f-b17ee504b9e4|Can I have that hot sauce?
41efbfd7-b2ce-487f-80cd-0e45719ffd61|And that was without the hot sauce.
d8918132-7415-4dfd-acfb-25e139e47aad|Know how this sauce got its name?
e090858a-4264-482d-b13d-6679920b3c02|Come on, your getting wing sauce all over it.
f96821fe-fe88-4b19-ac3c-16c4f057970f|I don't think we really need two sauces.
1eff3535-0af5-483a-815d-9ea24da2f66f|Do you want me to give you a peak?
d24bf1bf-697d-4dd2-84cd-7e1ac20a6b14|Maybe just one quick peak.
89f517bc-bf5a-448a-8e80-61caf0f4a99a|Now you're at the peak of your life.
718f4eba-d092-4b98-9db9-38342382f4a0|Well, I did miss my breakfast this morning.
a10ad48c-0027-4205-9f76-bc72a88d1d60|No, but I made you breakfast!
97e7cb31-c6b5-481a-bfcb-6fc15184a50d|Man: Last call for breakfast.
c379ab4c-0603-45a2-b3b5-92d2147198a6|Today, you're not going to eat your breakfast here.
10e0790e-7f12-4fcf-926c-e1aff3fba0f8|Do I smell like it?
9f0f45a5-724d-45d2-a79c-9074c39d167f|You'll smell him soon enough.
11514962-7abf-4700-9b7e-3c2e0792f8eb|If they were alive, I'd smell it.
4a324734-e363-442a-9cb4-9530c7e9924e|I can smell something else, can't I?
d2363e1b-db92-4a78-9717-c380040101ee|You didn't smell his clothes?
128c9e8e-9c2b-40e0-baf9-14dc065301ad|I'm glad to have an ally in the room.
fc95ab03-46f7-4a1d-a84c-e2118bf9c18e|And a powerful ally it is.
a33204b0-d3b3-4803-af16-5607d20d831b|It's about picking your allies.
b43de700-988e-4ad3-8386-a4fde4fc44c4|So pure I can't keep up with him.
fa659494-7e46-485f-b876-259b482915dd|Well, Jimmy, the girls here are young and pure.
a91d9b29-5d15-4a51-982e-1ebf212784d8|Well received with pure heart!
5b5793ae-f577-4a73-8d9e-331eefb3b898|Every day, you pretend to be pure and innocent.
5fea8151-e70d-47fd-8a3b-8a6cc670479c|And as for your little toy here.
4dd2d647-221e-4052-939c-39be9101941a|Let's see if our toys are still there.
3b88e374-f38c-4295-b438-a18f7c361c9b|You do prefer these toys to human life.
b479c73e-c8e6-4c3d-9ec5-24e36f2b4940|But a better salary is also important.
41bc4989-4703-4e7b-b210-68c670f8a99d|They don't have to worry about salary caps.
cee87cf5-4571-49a5-9c44-75c666775e96|What are you doing here today in the bathroom?
c37a527e-ea20-455e-a4e6-bde3de643276|She's locked herself in the bathroom.
57681926-7fe7-45cb-91a6-c44e6687f6a1|I am going bathroom not home.
681a8701-6fb2-46c3-8e32-3d073e041d64|Then why did you leave the bathroom window open?
49b0ecc6-80e9-4578-a4a9-0c1c44bfdc2a|You know I can't use a work bathroom.
db48c14e-c422-4484-b2c1-b804dd5f9a81|It was a conflict of interest, surely?
168d2d6c-d4ed-45f9-a213-4b7310d69760|Surely it will be student honor again.
b0a74273-15ba-4220-a544-bd655d5d1af7|But you must have some somewhere, surely.
b9381424-9197-4d98-b5c0-ba24960cd029|Surely our criminal justice system can account for that.
1770a48a-347d-4d7c-9aef-7c3d9e62102a|You have enough to share, surely.
5995a7e1-a1bf-47ee-b146-5e379130edb2|Though I'm sure I cannot imagine its full dimensions.
cc9135f8-21cd-407f-bef7-84239f776e3e|These guys are fighting in another dimension right now!
d3ce87e7-53da-43d8-a694-863df3c038e5|It keeps them from achieving their true dimension.
2a06c6ca-f80f-4ac4-a093-bea1d4f33197|In front of my house, blocking my view.
8ec1faf9-9429-4546-bfbe-4b60722e708b|I would like you to block a number.
c6c4ff82-2cfa-40bd-9ff9-4d719819a16d|I blocked all this stuff out for a reason!
1a655b95-bc8c-4b46-ab97-85aef45574ac|You're going to race home, aren't you?
6c4ba345-e35b-4223-be4c-effa1a866678|Racing's all I've ever known.
85f7a676-c050-4812-bac9-6e4899f2634f|I don't want to race any more.
96cd85ae-b910-45a7-b0b3-949d9af67c89|All this stuff is racing through me.
ab4735f8-a3b6-41ee-8e76-ef8f3f5fc8a0|What did the personnel office say?
fa96cf3b-6e25-4130-8260-b0d61f1e7dcf|So, shall we start going over the personnel reports?
7e9fd689-d267-4c0a-8bc9-b98caf0e9c00|Do you guys have any personnel files?
11e835c8-464e-460f-889d-2ec3c481c126|Name the stars in his belt.
3d181425-cc1e-4aca-a92e-f3037c124ff2|You don't have a belt, do you?
4a25461e-475a-4943-bd14-fa669647f819|Do you think this belt is too much, though?
bb2c3a1d-8bfc-419e-9b2d-aee4e96e194e|Was wondering if you wanted to accompany me.
4046ccf7-23dd-4207-9397-16d5de424e2c|Would you like me to accompany you?
5d50a1dd-815a-4ab3-83cf-920d3595b2ed|I'll accompany you until then!
0624dbd0-d403-4a63-90e2-73de8d0cfa74|Not releasing anything until my album is complete.
70a4b00e-f5bc-41cf-8309-72c50dd35a4c|She's about to release a new album.
acd5470b-5932-4cc0-83ed-9da813e99dcb|This was your first album to go gold.
ac474bb4-caf6-4b1c-8002-bac4d4664864|Take your time with your album.
5dfaa1bb-4bf2-4995-8958-08b74fad8aab|I mean, perfectly legal work, for the most part.
b9896275-2cbc-416e-ad0b-2b266eb705ad|And as you can see, it fits perfectly.
4b23a4c4-cfad-4ae7-9f0b-33d9191757c4|I think it's perfectly clear what it means.
8c81fa38-4a2f-44fb-bb43-8a56a65a73e2|I feel perfectly safe here.
38b35c18-6b79-4483-8717-f9e618b4a79e|Perfectly so, I thank you.
26964c3c-30f7-4039-b302-3be3555b7dd0|Why does that strike me as important?
1ea9effb-abc6-46c1-a4bd-90b153e2cfcf|'Cause I'm certain he's gonna strike again.
0af202f2-b5aa-4dd5-8d31-3105256e0aa2|Because you know what happens on strike two.
82578836-90bf-4fc3-be2c-52fddfda0e39|On his private jet which he flies himself?
2b258b96-00ee-4906-8dfc-8103da0f1455|You've never been on a private jet before?
a49c8d2a-4ca9-4989-84f9-be7f4a72c89c|Should have held out for a private jet.
94eec13b-650e-4922-8c8e-d1d1e57da008|He sees me, jets out the back.
9dc7b3d3-8d16-4126-a88f-79c8cdaf6d0f|Hello, Pete, have you five minutes for me?
41ffafab-d920-414c-b5ca-96111d70ad8a|Why don't you go over and say hello?
78d06796-706a-4e21-8f27-83f9596093fe|Outside, having a smoke where you might say hello.
8d4e09ad-e617-4e6a-93ee-8493687304bf|Think of how this is shaping up.
0a6ba284-30b6-4544-a98c-c3120e98578f|Things are shaping up in my house.
d5801419-c259-4934-bde8-8c78c5561e30|How are the men shaping up?
6049ded8-c43f-4a9e-8014-07b0057c61ec|Kids need to be shaped into something, right?
16b49b36-81a9-424d-a1db-c9e1f3a2b06a|Otherwise, you are very good at shooting my relatives.
fe5bf525-ca2d-4d09-8af4-fc5d495bc169|Do you have relatives that run the place?
9ab142f3-f58c-45a0-852a-6f531d8413e7|We're trying to help people find relatives.
8cedfefa-98a0-40ac-99f8-5f0df4708f16|She stops tourists by asking them for money.
2539e96f-6c02-45a3-8426-cbbcfef16118|This foreign tourist speaks well!
ca7eaffe-e83c-4f4b-b6d2-02fa8346d85d|Of course, without another player you're only a tourist.
7e05433a-3c6a-4c25-9740-4955ef6a5681|There's a tourist bus coming into the shot.
91491f6b-f0b4-4483-94fb-1c165be59b75|Let's give this phenomenon a name.
e5a67b7c-5533-4de1-a530-1f1f6cc6271b|It means that they're not a natural phenomenon.
9e1dfb4e-f4ca-403b-b8a2-2c63a1a29a7a|I can't help that I'm a global phenomenon.
ebf3fab7-a4d1-4aac-b772-396fcaa93a2c|They will say that I am a phenomenon.
f6578de5-9c56-459c-8dbd-176245fd8977|It's just nice to talk to a fellow human.
e9b41fc7-9e6c-4aa9-9861-77fcfd181b29|You always pull guns on fellow agents?
4fcc5503-79c7-4cb7-8738-53e3fd3b7c10|Let's meet your fellow pilots, shall we?
df0b4e67-5ad9-470d-a1cc-f346b1f93874|You're facing a murder charge on a fellow officer.
72175434-dd15-4073-b9e6-3145aad7c2cf|With any luck, he tossed it in the water.
30162747-267a-461f-a74a-d5f90be35afa|They tossed it into the back of a truck.
df94ad6b-9f58-4a9b-87fe-44267cfa9cbc|My mother, who you just tossed away!
9d3c7332-ff77-4a0e-be81-f574aa4b8884|The place doesn't look tossed to me, though.
ee0ffe80-c1cd-4bd1-82e8-e6ed90fb2b7e|I've already tossed one on the way here.
ef8d20be-5eb2-400f-8d1a-4b973538c350|I was at a nearby district office.
a6cda39a-539a-49e7-af0b-4989a43afe2d|If you call from nearby, I'll come out immediately.
bca39ca7-503e-4d3b-842d-4140f51b9784|It was probably dropped in a nearby collection box.
a6e8a029-da4b-4f98-b4cc-6a366f68c6da|I entered holy orders late in life.
7fa45b8e-16ee-4586-9005-ce5aafb51542|Can't you see my holy habit ?
d5887d17-9afb-4c6a-9a4f-565e4bbdfddd|With all due respect, that church is holy ground.
d4ac9a01-3f9d-4dc9-9289-4bda460d97d6|You got it all wrong, holy man.
490553d2-f816-4999-aa33-0a7070d39ed2|Your dishes will be seen to, in due course.
549676b5-bbe2-44c1-8d30-3c8649743f3f|With all due respect, that's not why I'm here.
5ec537ef-c5b7-4e8f-9b71-45b024c3bc45|I figured I was due one more.
a08f2282-0443-4227-8b0f-0a5a3fcadc41|An inner circle, if you will.
6385b09f-9509-4f10-b908-793346864bea|You have found your inner justice.
4f536846-c3db-40ff-8bb9-83a1e5077ac3|Think of it as inner dialogue.
02c31a9a-1c04-4e5a-a45d-1b24d71f07cc|That was my inner child being scared.
7b983bf5-a203-47d7-a1c3-23d67c0cfae7|I suggest you get more watch your son.
af5f10de-783d-4098-b0c2-d67d9223f3cd|It's the only place they don't watch me.
3cdeafe3-cd1b-4895-9b39-251c28c01201|Are you sure you can change his watch?
99e5e2a2-c7b2-4cbb-a1ec-fe0535aea7e5|That was really hard to watch.
77ccba96-756e-4d27-b15c-c0c166355f7c|Not indians from India, indians from, you know, here.
2d8bbaf6-55c4-4f1d-b44e-7ed46b900b4c|That she didn't marry an indian.
35632c59-dffc-45ae-9294-d333c253c6a4|I thought you meant Indians.
c9daaf72-eba3-4eb0-b6c4-7bc7efc7bdb0|If you're not an indian, you're a white guy.
2ab0810e-aaf2-4b4a-930a-8ed2465b56cd|That's the trouble with most indians.
5c40c103-e628-4e8b-817a-8d2bc94db1d1|I pray that you are right.
9e45cac4-eb8d-412f-b82b-5251e03b0d6b|Every day I pray nothing happens to him.
6417bdaf-3ad5-4536-9685-d7a6dc266b2f|Been praying for him, you know?
9efff863-0f7e-4dd4-92eb-5b5dfaf5ce24|Let's just pray we're not too late.
9001dd6d-7ead-4ffb-98a4-211cc1443317|I already prayed, and we can't both win.
5782470b-778a-45b3-9c96-bf315eb6f32f|I will go get some from the creek.
2e9474b9-9c24-407f-b68a-09b6d56cef9b|I kicked it into the creek.
64737b68-fc5c-45b1-b12f-ecca292787a6|I used to watch you swimming in the creek.
25566eb1-9316-4644-8ddd-50c776cebd74|There's a creek running right through the claim.
1c04c9b4-87ac-4eeb-8e71-4edba3a945d1|No who ever denied it supplied it.
82b80a24-760a-4deb-9182-62b164f4f349|They ate what the water supplied.
6d7fbace-2de9-4fa0-8e06-8d535b2a0402|It supplies drinking water for all of Boston.
fc0cc040-e8d3-4741-aa12-a26f98206759|All right, we got a boot print right here.
a10e4737-9ffe-406d-8fd0-284380bdb737|You have two sets of boots, India?
4049102e-3c0d-43df-85f9-76a3807b8451|Do you leave on your boots on while sleeping?
967a2c45-86af-4c4f-9869-9df7a2f52284|This is worse than getting the boot.
5639d341-3f0e-4e29-810b-81907762c254|I whispered to him so no one can hear.
d9d343b9-e9ed-4dc0-8a21-f863451424be|People will whisper, they'll make their jokes.
8119b269-e56f-44e8-b918-c486e6c9d030|We're not whispering secrets up here.
582b9797-aaa0-469c-b596-d27c49f75a09|Why don't you whisper it to me.
e8856a8e-fbd7-41f1-9471-7c9c1d4a7552|I resisted, and the next day, I was fired.
6e82e23c-f92d-41b0-aa76-1e9bb27a4cf5|There are people who resist a long time.
4ea1d43d-6825-4f95-b219-70db666c2644|Your journey details, times, all paid up.
3e18a379-8479-46fd-a168-7610d0a81866|It's time, and so I must begin my journey.
e40e18d5-a7a9-45ed-8280-61e965ac3370|We've been on quite a journey together, haven't we?
878232a0-62d4-40ba-98e8-bf845df2bece|It's been a long journey for us.
5a21427e-baf9-4bc0-9d56-d76155228d7d|I am looking for the flag.
8bdcfcf2-6960-4637-9c7e-a5ba513c1d6b|You don't win until you get my flag.
c8e20b28-f672-48af-ad23-2b9996ec183e|Okay, black flag, black keys.
56342ae9-884b-4545-8323-06cd6051dc21|Being too kind is a disorder.
fc128100-7b2d-4a65-9096-50b56ff48718|Stephen, why is the house in such disorder?
48c5f289-9347-409d-bd69-5840d2af0f91|I've got an inner ear disorder.
7b5add24-46d3-4f0c-abe3-bc51d059d7c2|It's a genetic disorder that causes.
a655e477-eb57-4e4d-93f1-b2c28062f7db|I can't afford designer things like you.
0ef38504-26ca-4bf7-8d6d-ccc4488d4a08|I want to be a fashion designer.
d7cd8ece-9d16-4aad-870f-2f6494a2dd06|Having sex with women while they're wearing designer shoes?
c3c90c06-bfff-498b-bd20-d249a37c7784|I admit, they put me under the table, literally.
68c4818a-39b0-487f-80d1-b86004a00a7e|The water's literally pouring out of it.
fefd2639-dc9f-4b1b-943a-f2f279d52387|Literally lets us know what we are feeling.
ed78539f-bbd2-472b-8d2c-310232b8c938|I am literally the boss of you!
ea23905a-38a7-4cd3-91d2-34dbb0d265ab|I'm on this case for no apparent reason.
24b7decd-d40c-41c0-b53b-b5da72fd4cff|There's no apparent connection between any of these victims.
2aba6593-0282-4d84-9385-0e4867e2f353|That much is becoming apparent.
a2a05e9d-02f8-4c0e-80e6-063252a5fa42|A new variation suddenly occurs for no apparent reason.
3a181118-128e-4f6e-914c-2ce84a68b8da|There's no apparent damage to the bone.
b3805681-3095-4cb0-a50a-421dd3ba6df7|I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.
5388116c-25bf-491f-9db7-aa05521c3f70|What a wonderful, permanent commitment to make.
ec3ea9ff-69c9-4aed-b4f0-fee04c2ec7a8|That doesn't have to be a permanent state.
ed75eca4-3532-49b9-adb5-0887de334e8d|Let's go at this from a different angle.
d26f60b8-a67e-442e-ac08-9336bbbffc3c|No, it has to be a high angle.
9ad2479e-ecc7-4fb1-8239-7de2fdcc331f|That's the angle I want you to tell me.
e4a52bf9-37ac-4369-a406-5c5230b9ceb0|I already broke my record for smooth.
3b1794ff-1d18-4bbf-b344-d83f22b944ce|Or hold her smooth hair in our hands.
90db8683-82a4-49be-9764-8461fc1d6857|All good things are both rough and smooth.
e79589b6-e4e5-40c4-82ef-365c7d1d9080|It is not always so smooth, believe me.
7b6dc069-fa79-441e-91bc-9926c3c6f12d|Yes, unlike your father Arthur.
4424527b-1867-4ebe-819c-56c2d8152065|Unlike most everyone else in my unit.
301682d9-6fd6-4b92-b485-eabac8f6efd1|Unlike a trial, there is no defense.
1022aff8-baad-46de-aa32-284e10c08088|It will be unlike any love you had before.
f97f3835-2dba-44e6-aa7b-f3731757f6e7|How do you like getting smoked?
5d421df4-a458-4f7b-b039-2cfd229c5564|Should've smoked this before, you might've relaxed a little.
4ebb5c4d-90ba-455e-8478-bad9ec7cf06b|On the other hand, I don't smoke.
4d6d7c0d-74d5-48d2-a16a-60ec7617219e|You do not like when I smoke?
d8c87170-8114-47ee-8823-73ce900cd14e|If I had, I'd smoke it myself.
c80613af-9597-4006-8696-7d1340ecab3c|We both are twins, just not with each other.
149fe73a-1c93-4309-8dad-ed562907ce5e|You have a room with twins.
cbbeaa84-593b-49f2-863e-2717614c3269|But I don't think you'd favor the idea.
a9f211ab-696b-4011-93f9-1979505ec63e|Does your favor involve killing me?
d248c48c-3097-49db-9ec2-ba65755f6fa5|I hold with those who favor fire.
cddb182f-0c5c-4466-a7ae-b119721f926a|Are we favor friends now?
57488ced-8d50-430f-91dc-8bbff05a00cc|I think I have a bone in my throat.
9c48e6aa-6945-46fc-baf4-73f03acd6a69|Or I'll cut your throat!
ac4a7ca5-a73b-4078-a655-a8f0432a1587|No wonder we're at each other's throats.
f6bb30a5-c572-49b5-a047-969a11d989cb|Today is the writer's birthday party.
45fa09d0-8d32-4e15-9f15-cc96f6914b0a|John's first birthday is not a big deal?
c2f714cf-3d3f-4c2a-a1dd-9fdaf78afd5a|It's my husband's birthday next week.
fc7f3319-8891-4b33-8e94-955a0a3ed490|I want to find the real birthday of Johnny's.
9942ee5b-cb56-4fb0-a157-73e01d97d59b|We used to go there for children's birthday parties.
9d5ca46c-1f53-4683-8eda-e5b9c6179ca9|Oh, you won't be swinging it at me.
23f1b382-29d2-4c08-befb-32e66b4f7c2d|I mean, how did you swing that?
84e725b3-2723-458f-88b1-6681dbfdd2aa|At least it shows he has no true supporters.
3808cf1b-6e88-40f3-8e68-bb307b6301d3|My largest supporter is definitely my mother.
a19b4436-13c0-43cd-beba-61cc5e34d629|My gay fans have always been my biggest supporters.
e5362416-ff70-4d25-beef-81a85eb21dc1|Well, that sounds perfectly reasonable.
c7cfb11d-fc7d-4347-88fe-db6717a75f02|I mean, why can't the judge be reasonable?
e27cf994-a97f-49dc-93ee-450005114af3|Why don't you be reasonable?
ba071d2d-9a10-477e-901a-072c79b541d1|I'm just glad you check your voice mail.
e2fbc251-db90-491f-bcc2-ac807dad791a|It'll be sent by mail tomorrow.
cf702794-1e5b-41eb-88d4-3c0aa1021d5c|Has there been any mail for me?
171ec0be-1444-4c89-aee6-5ee2378cc2ec|There, it went to voice mail.
2fa24586-f5aa-4e44-b311-10bacbe55b74|Yeah, he could use a little silver lining.
a3ad4d6f-8a6d-4a68-8c89-541f4696f151|They're all true, except for the silver bullet part.
ca9acf00-4e5d-45d7-a70a-d46123d73493|It is like a great silver sea.
ac5c48ac-a839-4e40-9b3e-d7f79ece7d3e|Okay, take it easy, sensitive Julian.
05dc45de-273b-4dcd-b036-e2dd9f655aa3|I told him not to make it so sensitive.
7287bff3-bf29-44fe-b30e-4017d2b9c9c8|You call that being sensitive ?
4fedbcb5-e313-4707-befa-3a9cd50c0242|There's no navy waiting for us, at least.
9bad9af6-d524-488e-a8c3-9f7963e26c9f|The navy's getting stuck in to them.

c7a3de20-fe20-4f82-9c79-eddfb8c20855|You know the penalty for defending terrorism?

dc56b921-cf61-40d5-9a82-bc64de303a81|They're calling it an act of terrorism.
ec1f52a8-5dcf-4ad3-a088-17f90379e3d5|No, I glanced at it.
4d83a2c5-e90b-441f-a079-532109b173f7|I was glancing over your files.
b8376635-941b-41bd-af96-9de25098e0f2|I glanced down at my arm.
b9ce90f7-f7d5-4761-bbca-09f5ea6af451|She glances back at you.
85ab2bbd-5d03-4638-beeb-e231dd825c45|So, what I want is a good observer.
65eb3046-a118-40f5-9c6f-d79d9da804ee|Keep in mind that you'll be observers only.
dd834b5c-b3b3-49c2-93e8-e3cba48d2917|Well, he's bound to be up here somewhere.
d033b272-0381-4d38-8fce-b0040c9ef830|You're bound to get out sooner or later, right?
06d063ad-b4b6-42eb-bea1-1a2a68d44cbf|We are bound to the old families.

c923f0a3-8e05-4f20-b5d8-ff8317649729|Some wine even smells like wet dog.
a4feb244-9b85-4d36-8f4e-dcc33ef36414|Leaving wet spots on the floor.
6826da33-0cc2-43e5-8e17-7dc9e12a070d|I gotta get out of these wet clothes first.
4503946d-a70b-4f08-990d-3938d91da04b|I don't like cold, wet things.
2a831a45-84d6-4555-8529-9974a67accd2|Why is your hair wet?
d0f0c3e4-e933-45bb-afe6-c6ae802ee4b1|Well, we've all lined up, haven't we, girls?

adad78d7-6bfe-4355-a415-c61e6840e88d|He told me he was quitting therapy.
49129a31-c1de-4865-9047-5f275257606d|That's why I had to quit.

f0f440cd-9d03-4651-bf1d-b4811beb0bfb|Why can't I get a straight answer?
71e333ff-2f6e-42ce-bb90-49aa807b71af|I don't know, Brian, it looks straight to me.
fa2e2f50-4a0e-4b0b-996b-0113669a0be2|Well, I need some straight talk now.
bc53ca6a-00c1-4124-856b-7d46c43524b1|We're on our way to assist.
b3a9b952-fcb9-4538-b304-91bc2dda3cb8|I'm here to assist you in any way.
a5e5d6e8-1f95-4f6c-a83c-dc7d97aedf88|And even assist him when needed.
d9e5ce08-8e23-49fe-bddf-d55fb8027d6c|Should we hold you down as assisting?
4cac0068-ffac-419c-bc50-82d842d24f1a|What such a suggestion does to one.
6799e7a7-550f-43c3-b4c5-c6be74b331a7|No virus known to man could spread so rapidly.
f63dd749-04e7-4cd0-90e0-216081ec8a93|Could explain why his symptoms appeared so rapidly.
4361f481-d693-42de-a20e-f8d9be87bf65|Can't you give me a rough estimate?
1baf54ca-51d7-4566-a729-cee7a8dbd6c2|Six months, my brother estimates.
bbbc3cb2-0019-4827-9b8a-baeac4d19a8b|A matter of days, by our estimates.
7d0ffa86-d9a5-42c9-87fe-160e14605a38|Could've at least let me give an estimate.
a0f7130d-cb23-4720-9e06-90ef0bee6ede|Remember that when you're embracing your new family.
af2c99bd-1713-43ba-8f2c-6b4f78e88e6f|I am embracing a return to business as usual.
512deee1-1397-4f09-8e1c-375302edf87e|I've been making them since junior high.
c3ecb706-5ae8-4a9b-a53c-ae07b9d72536|You didn't do the right thing, junior.
ffb372ab-8fa9-49a5-82ac-5d3fbfd90be0|On winning your first case as junior partner.
355245d6-b025-489c-b2d1-7ecc511dfe7c|Nick was kicked out of here too, junior year.
bf7c3c24-f4c8-4de3-ad5c-a77ef57b2c16|Add some mass to my stomach!
d2b807eb-c020-4745-88af-7338adf4dc5c|Your stomach turns every time you look at me?
02c8b819-b1b8-4a4b-93e1-3ecab584b622|I've been drinking on an empty stomach.
3dfe990f-3023-4c68-b852-2e68b240822f|It's an extreme case that would never happen.
f4ea3170-6bb2-4dfb-9312-71a23bc87f60|It's always different, not always so extreme.
5ef8bd21-b9b4-4205-a7f0-cd090b05b7d7|This is pretty extreme, man.
50855416-4f5a-4bfd-ac42-c0f45f306124|She is totally his pretty woman.
ec78c87a-24e0-406b-aa27-13af2c432aa6|I'm in some pretty good luck today.
ebce3859-07c2-46bb-b8ea-26a4bab266d5|Looks like they've had some pretty hot dates.
3d2386e8-e35c-4aaf-a2a1-403e8f79e79e|You got a lot of pretty things.
50a8c4b1-2bb2-4ad0-a8b6-5ff5c757a986|And I don't want you to hold mine.
9a0b7f7b-c6bc-415c-93f8-8199fddfd9f9|I'm the best man, he's a friend of mine.
c58cb90d-2677-42ea-bf1a-cff3422a9625|I'm keeping them with mine until she comes back.
c136f588-4c29-4d92-9a4c-757412ad6496|Today is your day, not mine.
856aff1a-11b0-4071-9c2e-1163d766c173|Said the reason you dropped out was your recovery.
2716bc32-597d-4cf6-a6b0-7a06889a43d1|You know, it's part of these recovery rules.
bc9d9eb6-ec38-4ec6-843e-abb2f8f7ec9f|Our recovery team only found one of their bodies.
192a38b1-fb46-41c0-977f-19d33dfae2fc|We're part of a search and recovery team.
e776b23e-74ba-4f2c-aa81-a5b5c466c575|When we first met, I had a different impression.
d5b9f830-f57d-46ff-b700-1da7cd11cbfd|You always make a good first impression.
c2546e7b-f8dc-4f3c-a670-50e332b403ef|You do seem to be under that impression.
a289894c-fc7c-4eb2-a3da-3d4b114fa63a|We're just looking for impressions.
e001868a-5eae-40bc-b3e2-2f1767db2981|You made quite an impression on him.
ef7040d1-15b9-4e00-80cc-6b94f4c22919|Did he say he was cutting his wages?
d521fc41-ddce-4d25-b634-af0338097aaa|Or I'll wage a war against everyone you love.
f27bef58-3810-4213-a5b8-0b868917d82b|Here, this must have cost you six months' wages!
85be8073-c655-41dd-811a-446b7f401671|Can't manage for long on my wages.
3bec9063-0044-4c43-8dd4-5ba1047007d8|I believe I'm having my fifth heart attack.
01e2105f-aafa-41cb-b99b-77a3f89bb285|You were married to the fifth one.
5700d660-7a87-4007-b861-e9f708ad1481|I live on the fifth floor.
bee7025a-722c-45f1-b08e-fc9e325c8b84|That's like the fifth circle of hell.
e5a2671d-95c1-44dc-8365-1f9113d6d76b|Maybe you should try the fifth floor.
11a4c727-cee4-4941-bfa1-9f493ef0b919|In time, everyone accepted this false truth.
e2115ddd-d9ed-4d91-b266-748d08040d6e|Don't give him false hope.
17074465-cbe1-4f90-95d1-982abda9f8a4|Checked in under a false name.
8ccb9910-1536-4fba-9bdc-451ed64e97ed|I am gonna count to one.
417f0ef8-6c0f-4c34-adb9-565f36db2ea6|Look, I'm gonna count to three.
84c8b502-6232-4538-b6f1-32b9077e8df7|But I suppose it's the thought that counts.
3bd12993-be51-4209-8263-6d8f7ecfff54|Before she can add to her body count.
5eff7441-f9b3-4867-8bea-86342dc87631|I'm gonna turn the radio to Pink.
90263de1-c1b5-403b-a1d3-7a1e3e4afa2a|Pink ones and gray ones.
f8cfd589-0842-4442-a233-bbb09200844e|She has pink eye too.
14f4978e-5ec0-4df7-8391-9bff73f5fef9|Tell her you're taking leave of absence.
816c5681-136d-49c5-9dad-900549af7e44|No one seems to notice my absence.
b5ae49f8-eaa3-4001-b101-6e107c0a79f2|What with the complete absence of dogs and fields.
6998c60a-d061-477c-afed-d92191705818|Their problems make them aggressive.
37c244a1-f971-43bf-ab10-a99948dabd34|You have to be, you know, more aggressive.
f2bbc1f1-9166-4e5e-9ef1-fcbebcb42d67|When you're a cop, being aggressive is not enough.
2ad7a478-e239-4e7b-b7a9-d46dc43b2b9b|In other words, an aggressive approach seemed most effective?
aa1170ec-e18d-48e5-b7f9-1140cd98918f|My suggestion is that we get aggressive.
fada0320-9aa9-4549-bf34-3d0b0fe87604|And you know how much I love corn.
8a2558ab-987f-44ca-aec1-cd09a3496bca|You guys are guests in my corn.
4cda4334-7a3c-498f-bbc9-20225d38d6ef|And get some of those blue corn chips.
0027fc03-e1ec-4c69-b217-438daeacadf8|The point is it's an odd mixture.
26ae3806-e985-4911-a686-92edf5e3d49c|It's a mixture of hard work and great fun.
616588f8-7922-4902-9d86-48fa68d920fd|Well, it would explain the mixture of equipment.
ec5b15df-5d7b-421f-ae12-3bcd02541f1a|Yes, did she die quietly, in her sleep?
58fc3fda-8537-4b67-83bc-e47260859c96|We eat dinner quietly and listen to the record.
ba5a5b82-1501-4bc4-b7a3-2964c6617307|My days dragged quietly by nothing was new.
db609d88-d1e2-4bce-9477-2442ca5f35db|Quietly, carefully, slip out of this room.
1dd5eb22-9985-4559-8f3c-e51c9b2a6806|He can never just slip in quietly.
c2037c70-da78-4b7f-a187-650ce09ce9f7|Help me put my dad in jail?
217bec9e-0add-4ab4-b211-14a225c0b9f7|But it still would mean jail time.
989f3404-7a6e-4107-9541-9cae8cd80f42|You know what happens when Cops in jail?
ad8ea093-691a-4e07-b5ba-96ec7729d45b|Everyone in the specialist team who examined her.

8448e0ae-5f33-4eb8-8369-974248a02aa2|I guess it's dealer's choice!
75e4c720-ec87-4fc7-86b2-9eb50fa9357a|Do I look like a drug dealer?
66f76f3c-b736-4a18-9c99-2ca75ebcaf35|Every night before bed, I read a poem.

e9e0e8b6-b73f-4e1b-923d-7b661b21621f|We're gonna weigh it out.
d8a445a6-8580-4714-b568-d170d9488acd|I'm just weighing all of our options.
e6f882e0-7440-4a18-b52c-177272a2459a|I don't think you weigh anything.
d027526d-0314-4afd-8767-395dc221ff2d|I mean you wanna weigh in on this?
16e485c4-de8e-45b3-aaef-6232d096c480|Looks like it weighs about a half ton.
64641023-299c-44e1-ac7b-ca1decd7a713|Would anyone else like to comment?
3bccc06b-6776-49aa-b282-f091b2f7c0e0|Would you like to comment on that?
dc17d3c3-973e-4c22-9673-2a6d8bab90f3|It's just worth commenting on.
aee0d46e-8785-4031-b784-804f632785dd|You know I can't comment in advance of today.
1c30ad6b-5fda-43d1-a9ca-2770147b08f9|You can ask, but I won't comment.
96e5e1b9-3c77-4602-8aa0-4dd3b0e542df|I caught my wife eating from the pan.
719d91e5-94f9-4e2c-8173-9be1b94ddd3c|See that pan over there?
4d93d123-75ad-4bbc-b585-892b091703f9|One pot and one pan.
4ed1ac19-5705-409d-bfe1-668432037a6c|He would have no pan of it.
044132a7-4d7c-448d-9606-7fe6076ae0e6|And change my bed pan?
8c01444c-313e-46c7-8afc-8fd7291d218b|I assure you, these are not necessary.
3113a2d5-ac38-4cf4-b805-8471dc2e366f|Spain assures that I will make it back.
e4f52217-a24a-4e2d-9248-a5e6ad2d3346|But rest assured, we are doing our very best.
17455b30-5b56-4137-b1a9-b429cb36aef7|I assure you of that, young lady.
673441fe-0344-4735-a985-46b9a1832280|You're not missing much, I assure you.
3e1255aa-c84a-4247-a0fb-3ef55e83549f|I want to remind the viewers that we're live.
390840ac-84af-4208-8185-f0e9966bf61b|You're a big hit with the viewers.
15b447bc-7892-4ab3-a0fe-f164cb083ff9|Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.
3f85d654-06bd-424d-9a53-07ac2067228b|It's up to a viewer to figure it out.
50d69805-fdcb-49e6-b792-f499069aa15e|Your enemies arise from your mind.
e47260e7-0a51-462e-98ca-99e6e8f681ca|We finally must arise, the young and the old.
2e8b31ce-f55d-427d-90e9-6c2b1442d9c5|It didn't arise, it wasn't necessary.
a94fbaad-6043-41e3-8e64-d73fc4feecf2|Course I guess maybe some little problems could arise.
df66a219-45d0-45c4-9680-b930d9dd4a3e|All right, devices are being planted.
277c236d-434b-49ed-9789-bc5820b4d4e8|You saying it was planted?
43bd8128-08fb-4cbd-867b-3ffd46c1e24a|We planted out there because we needed to.
f72b2cd7-5d7e-4488-95a9-17cf41c8a78b|They planted it in your mind.
9187a948-f89f-4b50-acd3-5b91c877ad39|Someone planted the drugs in your car.
17673a99-e3a5-4b8b-a5fe-432c00c99cf4|To be perfectly honest, I've heard some talk.
f275c7ca-2f49-4dc4-b491-8b1ba13d3250|I shouldn't have been honest with her.
30f763ea-8ea2-44ea-a7b1-0e556f915471|To be honest, I still haven't paid.
a1514dcd-6357-4db9-8f06-01c9567b9c42|Just come on, be honest with me now, right.
9938debc-9120-43e4-b8db-f9e476c65404|Do you want me to be honest or nice?
23e03b9e-87b1-499f-acbc-65bb96140429|I'm still working on its origin.
0a300e0c-cc80-40f1-a166-68fdd52f23f0|It doesn't appear to be human in origin.
8fbc4864-0c84-4afc-8073-024c3bd74bb7|We got to find the origin of this house.
609fc4d0-4bc0-431f-a842-1630aa0096dd|He could hold onto a giant bird.
52ce36a4-5451-4834-b4dc-071dbc72a7ad|Probably not death by giant boot.
93b819df-6069-4b67-9b48-64862c14b2ed|Well, look what the giant cat dragged in.
1f619056-2e6d-46eb-bd2f-623de5ed7c2f|We take down that giant today.
ff66b20e-d1e5-44e5-872e-e82f18bf7734|I didn't know she did diversity hires.
bc8fbfce-da58-47fe-a3ec-be56e2a41307|Species diversity is greatest in the rain forests.
421d4066-f7ca-40ec-bd13-801e3c736072|And Owen knew about the diversity of life.
dd2713f4-fad2-4cbb-9aee-7745144d4ab1|You think I don't take diversity seriously?
2f94a6d0-af3d-406a-b3f5-d525891799b6|I can see you went with diversity in hiring.
5ba83560-8bc4-4362-91cb-d96fb465b1dc|She always uses tomatoes from her garden.
127ba5cf-6dbe-4fdf-bf0a-6a8e92ba7fff|Be careful, you're walking over the tomato.
17e56ff7-64d0-447b-885f-bf938be6f577|I don't even like tomatoes.
40d6375e-f17c-46ef-8182-b04d7b6bbbd0|And I know that I like tomato.
6aa12e5e-c1f1-463c-8d6e-e32e62fb4c93|For some reason, I'm imagining tomato.
869d141c-6df3-4959-bae3-67ac7687751b|We would advise against it.
a2a553a1-ecbc-4544-999c-0b7ff43c5610|Responding units be advised I am now on foot.
ab804fbd-6e98-4c8e-a118-8d872c9e068a|You wouldn't be advised, would you?
1df69ae3-7e11-4c3d-98ab-54ea17638229|We're facing bigger numbers than we were advised!
5a5972e6-c086-4d8f-85e1-f9103f167885|Well, I'd advise you to call your lawyer, Tim.
cbf48d5f-2774-434a-84af-f4de3a2af4d4|Well, it was a shell of a good hit.
97b28d10-e084-46b9-986a-d25aed7ff71a|Must have been a bad shell.
b9a7db2d-3073-4d41-8b34-3dacea34cde6|The thing is it's listed as a shell company.
4ed5c133-043b-4510-87df-989b6da0675f|There's no shell in there, you know?
307c39f1-4dba-4472-a67e-4fe66a44fff7|I have that piece of shell hidden.
94d44d13-684b-450f-9e11-3cd2ec51354b|Now, I'd like you to write an essay.
126823a1-4b63-451e-b952-0abc40f72117|I've got an essay due Friday.
b70d1f95-ce55-4146-bf29-dd19a8aab3f0|Now back to those creative essays.
9c3cf686-41d1-423f-afa4-7998bbc801a6|You better get that essay done.
9cc461fb-50e8-4571-a2d2-e7892a6338d3|What is the subject of your essay?
7d00f202-a59b-486b-bacd-2b1d8ecccae6|Look, I'm telling you, Donna, I'm on a roll.
926b355b-a4f9-4ec4-ae99-dcccff5a565d|I mean, she's already on a roll.
bcf00856-1fe6-44c5-8c94-0034e339b0e7|Half the kids on honor roll are taking it.
bbc1876c-4993-4143-ad46-2f9d7e911f8e|Using my skills as a historian!
46d097e0-c66f-4bb0-a7df-032f1301bb65|Are you, like, a local historian?
08469b1c-82ac-48ca-b41b-85b587375436|But would you have made a better deputy?
bc0683ab-9529-4d82-9de0-26dd1de09f52|How's things with your deputy?
f6b6d9bb-ff1b-4fd8-b9d5-efcbed74180b|I can't exactly call a deputy here.
aa113659-feaa-496f-8dce-9a3ac84f3ce6|I'll send a deputy around for it this afternoon.
71202d23-4bd2-4839-8e15-7d43409758ed|Could be someone that he started dating.
d8fe0f02-439c-465c-ad01-5847292514fa|And then you guys dated, right?
9da8cdb9-b14f-4320-9b9f-09e9426e8f2c|You're dating someone you think will get to me.
273f0ad6-464c-498b-b735-135721be1148|It almost feels like we're dating again.
3f6354aa-0067-4c26-aff8-8708509b835c|Dating, we're just here as friends, I know.
fc282791-20b9-4832-906f-1ac7a5405512|You have to tell the truth effectively.
e1ed6430-ab01-4410-b84f-c01e38260576|They'll kill as effectively as any living thing.
0d30d576-0ec1-46aa-bf48-f78df6fcfa03|But effectively, I've only met him twice.
789c826b-7d7d-4089-ad74-70b3542646ff|Maybe we jumped back in too fast.
2afe0e41-b904-476c-ae8f-ff52af0bbd57|The faster you guys can do this, the better.
c7fa1df3-1354-4b3e-bab6-28cb9acef623|Yeah, that's a fast ball right there.
4bf54b65-3879-4bce-9db7-8bee07d5e092|I think you pulled a fast one.
5de8f1dd-e344-49d6-802c-aa6c6f4a4cdc|Hope we didn't throw you off schedule.
4686b3f7-30ba-4ac2-8cad-6dc68e7f1a60|I'm gonna schedule an extra long session tonight.
2ada8666-03a9-4fba-b8fc-893ca5900b29|They've scheduled a meeting for tonight.
85a28e21-73af-4666-8ba7-ec08ae6cfda6|We didn't have a meeting scheduled today, did we?
d86bfa36-2504-4cb4-a45a-6c9bce3ec339|And what wouldn't you do for a buck?
9865ccbc-5bf9-4010-a924-403798fd8011|So, sell a million records, that's a million bucks.
0c097547-b045-4748-b2d3-68938d7259d3|I'm just going to take five bucks.
540ef6ad-4a48-4c5f-bcff-35245d7f66ae|I mean, seriously, his job paid a million bucks.
aeb4f6ea-6dc0-4455-b7cf-f16295d78d3d|That tube top that you were wearing.
e1cac1bd-5823-4e99-aa7a-8d98cfb049e2|Those tubes must contain the fuel.
3e96673d-c07c-4c01-a11f-b10170b5e84e|This place is going straight down the tubes.
7f18cf41-7fb7-4cda-88ea-e9146c3ca6b5|Which means they have about four tubes left.
8a2e75aa-46e6-4aad-ab99-91838563add6|No doctor in town will serve the refugees.
a4dfc858-7e04-4e8a-b71c-5aeed7040d4c|The president wants to separate rules for political refugees.
a914f357-d4ce-4649-b1e8-561683a3911b|Her dad ran a school for refugees in Africa.
7ad0c49f-0d99-4cf8-829c-9f58019a9e59|Not too much out of his depth, is he?
7d43d351-7b7b-4f5d-af7f-df199971b758|I'm really out of my depth on this one.
6bf36cf7-a35d-4be7-ad8b-af126df9f887|He said you were using the flat.
060cf950-6e60-4329-88fb-6e3f323639d8|You haven't been to your flat, we have witnesses.
0985e431-4a25-4276-a735-6fa508272fdd|Too early in the day to be that flat.
2c9cdc36-9fa5-4f9e-8271-b839d8957335|Tell me that's not precisely where you're going!
76da6c59-254f-4e8e-bab5-ccae6fe87a39|See, this is precisely why I need your help.
3c8f2832-87c3-4670-bb20-1088ece40b6c|That is precisely what I've been trying to say.
4fbbc765-f0b7-42b2-b42b-f85cb5d4cb0f|Which is precisely why you shouldn't quit.
24a80cc7-3fec-4346-8435-5edf5c4f53b4|That's precisely what I saw.
22598b4e-9c66-4b01-8018-04d5c321cac2|'Cause you kind of seem mad at me.
292d0106-71fd-4f9e-8b56-d3d578ae856e|I was mad when I sent you out here.
66c11a09-c8f0-426a-ad7d-6ca8bc663405|You were mad because I abandoned your dream.
5178396f-50ef-46a8-a37b-a47606291b92|Your mother is mad about you.
3cdfb6ba-2b0a-41f7-a330-8a47b127eefa|I just thought you'd be mad.
26d32509-cb35-4af1-87c7-705db040f018|I feel like I'm dreaming with my eyes open.
d41bbd28-4018-4751-9bae-58dbbe58f784|How can you know whether or not you're dreaming?
5ceae695-f9c5-4507-98ca-3c1cb9c67224|Except dreams that won't come true.
3cf1cd4c-bac3-452b-b4e7-0f8aedadafc0|And when I say drop it, you drop it.
4e5decec-8226-4b8b-abc0-80f42cbbcef8|No, no, no, every last drop.
9c9b8008-c0a2-48d9-a772-963d2a74dfb0|I made assumptions about you that were wrong.
c75bbfcb-19a4-4691-9d8c-bd0f69e5071e|Oh, well, that's quite an assumption.
ec53307f-25ca-4572-8a3a-2b44456351f0|Classic white person making white person assumptions.
46668fce-7df3-45e3-8978-0133506ffd63|Only another violent man could make that assumption.
408cded1-2d6a-4343-ac83-278da276eab1|Normally I do, but now everything's changed.
16b2b404-be6c-43ad-a0dc-046962112c3d|You don't even normally handle cases like this.
9ed31d7d-f4b1-4305-9899-81bf2ff19841|Look, we don't normally do this.
b2c96bae-b531-4559-ae10-d0caee338461|Well, what do you use normally?
a4aa8bcb-d84d-4ca8-8421-e069bd8c3ce9|Mikey, Jerry you guys like angel cake?
d7ab8eec-bb22-4197-927f-4c9fbe6dc419|Yes, my angels, we are on our way.
8f907931-0700-4b67-8646-8aa3ea67558a|Did she look like an angel to you?
7770a20d-1608-445b-b187-f07612bd75cd|Well, the other angels won't let you.
8e3ac5e6-26ea-4b6f-8872-a856e61082a1|They always have a way of popping up.
3a6842a7-adfc-4276-959c-3ebe328f9940|My sister popped out five babies in four years.
0c26eeb9-c92d-41df-9765-6faaa79d96b3|It's like the family just popped up one day.
4b4fc2f2-8726-4cfc-880c-c36095d0f93d|But evidence in civil trials can meet different criteria.
a0af067e-5822-4ae7-a67a-f97a9bef8f87|Well, I've got my own criteria actually.
cd13aba6-b29b-4904-ae73-a19926d70579|Why, what are your criteria?
ef591ce1-a7d4-468c-ba27-84a11f290617|What about your minor, dance?
84cd2c33-73a0-4335-9996-da7bad3af960|But we've only sent minor stuff.
b885ac7d-79bc-4cab-b674-aaf22a767ead|Is it big or minor?
48d2f4a0-4e38-46c4-b3ac-d0c97717ec6c|You have another crop of supporters.
beaf4126-9549-44a0-8f67-8c54cd49e423|I'll go check out the crop circles.
35866d49-6b07-4473-8fa3-b20eb24f0d49|You've been assigned to our work detail.
0343f8da-8367-4439-a9e9-2211cfa9f5f3|We get assigned to whatever needs doing.
e5ea1ab8-e523-4405-9623-adeb4d4d074c|They assign a special person just to you.
b421bb46-b871-40f6-8968-7b7c316df26a|Oh my, are you an elementary school student?
09d9aabb-3142-432b-bce1-ecc528658d87|Clearly, this is the home of elementary school children.
762b6b96-e1d1-4daa-bbb3-ba35c19c7270|Look what they're handing out at elementary schools.
65f9b7c7-cc2c-43c7-b1ca-3343d12d5e9d|This is your class photo from elementary school.
bf87d16d-9846-4003-8273-3492fb9d402a|This will be the most valuable thing we have.
5089b60b-b8aa-4483-b9d4-9a82a4b2e3ba|Those two better be as valuable as you think.
a50ea6fd-2746-4b37-8131-3ddee40b9b9a|What do you got so valuable you got protect?
d53dfde3-89e9-412c-8613-0548da64685a|You're more valuable alive and on the ground.
2145b5b7-9b5f-4314-9a62-71511b7473d5|And much more than her life is at stake.
fb640e91-45a4-4b73-a108-81c51bba85b8|I'm just telling you the stakes are higher now.
d55904e8-8654-4779-8acb-84abad26c8d3|We both know what's at stake here.
a35cef5d-c91a-4efb-a895-aeaabb9dcb82|A man's life is at stake.
0785ae90-20cd-423d-b83b-24185c554868|Did you get those concert tickets yet?
29f66a8d-085c-4ee1-acd9-0e3cb4165de3|To you, this is just a concert.
b0f75623-fee5-4820-af02-9a4b492bc657|I still got these tickets for the concert.
4b61cb88-6ea6-42e6-ae3d-e9bb1a6c7586|But I'm not just gonna label him without talking.
320b19d4-cee5-4127-9210-b3ed1694d5a0|This label has launched so many careers.
4c9fc6dc-748d-48c0-ae13-2e5f318c06b5|I do not believe in labels.
82a03b20-9c07-421d-b616-3034028a411d|It tells you where the label was created.
a5d6840e-996f-4d3d-bc89-565d22ae7c21|And I've already gotten offers from record labels.
4110b94b-8d5e-4fd2-9525-0e15d85aacd3|You call that a dance routine?
0b1e8ee1-27e4-4866-b2c2-d7b721ea4d7d|We started doing better routines than they were.
e083720f-a32d-4b0d-b283-dea7cc636698|How quickly we fall into old routines.
3879a77a-c5dd-490b-960a-be7bdb07d2e0|India has many men with too much wealth.
1c3cfae7-baae-4226-a9fc-ebb171e93ded|Yeah, his entire identity was based on wealth.
9f955500-fb32-4c68-83dc-1b9547ce494c|We find wealth, and we take it.
22c8ee9e-fa14-4ed5-bb9c-09453af3a0f9|It comes with no wealth, no land.
fe8dee97-fddb-4c35-8d71-7d8fa9f72d6d|You'll account for the wealth you stole from me.
dc938968-48ba-480b-a861-fc1114fde610|Why would a gang leader ask for my help?
c8992ff8-1648-49f6-8b31-64160bd98834|Why would a street gang want to kill Matthew?
5b61acc8-20a8-4e14-b2c0-c098dcea2671|What gang are we dealing with here?
03b7f0aa-b50b-4bf2-a09c-c6562bf1f783|Don't you mean former gang members?
e764cc53-c742-41f2-b589-f94353c904bc|Also, there's a problem in the area with gangs.
cc613f92-1114-46e0-ae9a-dc6ee9ce5cbc|You never did say how you got that brand.
193d35b0-0894-443d-9a8f-5e5ad6e17b04|Yeah, you know, just thought I'd brand the day.
1a5de6fa-7a73-4910-84a6-f66761b657eb|I tell you, some top brand gear.
4a22f79f-02a0-4980-90f9-7aedadc25034|Who paid you to brand her?
ceea1f78-ad92-4393-910d-09268a8aa956|It's brand new, this one.
936593e7-33ba-4cd9-92bd-ff810483c92d|I don't have the recipe, but here.
ddb0c557-22e0-41d6-9b2d-3a1aef35f183|That doesn't sound like much of a recipe.
4e38b9d7-a95e-4118-bc0d-798db520b17e|I don't care if it's your mom's recipe.
9b07747d-8413-4d1b-8479-4446cad06c46|I've been working on a recipe for years.
09aa98b6-b4f3-4b9e-b3f3-a861ec60d882|Your wife just died, and you're talking about recipes?
5ee81853-83e2-4ae9-a877-1a43579211c6|You wanna be on vacation, Pete?
cc021709-e0d3-446f-bd6f-84da03b25245|Mom, are we still going on vacation?
e60be583-be7c-4200-ad1c-7153d86d96b1|Utilities, cable, stuff like that.
7732291d-6c8a-4138-abaa-de90f5253f5d|No more paying for utilities.
33da23cb-be65-44c6-bf12-394e93e555e7|No car, banking records, utilities?
2ef08d03-a2f9-4534-a092-22fc68bb06da|No phone or utility lines coming in.
5d3bd4f5-67b3-418d-abee-9ead8bbdeaab|All you need is a satellite connection.
e355b733-9645-4614-8035-71ceaeb01eb6|It's a satellite phone, so it works everywhere.
360f8c4d-a94e-4d9e-9966-d25da61e9d2c|A satellite phone, a map, clothes, food and water.
0be382ea-14b9-4c79-838f-21c4f426cc65|Why are you waving me off?
3f9a67a4-142a-459a-a040-3c9cfa863acd|Stop waving that thing in my face.
86842e1d-15da-4d58-a95a-e4d42e60066b|Stop waving that in my face.
8ca994b3-ad51-4e43-9213-6b7f101cb650|So now she's waving to the crowd.
e30c899f-3c70-4c56-8da2-a4585221aefe|Look, tonight we're going to this ultimate fighting thing.
29e482d9-1b0b-4f92-bfd5-47927305ca3e|You might even just pay the ultimate price.
0f1399ce-c706-4623-8f6c-f8dcf6690948|Their wives do like their illegal chemicals.
a286de55-a20e-4d04-8a1b-631874590103|Your clothes have chemicals on them.
a42b5cf8-e3a2-42b8-b715-98acd4467b41|Who has access to the chemical stores?
cf8e0536-986a-4f85-bbd9-c83ad398059b|Also, I'm a gay rights advocate.
9c90e78f-fd08-45c0-be2b-198de621e69d|We'll need a lawyer too, and an adult advocate.
69b36d6c-976a-410e-bbc4-0e538a0e08f2|Why do I need a legal youth advocate here?
a567479d-ac9c-4d1b-ac57-73e100f5e163|She is and has been your advocate.
4ac77572-1cec-4410-833c-058965208f47|That would drive me crazy wondering who they are.
b82014c9-81a4-4acb-a987-af1ed486379a|No wonder it hasn't changed.
412ad143-ea98-495a-8760-08c24196b5bf|Then no wonder you didn't feel well.
12435513-0be8-4530-b046-0dfb72c59f5e|No wonder you don't like yourself.
6a061f27-7f95-46c2-9b4e-97376bf962eb|We didn't come here to eat cake.
8198eae2-cd6a-4599-90c1-f1df8d3a9c53|I guess you got the cake.
0c405f88-a1f5-4b45-9160-a12eb4b9a16b|No cake for you, little girl, big mouth.
d7f33e6f-d29b-488e-bd3c-df6567e357ad|And how did I eat my cake.
cd8eaba2-6c69-46b5-960c-a9234bc79b19|Have a cake, I made them.
f820b60a-af75-40ac-89cd-14964e4978f3|The simplest phrase can have a thousand meanings.
a8def2bb-4192-4f4e-9de5-3598ff7f4506|The most common phrase in this place?
40bb5efe-c7f6-46e6-8b2e-ed8f25481ef6|That's as good a phrase as any.
dc6b033b-38cc-4af0-9fd3-3b0c00e6528c|She wants to make me yell.
fa912a7d-d315-436b-b5fb-a72e579860aa|So why are we yelling?
4bd7b91b-164c-4884-b5e5-de982bd3c8ca|Stop yelling at me in front of her.
c217c721-b677-42c6-b497-cfa73e494bf7|She's, you know, yelling about a stupid movie.
fcbe6510-29c5-4b28-a569-464d0b926baf|I personally do not want anything from you.
777cf10c-1e20-48e2-a231-8f1dbc93983e|I didn't really ever start, personally.
ae43d4a5-bc7a-4720-b67e-f431fa3349a4|I will personally take you apart.
25a5abba-c617-4d69-8d25-36719adfc669|Personally, I'd prefer it fit like a suit.
631f721c-c4c6-4b4a-9f55-6f139d662c6c|I'm a classic example of an only child.
09a9b2fb-5496-42ea-b0ba-d2434d79d62c|It is a classic, a very popular choice!
4169125b-7632-42a8-8039-4012176cbea9|That's kind of a classic American thing.
50b7123d-3db6-4b8c-9767-28749ae2d47b|Look, Nancy drew, this is a classic suicide.
6a64c29b-f443-4722-8487-40c19d47bb5d|Then, a doctor snapped us to attention.
3a95799d-1ae6-40ff-a4a0-dcbc1ab83b74|His neck snapped as he hit the ground.
2e5a328c-4a01-46e9-a94e-b87452f6fa30|And get him out of here, via his desk.
569b5372-8c28-4417-b8d7-caa69d02e3f1|We've written to him via the royal care society.
280e06c3-9a24-4fce-a00a-5c8a83223114|Say, via insurance or something like that?
47dc0b61-02f1-4b55-a220-882f0836371b|My mom won a lawsuit a few years back.
fc552c57-dc80-4071-b85b-9e203946c30c|Are you prepared to deal with a lawsuit?
7a4aaf0b-0bed-4086-8d62-2e44dfbaba24|You did this just to end the lawsuit.
23b0a0b3-9e47-48c3-8952-94a95f0aec7c|I know about your lawsuit.
8c74e331-c86e-487a-9129-783f9da8c72e|You installed a hidden safe in his office.
9f94887e-15b3-484c-8f06-0ea1617fd387|I'm sorry, but I have to install your chip.
662c8223-c2f0-42e1-8180-599fa9999a0b|It's flat and you can install anything here.
f1bdbc27-cd45-4239-bafa-c2c39586fa94|I'll let you install it.
dfc13de9-f3f9-4840-8b00-66cf0188d226|He's the guy who sweeps my beach.
da622730-b285-441a-8d1a-3b80debf2d00|I should sweep a little, though.
9b93d992-62c5-4211-bb57-18b4950877bd|And who has to sweep it up?
7a0442be-a157-4ee6-ad38-0fce1b39760e|This is a music and arts festival.
9508fd96-00a5-4451-ad38-2bb16dc3da37|When it come out of you, it's a festival.
080a7578-8ad6-4a26-b1a6-65f4a0571ed9|I do so love the festival.
5789acb5-0bfc-475c-800c-66538ee46de4|You got this at a street festival?
7664ac8b-53d0-4986-9ab4-72557d0aa6f1|It could let in a draft?
d8f0c170-b4cb-47c8-83af-0c1b6cbf6c40|Did the draft get off, do you know?
383d483a-c88e-4095-aaeb-ce832b36b136|You guys wanted him during the draft, gene.
d3938cbf-1d3b-48f5-9b96-ffdb555da0d0|This actually, though, might be an older draft.
b8ee551d-34df-4494-8d70-918e4938b028|The draft board told him that.
b0c4be0f-1a1e-475a-955c-c6f4e1124716|Will he go to heaven then?
4628dc67-d704-4c42-a0da-3060b13d581f|All good girls go to heaven.
513f5e00-ffea-456c-8902-b7ac3b3560e5|In heaven's name, what does all the row mean?
b2a55d5c-17d8-44be-a0b9-7282abb730f7|Marriages are made in heaven.
40ee5fc9-72af-4709-8c8e-e85242949197|He must have been switching them out.
d71e58dd-e076-41b3-9129-433c7e7f499b|You guys switched and didn't tell anybody?
cc492ce5-d3e3-4cdd-aa8e-f1eb2aea7c51|I thought I'd switch off your light.
fdb80b21-5a12-44bd-aa85-110c2f14c925|She didn't have to switch schools when we moved.
c8fb0cf0-678f-4777-96b8-b1b969c636ce|No, it'll switch itself off!
478a8682-8b97-4abb-a748-c91e1f737ea4|We were no longer student activists fighting for justice.
2b466f10-bf5d-431f-9022-246f43c4df38|He was an animal rights activist?
2b809ddf-e9b6-477c-b50c-4cb346e39ba2|Her parents were political activists.
60a1ab4d-0973-48fe-b950-d75f2c38beda|Activists have to plan ahead, you know?
3f8c370c-3329-4fce-8945-39b55fb0c506|If you don't go, the ceiling will fall in.
f8bf3b43-b265-4920-976f-cde11f4bc2c1|I'm gonna let the ceiling thing go.
97ff150f-ea44-41bb-a5f3-513aed648d84|You said that they did so around the clock.
ac0e471a-c2fe-4328-8b14-d0cd6a4e19eb|You can see the clock, can't you?
c3b39bb4-1541-4796-a018-02a35d7dcee8|It seems your aunt is here.
2b76ae9b-b418-45ac-b8e0-466a68cf4d03|I was staying with my aunt in London.
0a1b2e4d-8cd3-48c4-9302-1d9085d644e8|When are you going to see your aunt?
d98fd861-2067-4e4b-9ff4-fa460af03775|Your aunt had one of those.
9fde2bdd-f6e8-4c64-b8d9-669e7cb62c65|We won't call her aunt Sarah.
561635c9-6489-4af8-975a-2e61227c9374|At least we'll have the cover of darkness.
94b0e21c-70d7-487e-8109-8cd44ecde1b1|I saw a darkness in the girl.
a9dec315-b538-4f9f-a0f9-96119e6a1b34|Since long before the darkness fell.
1a1b0fd2-fc61-4660-b3ba-d5708c0c36db|Mickey called your daddy, asked if he sent you.
c08eafae-a553-460b-bdc9-d923331c6306|Our daddy is a friend of your daddy's.
328c6d7d-0397-4bbd-a0de-3c3fc83914a1|I'm just tired of playing who's your daddy.
7d4312d7-9feb-44d8-9bb1-926cbb1f43f8|Are you questioning a royal order?
eca35dfb-2446-4774-8707-4bb157bad2c4|The royal family doesn't even know they're missing.
f44703bd-43af-4264-a659-4614751e5c45|You're trained as a lawyer and in royal service.
6de113e6-ddf3-4791-a261-f09f314231d5|That speech was a little rough, don't you think?
ad8f05e2-3980-459c-9eba-ea6197a4d7bc|To be honest, he looks pretty rough.
0ed7f109-c706-46f8-9483-061f3e94034c|So why was it rough this morning then?
b3b3f531-bea2-47c1-b326-fdced0cf4137|I had a rough start in life.
d4489be0-d1c5-43c3-93a9-e973eb97c70c|What he's told me is she wasn't pregnant.
d19bd161-ff0b-4f8e-b8e0-bdc37d795efb|They must have done it when I was pregnant.
0b3bdd08-9a28-46e7-a7b4-be25cab98875|Pregnant women aren't supposed to drink.
97f228af-f6e9-4155-b93f-4e8183013a81|I really wish you'd told me you were pregnant.
eba8852e-48f5-481f-b91f-b9e687cab15c|What are my chances of actually getting pregnant?
dc4ea8c3-b138-46db-8afa-d63636c434be|Have you come up with me penalty?
db3c625f-fcf8-4c6c-9c14-0db024dff4a4|If you are guilty, the penalty will be death.
79ffb01b-2a81-4b0f-bdf0-56abf959af80|And that he got the death penalty?
49f3c083-9b32-49aa-81e1-4ce8e01f4a34|But with a severe time penalty.
993d519d-4663-448a-945f-ce73c515cec0|That should be worse than a penalty.
9851f8fc-fe84-499a-bb1e-9f732fd55ba3|At least some very distant relatives.
bc95925a-4d00-4e42-bfdf-bff000ffdb82|My actual mother was very cold and distant.
66c394ef-2c1b-4939-a1d2-fd62bfb1f849|He just seems strange and kind of distant.
45a766c9-d8a1-4096-80b2-43371ddc0297|I've already examined those pictures, and they yielded nothing.
5a94a162-6840-45ee-ae98-e7e081ec58a5|Well, this is clearly yielding nothing.
b742a9c5-e698-4e58-ab42-b728113580bd|Without that, the people will not yield to me.
79425d4e-a495-42a2-99f3-fa9ad8ab93b5|You didn't yield and neither did we.
e421b422-0c47-4779-b099-9fe427b95cba|That thing won't never yield.
1b875898-adfa-4daa-824c-edf3290622f3|I have a wound in my left shoulder.
65dc3ec3-0d2a-4e53-8ee1-817971356ecc|But sir, you were quite winded.
3c409030-4c3e-4ef0-9960-8bbb148fa887|I'd wind up in jail.
9532db18-5621-4c7b-b1d9-6780a4bc0782|That mystery bullet wound I got when I disappeared?
38122fba-ad2e-431a-a6e2-251ca33a64b1|No, I thought I'd just wind you up.
3f44faad-68cd-4815-8d83-0bdcce58876b|Then why is the lab under armed guard?
c25d54b7-0c40-4d33-a884-810f4fea67e4|What, so are we armed, then, sir?
a05287bf-dae5-4700-900c-01d3b737c763|You're not going anywhere without an armed detail.
5d96d03b-2ba8-4dcb-81f7-e70fb4862c1a|It's some sort of religious camp, but they're armed.
6e03cb71-aefb-446a-aa92-e67a62d40c53|These guys are gonna be armed to the teeth.
0c928be3-16c8-45e7-9783-5bf691c13333|Those that join us are well armed.
5f7d7470-e31e-4509-b1e1-4b2676dec78b|Is that what the human body is, a mechanism?
4b17c68d-cd53-4e36-b08d-e00e4a0e2eff|It's a defense mechanism, all right?
3f850aa6-91aa-47d6-a92f-c2e3838d1bbf|The arming mechanism must be somewhere in here.
d9c90a35-c236-407c-bfe7-f78fbcf82e75|They came up in the ranks together.
74eba860-6166-4591-9d6a-0e9b8faa7c20|You pulling rank on me?
872ba07c-44c7-49a0-848f-cf1888714005|He embraced the cause and rose through the ranks.
6a5624b2-5668-46aa-8fc3-16d95561a146|I'm just saying, the girl's a killer.
45ee5735-34d8-4215-b11a-415f1cbb558f|You're not a killer, and I know that.
dd1d94fc-c776-4264-8045-1094ae37c175|Find out why the killer's doing this.
a4b6c50a-9c4e-4a7b-b17d-e463b1f814a9|I'm supposed to make the case without the fence.
7b597278-a446-4c03-81c0-c19326083207|I jumped the fence and came in.
e36ca01c-eb3b-4b58-9da4-9706437c29c5|You can't stay on the fence no longer.
a5c4fc11-f28f-4190-9e70-50faed671b9f|It was a strange way of universal love.
1ae16d64-b6bf-42b3-8ac3-dc2f0f817f13|That last one may not be universal.
639c5e58-6567-4dce-8f99-4c0b285ee7d5|Are you trying to build your universal machine?
daec321a-7c1d-4f7b-b5a5-e4b751ebbc28|You rule these people by terror.
376aab3b-d0d0-4fd5-a14f-35cba92b383c|Why, 'cause he's having some night terrors?
58218333-dfec-4397-8048-2472754862a1|We can't afford to look soft on terror.
5bc67178-1ac8-4ce6-852d-550ff19d773c|Strength of the wolf is in the pack.
b6175c57-afc9-4850-bfed-8f8229cd8902|You I'd throw to the wolves, if I could.
2cb43495-4c4d-45d9-8730-82e4cbd4b459|What is it with you and those wolves, anyway?
74444578-93e4-4882-b0f9-61cc5d869a79|Why should we trust a wolf?
230ae215-35de-484a-ba07-7c4de5455321|I love that you're making my house our house.
179a3939-a4fc-41be-a714-3a0ff8ed817e|We cannot house them all.
30139be7-9aed-4ed9-a7e1-6cb3cf2d561b|Any trouble sleeping or anxiety?
c7bb0955-a4c4-432f-8f1f-a0bebc3eced8|Laura has had an anxiety attack.
dcaf726b-3e16-4d85-8694-c823481b1b1d|About seeing someone to help you with the anxiety.
ccbce390-1572-4597-91d8-09967dd53a38|He was suffering from anxiety.
7a52039d-1d39-433b-9831-30b2a60102a9|I'm betting they had a little chemical help.
cd42f4f8-7a07-40fc-a3a3-c5a8060ab726|I imagine they have chemical help.
d1529f4e-f8ad-4d6b-a9f5-71941e4ef9d0|It's probably just a chemical reaction.
2596501b-eab0-4675-89d5-7f0793f938d4|There is no question that your anger is founded.
421d5e83-f994-4f9a-9a79-ade9374811a8|Which he founded using money from my mother's trust.
da2518d9-631e-4b7a-b794-26b2581e7eda|How do you think this country was founded?
6536b0be-3e9d-4d3e-a29c-a38d944db743|That protein order has to last into next month.
ce7b0cd6-c7ea-4cc2-a566-e163b9bc2812|He makes sure I eat protein.
41cb8c16-1ced-4d32-9efc-550012e2a756|We can see the proteins here.
e9a4fd96-c13d-4fef-911c-4b4e50f75748|Labels are for clothing, not for people.
4795b3b5-fc03-493d-a881-4914978191bd|I give you food, shelter, clothing, and career training.
a14266c0-3e21-4e77-a885-1e958111216a|So now Henry dresses up in girls' clothing.
ad2e6bbf-643d-41a2-b7d9-f3b48d971430|Then you must use your power and proceed quickly.
af448034-4b4b-46de-b79a-42f191524543|Now how shall we proceed?
92ab2ed5-1f89-43bb-8214-87b3ecb37b72|Take the necessary steps so that she may proceed.
5a286211-04cb-43ea-bc18-0045a8f3a957|Then how do we proceed?
8fb01f24-a92a-410b-8148-a5b335c3cb9b|Let me tell you how things should proceed.
0e6e1539-ce80-4636-b95b-b81a5b74ad15|Given the fiber content, I imagine quite a lot.
cde83047-b4d2-4dfd-ac6d-97d84eeb1a3b|He's always been lacking in moral fiber.
9a6c439d-e648-4025-81a3-2dededd148ab|I got to find a way to react.
c5d3a875-3092-4f65-8713-3e49b3593c6f|Who knows how she'll react to an approach?
49ef102a-c024-4c29-b490-8a7a45eb64e7|I wanted you to see how he'd react.
1ef9c0c4-00af-45b1-bb86-d8ff397f3d05|How did your parents react?
742753f9-71bc-47e7-a27f-a0d5633b373d|Okay, bottom line is that Ray is right.
d049aebc-b58c-43f1-b053-2277c0116b9c|The bottom line is, I like you.
8c48c054-b899-472e-9e19-1d093b3bb9be|Because nothing matters but your bottom line.
5057e817-3a21-4400-8386-7391dbe9ef16|Aren't you in my spin class?
f7e70c56-28b4-4309-bfd4-62f757c1b21b|This man is spinning my words again.
1de179b5-e454-4ca0-bafa-51f7108c1a2c|You're working, you gotta spin.
c10e7ca7-eee0-4e70-9f80-56a46a4b8096|That's moving roughly a million a second.
716772ef-5263-423c-ac63-de732adec42c|You're roughly the same size as Lloyd.
1ec13ac3-5d76-46f8-8628-74c93d4cbb75|This is roughly what I looked like.
ad80c992-0561-47da-a621-9007785f6ada|Tell me how far, roughly.
bf40d1d7-3eb9-425a-8e16-a39ad1a5cba9|They're just wrapped up in their own drama.
d6059621-adc6-4c3c-8b1d-93d5b774ab27|I can't deal with your drama anymore.
d4fa15d9-ed50-4a23-82ec-f556e32f1c18|No need for drama here.
01318bed-6e0b-422b-b9e9-2024ce3da634|I am not at liberty to discuss that matter.
4323d42d-c4ad-457e-b3d9-7497d3e0a09d|Well, I've already taken that liberty, sir.
a1134757-2d01-4ffc-a9b5-6f54c96a5405|They'll leave her at liberty.
8ba2ac73-b199-4919-9103-a8bcc5d56e43|I want to say rose hips.
9234cc6c-fc1a-4f4e-aab4-0d4df9f6863d|You could carry that on your hip.
80477e42-bfd7-4743-8672-9d3c5279fff1|That's really good, but you've gotta turn your hips.
56032245-9f2a-474e-a0c9-9bfc54948b06|Take my hand and watch my hips.
00cf5364-3c6b-4b42-9986-afddeb7bbe74|It would make you do things with your hips.
3442feea-5728-4539-9717-fcdddbfa5ff4|I will pick up provisions.
012cf46d-b924-4827-a895-1f8d5d7c2a4d|Be ready in one hour with your provisions.
641c5c4b-83a4-48d3-bb7d-d621dc5f2493|Your weapon and some provisions.
2be0210e-ffde-42b0-be32-45899771a0f4|Even one person to share the burden.
41f879e7-969f-477e-b4b0-f425aaf8742a|Perhaps I fear the truth each burden will bring.
5e159142-3b27-401a-9dec-8ec8b6944110|Have to carry that burden any longer.
c92a005c-acda-4b7d-b287-30c1941404cc|Should a burden on society like you be talking?
79d3d687-31e3-46b8-856d-f85a8e5b6632|I don't want her to become another pregnant teen.
4786f438-fdfd-4458-8b7b-285fff7fc633|She had tough teen years.
c0c171e7-a9e8-4f9c-a311-d8946e062e6f|I've got a little teen crisis going on here.
0bfa7886-318a-4946-b799-3e126114e472|For more than your survival?
ca11ab06-e787-4093-b52d-8d07ab0d5032|We fight for our survival.
632e80ff-eeea-46e0-973d-d2529b9510b1|This order denies the people any chance of survival.
7ce6d009-5168-4bc8-822c-44233fefacec|What are the chances of survival at that age?
b551d29d-c7b8-4061-9c87-b3d89e1fe494|Your survival depends on this.
c5275168-2a1a-40f1-be93-2c347ee4f7c1|That seems to me very unlikely.
5e221401-3056-431f-859e-7c3ce9565535|I should think that is extremely unlikely.
57392d77-34ab-40fa-8ad3-20fdae5f86d4|And that's unlikely, is it?
1fd2e4d1-2ba4-4b7d-ac49-634ab7644750|Yes, but it's highly unlikely.
a3fc752d-aa69-495b-9cd7-a18ff6169230|At that Italian place across the street.
8d0a8fe5-cd02-49b5-8aa0-30d253dfdbf6|It is because he's not Italian?
1252c67c-b4c2-4ddf-81b3-b955fa58f746|I was thinking maybe Italian.
6d4903e6-7123-452f-913a-d4b7f4b93546|French support for your father's Italian adventures?
2397b936-2e9a-4f9a-bcd3-755e8685e6a0|How come you speak Italian so well?
51189040-6a1c-47e3-9829-2a74c4505521|Give me the details on the chamber.
1c20233a-5413-423a-baf5-64c0bccf7cbf|I shall tend him in my chamber!
4419e997-f001-4423-bc9d-80084052df55|Who else was in the judge's chambers?
bc8ac6d0-0efe-466e-9b5b-8bd07b4031d9|The chamber's on the other side of the wall.
25b41ebd-5a61-4ba3-99ca-5c291735cee9|Clean your weapon and get back to your chambers.
dac6c750-7ddf-489e-bf7a-222bd984eb80|Lost men gather here and find what they can.
b2735b8f-5946-44bc-a118-e6b03467874a|Lost my memory by chance?
8d26561f-c1f3-417f-b0b2-838a656c892e|Yes, sorry, because of my stupid kitchen!
8fcc5fad-2e72-4460-9b61-88ccf82c9ff0|And this just makes you stupid.
3b24ce27-6a46-4194-855b-e7da2cd6e3bd|We won't do anything stupid.
e9fcef7e-ac05-4053-a360-01c1704a6ad6|You can have your stupid stuff back.
a36d0f91-283e-4c8e-b23c-c6c32cbc7c1c|I bet it has a great story too.
dfa9e6cf-e653-4c81-9abb-bd2a101923f5|And now I bet they're gonna kill me!
3a293974-9d9d-4359-b831-2435930d7324|Yeah, I bet she would.
5ffffd10-751c-474f-925c-92c75e458ced|I bet you don't know any.
03685318-1210-452f-a63a-a7e41fb919ea|Oh, I bet you'd be good at it too.
61cdb79d-b021-4029-881b-85335d04a507|He's very advanced for his age.
8b7fadbd-4328-4fce-8e09-1a3a1e19d297|They're too advanced for that.
afe62314-0051-47f3-84b4-c6a72769662d|We're advancing him too quickly.
b6aa3eb0-3b4e-4dfd-81c4-63704edede3f|Muslim woman at a bar in an American hotel?
4ff469c6-677a-44cc-81ae-e592c33bb470|It's my Muslim name and I like.
fcb57b63-6355-402a-893a-1cee22534ff2|I should never have married a Muslim man!
4431383c-09d4-4218-9ae3-b4e789a24273|Not a lot of Muslim metal fans, I imagine.
c68bc713-98b3-4b0e-b77b-9da7df5815c1|It was a new Muslim city.
86ab80d0-7620-4bc3-93c2-518de937b5e5|Sounds like the dinner bell's ringing.
e1d7b3ce-ca85-4b47-9362-4644b95507ce|She'll be sitting there with bells on, believe me.
859feee2-7d76-421f-b6af-f11a4fd8a30a|Why does it ring a bell?
e7ced13b-e2f8-449c-bf31-9cb0bf8b243e|So, any of that ring a bell?
f8b98b24-cab0-44ef-b5f1-b02db2262492|You wouldn't want that served with onions!
512cbd40-c191-4f67-aadb-1fc1f48d0a26|I didn't put too much onions in, Paul.
24bc6cdd-2f8d-4f9c-8c77-6690ab2310ea|Why does everything smell like onions?
bec38f00-e0d7-44c3-abbe-67d6b9429a4e|It's a lot better with real onions on it.
abfd695a-67fb-40c0-9ce6-68081a52d1dc|Yeah, I don't disagree with you.
0247e460-fe05-447b-bf7f-97f5a5b34064|I do wish I could disagree with you.
5204815d-bb1f-4d4f-963b-3741703d560e|But our new partner disagreed.
dfb9edd0-6183-416c-a054-f75f143c4bb3|Got to disagree with you there.
b50fafe4-a223-436c-aae1-a59fd5e73a71|Well, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.
34669c7b-7a74-4ef4-9743-645ebe2cc4be|You don't give away a cabinet.
3c9a7370-1ed7-4ac5-ab44-b5ab86f7f4f5|I've got a cabinet in there!
f445e0a8-d10c-46d9-9408-6f6ef5487a41|Did you see the key to the gun cabinet?
7f357df7-3df3-4a7c-b879-d0a5c56780ac|I had no idea he was so broken.
e9edc4c6-f845-49d3-8355-6cdfce9d9c4a|I was just as broken as Joe was!
42f1b183-43a4-447a-b5c9-199596619764|That thing with the broken glass?
0c584420-3967-49e8-92cb-e051cfd03b03|How would you like it broken?
d12b5f2b-43ec-4859-89f8-b8af9046c66a|And that's when I saw the broken mirror.
84ec1154-b8ba-412b-9c20-c3a0167c698c|The latter ain't up to me no more.
3da83f99-903a-4d43-ba79-20d18a2161ec|Tell me it was the latter.
3a4a89e1-45c5-4c6a-965d-7137e143b2cb|I'm here to take the latter away.
378a30ea-106e-4812-8e2e-8e75329b22ed|And we here in America, we shall overcome.
2fb6d9de-d83d-4aff-856a-15f85e67ba76|So that no darkness shall overcome our world.
3fadf147-64e9-4c46-b0fe-4a168115c2f8|But you can overcome it.
05f58826-2df7-4c8b-a43e-24dcf72c774b|You see, science has overcome time and space.
12cc7eac-2835-47ad-b255-3c55acb5b6c6|Maybe she wanted you to overcome something she couldn't.
24b5e2f4-92e7-48c2-9422-a748eba5104c|How many viruses have you tested against?
82bedb7b-f2b5-4831-b870-23c802f3a3ff|What sort of virus are you?
35e55a09-6ec5-42a9-980a-6a7644b7e2c7|What do you think, it's some virus?
ea049933-3d07-4b9b-9d92-4e0c71851d0a|Every virus, every human being.
33215172-6f60-4966-9a44-f38d30b3e3b9|I've been studying this virus.
7a1531a3-0f03-4cce-8933-8418aa2da31f|They retain parts of their former selves.
3b826501-373f-4b6e-805c-94a5393bc2ef|You must permit that I retain the box.
7a7068da-56f3-457f-ab08-47ea2a138b64|I secured the area, and I retained order.
93b2ed22-2508-4b14-9a0f-d95bcd5a6aaa|He's got some prizes, extra visits.
8b9685fb-3fce-4ec0-b80d-bdf12d9b8951|You work out something with the prize people?
4008f398-4839-40a9-b9e8-9ce334acfaac|If that's the prize, I am in.
3396c139-d0b1-4df9-a807-71ca52fdf2f9|He's the only one who could pull those strings.
aae37503-1932-46c3-b29b-a295c386ff2c|She has you on a string.
3261537e-4e15-4186-b695-1b9b90f3469d|Look, I'm going to show how the string works.
197e303f-4130-41d9-b9e2-2e552ee89152|The nice exhibition director will invite you.
87ba68e8-cae1-479e-88c0-14b15c2dd55d|And he's not including you in that expansion.
6906a61e-6d9d-4832-a10c-9e648f79a4f2|I wouldn't handle your coming expansion alone.
cd6bedbe-404d-4d2e-8b2c-582409976195|This is obviously a tremendous shock.
1448b75d-4b6c-4e06-8b7c-2affa0d07993|In her hands, it has tremendous power.
68fb439a-44c9-4d10-8fd9-e7a68d13bc2c|The woman hanging by her hair was tremendous!
c1dfee5d-a6fe-45c2-a0e4-a3ec58ac64bc|Apparently, you have a tremendous influence over this woman.
a29ced87-dd94-4ce2-8a1d-69f3df25fc09|Well, I say you're all a bunch of children.
be8b61c4-bc07-44f2-8da4-92a68f093ffd|It's a bunch of dudes on a tank.
747ddca6-6389-412a-8fba-dfc5fb32d865|Who cares about a bunch of birds?
ae46120c-c9f8-4c16-a01f-df57dc197ef5|A great bunch of reporters you are.
b4e0acc2-1350-4ae8-843b-95905e6d541c|The assistant director wants to see you.
95582508-7372-494b-9775-f27abee74583|He became my research assistant.
ff5e8c96-5f6a-45b9-8a14-9d2422f5d004|He hired an assistant, turned down other work.
75fa86aa-3da3-45ab-8baa-df2df9fe4d0b|Have you become his assistant?
256528bf-51db-402a-8190-8de5a7939e7b|You are the best assistant I have ever had.
0d01b88e-1d46-44de-8ce9-ac596716da0a|Initially I was, but the house is great.
d92403a8-649b-4f15-a826-ab486cb70df4|I had my doubts initially, but everything worked out.
90c6ee88-2626-4afb-93f3-619aea5aa08a|Then he's smart, and accurate, because I won't.
8c8f83e1-3426-491c-8f9c-53dc823a84aa|Let me be absolutely accurate.
c05afb11-e645-4fb6-85be-dd9fccb73292|A more accurate name for this place?
2e00be8f-feae-48ab-9ec3-f16084906d6e|What is that on your cheek?
061d7db9-5133-447e-8cfa-c2fb737b3694|What's wrong with your cheek?
0a31adf7-d8e4-41eb-a2d1-2c88354db6d7|How much you got left, sweet cheeks?
a15f92b3-7f65-4418-8214-a98ee694e03c|All right, let's get this going, sweet cheeks.
70c0b96b-d1d5-450e-a8ba-b2be459da9f4|You said he was missing the index finger.
318a7bba-80fc-4681-853a-fb57bd8664fa|Get this: It was the index finger.
bba04e2a-0698-4f49-a37d-0c21bc4d41da|Now look at the time index.
7d7cf62d-aedb-4963-9430-603d975c2886|As long as I'm the index.
38958edc-15c7-4c9f-82bd-edb1d2edc9bd|Can't tell if it's occupied.
3432458a-5dac-4895-b2bf-03ae2898bd65|And I currently occupy the moral high ground.
754877f3-7d6b-4dcd-8e54-1b4376a7c474|You need to occupy your mind.
ff0bebde-c1b7-4416-95f3-827c452db74b|How come you get all the cool gear?
568d91d0-5609-4ab2-b2ae-7f07c7bad973|I'm getting sand up my gears.
39b6a6c3-e96e-4dc1-8a37-fb4f3e51458b|Maggie really came through with the gear.
3ec87b1f-6ce5-4afe-ae53-71e5e2297521|And that's why you're on the gear.
4bdf619f-da4d-42ca-9714-4be1e598c438|How are we coming along with that gear?
b9b42331-640d-474a-954e-980758b5cdba|I want your guarantee they'll be left alone.
2f3839cf-3d89-4874-8716-8253d3272610|We'll ask around, but I can't guarantee anything.
3ce60e63-5a96-4057-a05d-698b7692f610|And you guarantee that'll get me off?
1cab2308-753c-4ce0-acc0-9dd7c2965129|Do you remember the hot chocolate?
c7380f71-c429-4ed8-a229-a2c21a66aaf6|You know, chocolate says that even better.
609cfd2b-ab4a-4f75-b6c0-ba9062cdd277|I get some hot chocolate.
df938a6d-c840-4b27-ab7d-66bf00c56912|Give him the ceremony he deserves.
4b7034fd-1c8f-410b-bf87-aa670ae9d387|I didn't see my dad at the ceremony.
f416cefd-6ba8-41e8-859c-e82e08b3765c|There's a ceremony she taught me.
17c5b564-b223-4cb7-a7ed-212cbbfc0d85|I must stop myself pressing the button.
7a8ce2a3-a71d-4008-9cc2-ca741c2b801d|There are too many buttons in the world.
b9fdd7ec-434f-45ca-983b-3eb5f48569a6|Just push the button right now, guys.
dfe3b6ae-9e02-4161-9d80-a73f6dc51cbe|What are you doing he, shopping for gas?
5a505206-116c-410b-8519-50a83787d73a|We were shopping for clothes.
922d9647-3702-4d61-954c-b8f5d27cf41a|You might consider shopping somewhere else.
8dd70c1c-6453-4dcc-9a66-292f11f6c18c|What are you shopping for?
f5dbf2cd-4758-4157-b04f-383976766ac9|How's he gonna pay for the other five billion?
1172ae5c-c471-465f-9508-333e53f3fdce|We need to talk about our last week's pay.
ffa05dfb-8ca8-4987-b94d-b6f2f481e9ef|They're not gonna pay for that.
870fb662-9877-445f-a5b7-22ea988f859b|Pay close attention to what I'm going to say.
8e596eb5-fd95-416d-bc98-71f173434a38|And for that, for that you're gonna pay.
5b70a3f6-0659-47fb-a14c-c548ac46c312|This is what happens to Iraq, all disputes emerge.
2d2e6714-99e5-4718-b818-aba7ae5e4976|Are you involved in any legal disputes?
226a3e5a-2582-4fec-9f80-6096390c54fd|Unless you continue to dispute my claim to it.
36cd45b5-aa8b-4917-8b7e-770c3f055855|I'm liking this job, Rick.
ada67312-a61a-433b-a6c6-58499a577275|There's no furniture when the house is this big.
e62e2751-8ad2-4e63-9246-7c53ede61ec8|I don't have furniture at my place.
d501f8d6-6685-492d-a4c4-d897aa0ec7fa|Jerry, you need any new furniture?
5c7d4af0-33e9-4d0a-8cca-cfdf01d2b2fa|She thought he was on the road, selling furniture.
31bc5459-a76f-4f42-bdb3-c6f75e5271ec|I could drag some furniture.
6ef0cabd-b4dc-4ad5-b83e-7dce6da167ff|You want your marine, come to me.
168e408b-05cb-4201-8b48-73223c7a953e|Let's get some serious -- serious marine Tom.
6ac5879c-5ca9-4d28-8b34-48ca5e9513fc|There are worse things than death for a marine.
a4d36862-0421-4e63-9735-2e957ad32837|Okay, marine, drop and give me twenty!
5316c083-d06b-48d7-ba01-608a27105280|I know a lot about you, your Olympic career.
a689e60a-a349-4eb2-a6a2-431a871634ee|My parents were Olympic athletes and look at me.
64ecf8f1-8398-415f-b44b-b34fe85522e6|You'll never be an Olympic champion!
420a568c-b2d3-406e-84fc-5d3c9c22a0e2|That was after her Olympic victory.
885d4841-948b-4f58-9679-8e7373c60edb|Do you think olympic athletes do this?
59c52cdf-1c0b-4459-a725-49940297dd97|As mayor, I balanced the budget eight times!
14bf4203-083d-4d45-87a0-44bb44c1d1a1|It ain't balanced for no long ride neither.
c2a1ac25-8861-473d-be5e-85c4980adb09|Okay, you want to know about being balanced?
9ead9492-0cfd-4f1a-b47f-3b64c617e7a1|He isn't balancing at all.
9c71f131-9071-4b5f-9164-bc77388dd1c8|Turns out the hard drive's been wiped.
fe7a3391-150f-4255-b714-fd595d155c73|You're the one who wiped our memories clean.
894f9820-e0d4-4b54-88c5-03740492e7dd|Thomas had all video at the prison wiped.
7e54ba57-d3e6-4e23-8789-754e16a96feb|No, I wiped them all off.
f2b52ffc-9163-49f0-87d6-1cedfe98e82b|Who made you our spokesman?
8904897c-0b60-4360-a019-1897da5f39e7|What are you, her spokesman now?
e1774ca7-2cdf-4cb4-b81a-0708a85d7391|You're a good spokesman for Matthew's vision.
dd2149fa-3246-4da0-a053-0e395fd0552a|Have you been having a super great time today?
25a62e99-da1f-4864-a2dd-100a06f19c0b|It was super easy to come up with.
39ce4a73-6c2f-49b4-8cc8-1be2ef63a82e|Whatever you did was super bad.
53abd391-1603-43ac-b344-75f876234ae3|I have a super important job just for you.
11beb54f-acc3-4531-bb81-ccb306094e2a|It is pretty super, isn't it?
965f5d80-3bff-4cf6-bbd8-d2ad8f57273f|They are a part of the Islamic front.
770ecc06-9ede-47a1-a77c-80430aa90108|We're leaving here for a real Islamic city.
9d0302ad-aea7-4515-b7fc-c5f2dcfa5836|Have you been able to track where they've been?
26290cfb-e2ec-45df-bfe1-201ba33c2753|I'll track down Annie myself.
32b03b40-1eab-4e68-8386-5f3c722e6693|Well, you want me to track Sam down?
4d937af9-1cd7-4a76-a485-f430eea03a44|You wanna translate that into speech?
06916573-5212-40ed-9f99-b779b0cb089f|Do you need me to translate?
cb43d247-b967-4d5a-9cdb-8d816abc87d0|Oh, I wish I knew how to interpret them.
55a3381d-a632-4c5b-b084-31bc5c3a3dbd|No, it depends on how I interpret it.
48092fef-67c5-4857-aac9-dfe26fdba574|It's part of my job to testify in court.
12f769e5-e7ba-4832-b4b4-58eb2b34cdf2|We're gonna need you to testify.
da5a96e5-7a3c-4581-87a3-9bc49f831795|There's no way they're ever letting you testify.
685d87e5-3bc9-46da-84c7-e1c9d2b57d1d|Becoming friendly with that boy down there.
227068c1-3186-41f1-8eb9-cdc99ada2929|I'd like to give you some friendly advice.
ec55708b-2466-48f3-a6e4-1d62fc97974f|Well you're still friendly, right?
a1f4f15b-b7e9-47d4-91f8-61b07e51e85c|Never seen you be so friendly to another creature.
0f53b914-1953-439e-830b-9ef4bc6a5bfc|Whose profile are you working on?
5d7d9d6a-cbfc-473e-858b-51d3e33757bb|Just don't look at her profile!
d885c6f9-7e51-4560-8c47-342417a6ca4c|Most of us shouldn't turn profile.
3d2eac67-6db4-48de-8260-85053fee34ff|We have to keep a low profile.
3f4a0868-55fd-4d2d-b101-44008bd9b6b6|It was on her profile.
57345905-91b5-4bd7-9763-db3767e92dba|I want to have white pants too.
b556e051-1bfe-4a45-95f0-b9a872b99f0a|You need to put your shopping pants on.
d1c86cca-0610-4ad8-9bae-4082a355ab8f|You know what really burns my pants?
3342f456-1279-41fe-b2a0-7632fb568ea3|And you have on no pants.
6162ad1a-8a1c-4e03-a5eb-f0aeb53215ee|Whereas I have never missed one.
c2798320-0c11-4700-b383-168f496d4f75|Whereas I can't wait to get on with it.
7314a1a4-f622-49cf-83fa-865aecbe69a9|Whereas I have a child I can't acknowledge.
d3e5dca6-4d48-4eb3-8fb3-d7592c83853c|We honor him by continuing the fight.
06ef0ff2-1018-48c2-a54f-92568165452a|This is a dinner to honor my father.
bace34b0-d028-456a-aca8-bebdfaa29f23|I knew you'd come back to honor Michael.
a5821ea2-f419-4c90-8c52-4f274d3a1cf7|And I'll honor it, if you do.
635d2830-e0b6-4233-85e0-5ad64157c3cd|All the photos of you with the Washington elite.
c74c8f3f-776e-4895-bce6-2c3b3d08aeb3|But what the hell's wrong with this elite?
8b60bd44-bb83-45d3-9042-f6cd6a03738b|And don't you play any criminal elite.
3ffc6883-cd6e-48a2-8ca9-cd74e33e5b81|Okay, she's been in decline for a while now.
b17b1b50-6121-4428-b9c0-25781b2f488d|Well, it's to avoid a decline in quality.
a2a48623-fe13-4299-ae79-ff427493ba5c|A sharp decline in their standard of living.
2f2e3ae5-df0b-4925-a0b1-ff08399da802|Well, as declines go, death is fairly extreme.
8a55d5b7-7e49-4a15-8669-badd5b13daf0|Why weren't you at the port last night?
a8d9dafb-bd59-4564-a22f-aa3232c133b0|Your gun ports are in attack position.
be193657-2839-45a0-af6b-f2bebb5d83c3|Your cousin's gonna have to find another truck.
ff9940c4-8356-44b6-b918-fe6f28fc4a51|She really kind of looks like my cousin.
6b818c8d-0681-4e49-ad15-210bafc65d2d|Looks like that's game, cousin.
92e10383-8b27-4fe0-9418-18b9365d8d76|Oh, I know, she'll call her cousin.
9cec25f9-0c19-4370-92f3-0ceb0740b167|And william bell is not a terrorist.
bb6039fc-2d4b-4290-ad96-b4af4c72a3e2|Sale went down, so did the terrorists.
94db92fd-5172-4669-b2d1-05de827bfba7|I don't know, a crazy guy, a terrorist.
67394a55-f3a9-4832-86f9-f79217fb9eac|We must never, ever, ever give in to terrorists.
816dbaa6-48c8-4bb0-bff4-0a5e80dc806c|They're going to go off the chart soon.
5cffe618-84ea-4944-afbd-3be7648dfd93|I spent an hour today on the seating chart.
ad97c2c2-20dd-413d-ae22-e055c1b41828|It's also written on your chart.
b341b6bc-776a-461d-80fb-3ac5b0536d06|I'm not here for a personal chart.
6a6b5de0-cce3-45df-8a3a-dce6589e3ab6|Now get me those drawings.
a161e25d-c72d-4b66-8e19-8e6bb4f8394a|I still don't get why though.
d36a287e-7bfd-4945-b336-18e93774227e|I don't know who would read it, though.
bb9f272b-0b42-4a04-a3be-698ecc1e52c6|I'm just warning you, though.
e9543b72-94cb-4cee-96fe-16adc59b5a31|How do I put this gently?
607de788-9ecb-477f-8646-b4343bca64d2|Mr Gently, I've got the meeting just now.
83f6ceaf-8069-474c-9096-072dfe797d0c|I hope you let them down gently.
529dbe5f-fc70-435a-88e7-f36d663cdb87|Perhaps I should have broken the news more gently?
32ba7c34-5f88-4b86-ae58-ffd9011570f9|You know, a wolf is actually a pack animal.
2748d593-2e24-4d1c-8d39-96c223a85fd1|I don't care what the pack says.
9dc4a6c0-bc91-4235-a7d5-f301c95fa5d5|I've got an ice pack somewhere.
c70ce554-3095-4351-a08c-e6b0da7fe1aa|Why do they have to travel in packs?
4883032a-33bd-48bf-96eb-1f81e7df2928|Then, do you need any odd jobs doing?
eb04c672-67de-48d6-a07b-ce2c2e91fbd7|It feels odd being back.
0ba70bee-c41a-41fc-982d-3c8e590f8778|Then again, my parents are odd people.
302f85e6-f608-4e86-81e1-83c8e09ec3a2|And it seems odd that you know me.
06140752-db30-4968-9aa4-f4c793bb6a57|There's something odd in that.
332abf02-70d3-4886-addd-0fddf7a5c0ca|The page view incentives in your contract.
4ce627be-d2a8-41a3-be98-60d6564064fe|He's not talking without some kind of incentive.
cef47d32-8fce-4bff-85fc-2dddd32f86ff|That's why I sent you a little incentive.
72c3e508-5c39-47d0-ad1a-348ece862aca|Maybe I used the wrong incentive.
72c1e1c1-0c13-4015-b77f-868df9a18ef3|Shouldn't you deny it if you're innocent?
00976857-9b61-4be4-9818-4a4246826c17|Just look at her, so innocent!
7af9bd87-b620-422c-b87b-b3842d85647e|But it also proves he may be innocent.
85b848ad-9504-424b-bfb2-cdbbf780cf88|We can't let an innocent man go to jail.
93f35062-f6bd-4e4d-b4be-2508ee7f96e4|Because I thought the guy was innocent.
c9ddc2b9-917e-4cdf-9ceb-8245a0fded85|What exactly are you implying?
74cd764d-f869-46a1-ae81-fc0221ff92d6|By which you're implying the other thing wasn't.
42deb3d2-08de-4864-9ce2-511218367f5b|I don't know what you're implying.
5f5bd35c-52d8-4ca9-98b7-200979a1a262|Just what are you implying here?
183f9ec5-1c87-40ce-9906-17575bc90d88|I can taste it already.
90bff9f0-daf2-490c-ba28-cb4317bae8a6|Then let us taste what you are made of.
e04745fd-7f91-47a6-a92f-fa1edb55a095|I have not tasted wine for many years.
9fc2a804-9c01-4b58-bf9e-54714e8e4a42|I promise you taste better.
adf61b45-883f-4d30-9a70-07111c839693|All the stadiums have them now.
eaf84296-2f88-4d68-aa60-5dc69d2e8668|What happened at the stadium, it was beautiful.
c6cd50c5-7bad-43db-9408-2c16bdb94fcb|He's the only one fighting against the stadium.
ceb0be92-2bfa-4f80-abee-f06b268be03f|Worst case scenario, a year's jail time.
0880a0c2-b72b-4b3d-8dd8-c8c9f296359d|And, in our present political scenario, we should.
71fa29c0-40ba-4daa-a02e-84d5bdb8729d|You're dead, too, in that scenario.
2a6fd5a5-25be-46a0-bccb-467f59defb3b|Let me lay out a few scenarios here.
61730945-7282-498c-a5b9-17402b41004f|What does it mean, all that shooting?
50209f56-1c35-4951-a10a-2318f72cc722|We're in a shooting war, people.
dc2f5c87-cfd4-4f0d-8dd9-5b26d3ee8aaa|But shooting at you certainly didn't help matters.
579d7abc-0147-4c5c-9602-b9e5eb5310b2|That was a good shooting, captain.
af041d00-6045-4bcf-85f8-1c9af5a42c8f|The city's gone crazy since them shootings in January.
fe18d545-1f20-4da6-8403-41934a277c0b|The truth is, I'm not really your blind date.
4ccc2e32-c18c-4665-8b57-29d28cd6c2a8|And yet we are completely in the blind.
a324dde2-a0ed-4b13-8ecb-55a5e74faf86|Well, I've been on blind dates before.
89268a44-8b7b-4da0-b006-1ad23ce347ae|Don't get any closer, or you'd get blind.
639d2fe2-12d1-46e7-9edc-ef72dfa323da|The whole school, everyone, at Wednesday assembly.
3868eacd-f35f-430b-8b0f-1082cc7a862e|You may report back to the jury assembly room.
2909ed51-12b5-4634-90b6-018a3a4ff238|Are you telling me you think I should withdraw?
e6a67023-0415-4d3a-ac0a-ccc8129f1025|Yes, I'll go to the bank and withdraw everything.
c7bbe4f8-236f-436c-a1af-843728886aa7|You see now why we need you to withdraw?
0b3c8e58-dd5c-4336-b42e-031a770e90f1|I'll withdraw that and offer this instead.
f9aa0dae-0358-4779-bb95-7951c280895f|Come on, this isn't a strip club.
84594ce1-1e0e-4a56-826e-533b6dcbdf0b|Even the strip club is dead.
20f7a8e7-c56c-40db-98be-e878fb85db48|We just need to market ourselves.
f5083cc2-7c94-4bd8-bcb6-e3071608fda5|Yeah, how am I supposed to market that?
4a2589be-e746-420e-b9a3-0459782b4a53|He came on the show to market his hospital?
639f7429-ffea-4f6f-9e29-efdb689cdce3|Where are we with friends or lovers?
bb7576d4-b53e-45a9-84f6-bd043fb8c62e|She was going to meet a lover.
e8dd85cd-a7d3-4a8a-8591-06325bd6ebca|I take it you're an art lover?
eab05842-24ed-417e-8e40-158d6fb7133e|Because they think I'm your lover?
6ef031be-9892-4b63-814d-b00969d5e1ee|She's going to see her lover!
da8b56a4-f2af-4fdf-babb-3dfa82ff3ff6|I need time to process it.
4d0d2454-f6a1-4ac9-8d5f-416505dbfab5|Chris, can you process my guy?
f5cfbe3a-fb2a-4746-9388-da730c8e59ff|All right, I'll get started processing inside the house.
e65b7015-a651-483a-9cf6-eec4603d1a10|The crime lab's still processing them all.
568cedb8-5b70-4e52-bb5a-5b7f8d3ce701|I'm gonna need these processed today, Eva.
e635165f-743a-43ef-9731-c62b357008db|But mainly it's because people don't like me.
db43f77f-b843-4306-9459-71a4bdffb08e|Mainly because he's got bad knees.
7a0b5604-1092-41ec-ab27-97489de1dfcd|I mainly write software for people.
1537069f-95a6-41f6-a69d-09c57ffc0b8c|But mainly, he thinks they have a connection.
92d7c8f4-a7d0-404c-af18-c57929ec89f1|For everything, but mainly for the study.
fe91b9aa-37df-4600-9aa9-3eb108a3ce95|But wouldn't these normally come before an aircraft lands?
37a4c180-95e6-46a7-8bbc-77901cc43a8b|It smells newly painted here.
23b09191-ab70-4cd6-91a8-318574f866dd|You know how newly married couples do.
8c290968-e51f-4600-8612-40045be0f229|I mean, some of us are newly single.
9d642c10-6dd2-4816-8d9f-437392c7896a|You would be valuable to a newly formed military.
51364c23-6add-4b4d-aa0a-7e6297fbc196|He's not gonna bring -- it's not ideal.
05062d1e-69dc-4d2e-9450-4811569c7f28|Australia is the ideal place to start over again.
9e5459d8-d5bf-46f7-a98c-7c7e568cc482|He might be getting closer to his ideal target.
b82426c1-3680-4883-b880-1d7c4a7e2190|I might slip, like on dirt.
3d6b65c3-65f8-479c-9f9d-060c505ec13e|I got dirt in my special place.
8452edf0-c0f4-4b5b-92ed-82dd64873c67|Walk three miles in all that dirt?
6bc277d5-7cae-4e54-be65-55abd22ea5fa|And your spring will flow better than before.
7bef721a-eb08-46c4-8c7b-da4a3ecbb640|It all flowed into the lake.
f2ca7482-4aa3-4e38-b121-d7ded2df8cd7|You prefer your blood to flow, or your friends'?
abf46721-5a7e-4d87-bd24-bb6d5c6726e6|And it flows through you too.
278446bc-9a50-4ba8-a325-db3492765080|But you're gonna have to respect my boundaries.
9c7265b3-23b0-4cce-b082-e995762d7708|A man who pushes his boundaries ultimately finds them.
51bdb927-04d3-4288-ac09-ab71bbf2af2c|I clearly have issues with my boundaries.
874b4eab-516a-4d4d-b873-f40ba686f7c2|She just stayed at the resort.
55e12aa4-eec9-45df-8909-04d67e1fca3b|You'll have to build your holiday resort somewhere else.
92447251-10f8-424d-b31a-07b59c2471f6|That was supposed to be a last resort.
d34b70c0-e2a2-4c93-9f07-10d9a19cdc30|Perhaps we can put together your genetic history.
10cd2f8c-ccee-4ec2-b93c-c7e168bc80d1|Then it's most likely genetic.
2a28e7da-aa4a-4825-8c46-7d016865ea59|Names of people who have a certain genetic profile.
5f15f382-e0a0-4df3-9a16-9f10444caa96|We do do genetic typing.
bd677da7-b781-43fb-8e07-8ee327d60ae8|When I'm stuck with these dead sticks.
e8c8dc93-40f5-41f9-a8c9-9fe08b41e26f|They must hold the sticks like this.
108d6e5a-8acd-4baf-b87f-4eef89691f2c|You all carry dry sticks with you.
b0ed5751-9ed3-4b57-8258-0ae7177889cd|It's a man throwing sticks in the air.
8ef94990-3141-4435-8a1f-9f9e3ed4a0aa|And naturally, I am afraid.
02a22a03-8e5d-4222-8179-d9bbbbd9e9ee|But the offers still keep rolling in, naturally.
e1f3e9c1-807d-482f-bf7e-322df572beac|This couldn't have happened naturally.
649a0632-9356-496c-8db8-0ab72278be05|But doesn't lying come naturally to you by now?
d1e090bc-bf4c-49d2-b4aa-e3a97fe247d6|They cannot do without him at the ministry.
f37fa3f5-2bca-4b21-9c50-ff91b81b7f27|But my ministry must come first.
f43b3eee-f1c7-49fb-868f-1bddc8ae465d|With white dust, even the ministry takes its share.
5402a4cc-f5f5-4fbe-80e5-1acafd3f17bc|The ministry won't pay up so easily.
c04d6160-03c8-46da-9f15-5e0c069b0e6f|These are my financial advisers.
1cce8927-ea50-42be-bd8f-3db51697ddaa|I was with my campaign adviser.
2cfb31a3-539f-42ce-bcdf-9095dcbc8f2c|As national security adviser, I can help more people.
0ee04b0d-abdb-4185-bf03-e12a3f768aff|Now, your advisers will advise you.
081c29a2-9fbd-4545-8af6-e49475b2b2f2|Your financial adviser for the last five years.
0e275630-698e-4420-ad9f-b3949c6c94ae|Similarly, on your planet, I look like you.
3947ac30-0d35-4e17-9bfa-5f703b18137c|Similarly, I do not fit in the bag.
f6e53f72-26b4-4a64-90c8-78ca96829cd0|They must work similarly, right?
15303115-1cdc-4a45-85c1-b0d3dcd52fca|I can't justify half, Kevin!
62375e24-f5da-4749-97c7-54b08b453545|I didn't finish Brian's movie to justify what happened.
89162e06-8075-4b19-9c2a-bf292f0c2332|Your sales don't justify the size of your staff.
85d099b3-88f8-4528-9311-5eb53f4ccf3b|Enough weight to justify killing five men over.
6f370cf7-f2a7-4cbe-8214-aa008864b06c|There's gotta be wildlife out there.
a14cee6c-1fdc-4126-9218-02c3c534edf9|Why hasn't any wildlife been at him?
160c6141-2051-4023-b982-483d74f90728|I was in wildlife as a kid.
bb1131a8-5466-4112-9953-806424c301e8|They use these cameras to shoot wildlife.
e0c48a83-b542-42f6-a9d0-853d2dcf244f|You know my record on the bench.
0e7154a8-563b-485e-9dce-0fa931ac14d4|Three years, I never got off the bench.
1d16a35e-e6e9-4bde-b5e4-1e954bc67896|No, our office got him thrown off the bench.
ba096bf4-4ad3-4ff8-892f-73718d8b15c0|You were always on the bench.
450567e1-3a96-4714-815c-0960f7364c07|You said the bullet was meant for you?
d296d7fa-82a2-4ca2-ad29-c9b674665108|And now that bullet is headed right at us.
dc38c64f-c023-4ca4-b6f4-c96f1d4ee50a|He had bullet holes in his shirt.
39f901b7-8f67-4a9f-829c-44f59dd88ebc|It only takes one bullet to make a statement.
65dba8dc-a20d-48cf-9f50-cacff94deb4b|Does he have any bullets?
77d3a246-0db9-4788-a25c-33082904454d|We're still in crisis mode.
bdb61f59-4f5d-4ba9-a2aa-929ed6b34914|I'm just not in that mode right now.
a01eee43-12f6-41e3-94a4-f1507ae5a91c|We're switching back into night mode again.
5ba4c32d-0381-43e4-9250-7be0a89d7222|I was still in attack mode.
dc9b07dd-2025-4a74-8ace-6cc6d6ebb4ab|We're in full sport mode now.
7401d7c2-99f9-48d0-bdb3-ee41e917cc41|All right, Tom, let's get all this squared away.
cf87c642-bdbb-4848-a904-daffb8ebc796|We've been over every square inch of this house.
45e40c98-cb6a-4001-90eb-c3c9fe0e9ce4|We've checked out every square inch of his apartment.
a949714c-0afb-4bf7-a6c5-98e95061ba48|We were at square two, but now we're back.
276e571d-1897-41b1-905c-4e75d7543abf|You're the champion of not dealing with your problems.
ec3c571b-b6dc-4001-a8a1-a452ada9f25b|And now we're both champions of the world.
1c6ff97d-1007-43ec-b1fe-ae6b93e33c12|And my champion continues to do the same.
372b4c52-1c4f-4f2a-b88b-83ad5a15a04a|I dismissed him before hearing him out.
ba19daf6-4f25-4f10-bdd3-dbbf042af669|I thought it was dismissed.
00481c5e-b6b0-4b99-a02a-64621694b9d4|Miles has been dismissed from school.
4b760675-fc02-4771-b688-62429d5cca66|You can't just dismiss what I'm saying.
bc0e1d00-c355-4517-ad02-d124f6af1153|We've got a dead body below deck, sir.
f6410e84-df3a-4d44-bc76-ae8bc48fb76b|We need to get below deck now!
77b993d1-fff3-496c-8199-ea99b7a65897|All decks show ready, sir.
08d99f3a-2848-454a-a760-1b6bc6e9014a|Yeah, that was a lifetime ago.
69f010c7-9c5d-46b3-98d5-e71ab18172d6|I love her and true love lasts a lifetime.
346f5146-21e2-4ac0-ac52-38fc676137fa|I haven't done extensive research on purpose.
39c1d883-6c30-4370-b5d9-ba616c4832a1|You don't find me attractive, do you ?
6dc36b0a-09dd-4431-a87c-04e782b6084f|I find him very attractive.
5bb23b99-1b9e-4e8e-ae2b-b5c63d1f4744|It is that I don't find you attractive.
4ba2c5f4-8a13-404e-b731-ea084c07b59f|I am an attractive man for my age.
f459cf2d-64c1-4272-b284-c5eb1fc30f88|It hurts my eyes with its raw emotional power.
2300bcb3-3498-4d8c-9a58-cf0fa2ba809c|Oh, I love a woman who eats raw meat.
d5154c51-80fb-4a57-8642-978deb9a8b95|That is such a raw deal.
f1c88a29-a9ac-4480-9837-0feb92252c27|I said it wasn't your fault.
68335a6f-e41d-477d-9fcd-2250e46ccbb1|I didn't say it's your fault.
674ac21e-efcc-45b0-a3ee-408b0e50cfbe|If you have such ideas, it's my fault.
540733c5-b84f-459b-897f-bff95ecad15e|I'll tell her it was my fault.
14b4242b-82c4-4598-a7aa-92dfe22e70fb|Especially with all this clinical trial stuff going on.
9589ab8f-c5f8-40e0-bf18-4201df009571|Is that part of the clinical trial?
6f23ef14-8c85-4fd2-8324-c50b557055a9|It's also very important in a clinical situation.
e893515e-3191-412f-a9cf-c33ecaf188c3|Well, you make it sound so clinical.
76a60677-d882-447f-8663-24d19476a10f|Shut down the power systems before they detect us.
aa954340-c0cf-4743-86d6-fd28cc1be738|I detected that earlier, in the board room.
4bc14752-8d5f-4ea4-93d5-d221db487e27|Maybe they haven't detected us.
0d1d9c19-6ff2-4f92-9a04-f9a9d9cf40ad|First day of metal detecting school.
4b84cd6e-a8ce-44a3-b6cd-d78fbfdb976c|Perhaps you could teach me to detect mass.
b01debc5-493f-4eac-972c-ae698ee6837d|They'll be returned to you within three working days.
fc0a914f-11bb-4d14-98e3-0c0360846da7|Working murders is not your job anymore.
979b78f1-d185-48eb-8380-dcc076bb0e9c|Are you telling us the working girls are terrorists?
b5c420c2-128b-4dd1-b719-ddbe0b844ab0|I decided that's partly true.
67b5f0c6-80cb-4e77-9ab4-3ddb9510602d|And you were partly right.
cc400cce-6e81-4035-a953-5f925d22c40c|Partly because of your health insurance, And partly.
7924d8d8-5cf0-413b-a419-d44bb48f16cb|Yeah, I mean, partly yeah.
8be41e16-9a74-4192-8e21-46a80a46d014|And I'm scared to ask, what is your platform?
64363b7f-b8d8-488a-a4d2-094c80b96231|Sounds about as remote as you can get.
d6e7d58e-cf73-4a64-8f35-f36ce2c5a895|Why'd you take the remote outside?
a3a70c7c-3c83-4e70-8334-42c88d27fe2b|We were doing a remote from there.
0ca5e145-dac0-4f9c-9b0b-5fdecf878df6|This place is very remote.
75bc6396-3426-4578-8194-226fdd727c04|I might enjoy seeing you guys play the blues.
d80e3835-9505-4811-bafe-457ae1f58fb7|All right, how did I end up blue?
e986e377-5193-4cbb-ab62-5c13ee2d00e5|The one in blue is Albert.
722fa12e-f048-4c27-9d4a-e21092ee3024|He didn't respect everyone here in school.
20e53825-c750-44c9-8da1-74098a3097f3|Oh, that's because he doesn't respect us.
508441ac-d47d-4925-a4bb-a88f63183b73|I mean, I respect what you do.
530ce25a-71e2-4d0a-a243-ad5c46b22552|If you stay, I won't respect you.
2f5180f3-a8d3-4c60-a50c-f7b1de916c3c|People respect him, and that's half the battle.
c7def871-01c1-4bae-8a22-aa36052afc7b|The daughters have only small fortunes.
cc5fdc91-040b-4b57-a4e7-2bfe1ae8603e|I don't make a fortune either.
13b9bade-e792-4357-830f-94c16a002662|When they die, it'll be worth a fortune!
cd38f01f-4efc-47c5-96f0-5484ca32d5f0|In some cultures, he'd have to be your slave.
b56fc241-21d5-43b2-aefb-a03040575700|I don't regard him as a slave.
d8915ae4-fcf5-4939-b770-d209de69cb30|But I'll make a slave of him.
4d681b5f-b6ea-4c83-9acb-d9a2a8448e53|It must be a slave and his owner.
9f49ebe6-ca0c-441d-88b2-6c54734da61d|I will no longer be your slave!
b8daf77e-2ac5-4549-906b-59e91f758c7a|All vital signs were perfectly normal until after delivery.
06aee02a-3204-4fb9-900e-b8e1c3e70cf8|This is why we should get home delivery.
d3b05987-612a-46c9-b522-fbaf4aa5144d|That's why he used it as a delivery drop.
136ca957-dd0e-4856-bf1f-d973bd3e2112|But you know what deliveries are like.
58cfd54e-a8c1-4911-82d7-fa7feaf298fd|Okay, I think it's very much worth talking about.
f5acd722-cc67-4a13-a270-148aba948a02|Years worth of missing stuff returned in one night.
9b5bff40-8877-49d5-9855-74f5ef2b38da|I'm saying it's a question worth asking.
731d1898-5542-4918-bad2-e38b1af66f83|It's no reflection on you as a person.
b0af693b-17d6-4a20-99a7-cab41801d452|There's a reflection in that glass table.
f86145f1-5e44-4ce6-8fd8-526cb9bfffae|I can see the reflection in your eyes.
49537a5a-aad9-4cd5-9190-44769d6ec344|While drinking, he saw his reflection.
59105ec7-4cbc-4517-9c3e-fc8db77bdf42|You didn't think that was relevant to mention?
980ad41a-477f-4ce5-af4a-63ecd57cc753|What do you consider relevant?
b627754d-0dcb-4aee-b2ea-07bfbb409add|Because it's no longer relevant.
1a2f5d11-bfbe-4342-80dc-19badf68471a|We would literally be in unknown territory.
f2655d48-2fd5-4637-9fa6-9694e269d968|Unknown, but at least three.
4dcb8c1c-653b-4e1d-9a0c-44c0b93da0b8|I want the future to be unknown.
ede30de0-8761-4b35-b712-423176711988|And they can't be slowed down or paused.
698e7a24-de4b-457b-8f01-3999e38484d6|We'll be pausing for a short break.
0a5eac7d-b419-40e3-9764-cb34028994ef|We shall pause advance until your return.
d489af5e-0650-4621-b098-2754d290f868|He paused when you asked about the car.
f1c62a97-489d-4ce6-addf-8bcb790430c8|Likely slipped into his food or drink.
f576b509-3b5c-4550-a67d-c1411214b8a6|Somebody, somewhere, likely very senior, wants you dead.
b9374ec7-df3e-446e-848d-d9080adcb313|Look, I know what dead tissue looks like.
baedc7b8-3afa-4856-9a99-2d830e9f222e|You got these from the tissue samples?
6dab0742-8ba3-48ed-b775-c3ac6b3928ff|I was crying, so I reached for a tissue.
815d8562-9ba3-4385-85d9-1ec0c3277c9a|Arranging those cells into tissues.
60f406a0-32e1-454b-8188-223224bedce5|This tissue isn't from the victim.
50edc1df-adc1-4455-bfad-936ce0f9c0a2|I haven't sunk that low.
0aea982f-8b16-436b-b3cd-4b2b6774e0d2|I sunk him in the lake, all right?
e7d4b888-1d50-47ab-a938-81d70db2887e|But if he shoots, he sinks.
81347a89-64a1-4e62-aa09-2c9dfa952e14|Just put it on the counter there.
e80bc4ee-9460-4a6c-a043-827d6bf93f27|Okay, her bottle is on the counter.
42cd6d69-addd-430f-86a9-bacefe7ab408|But this counter is where they made the baby.
8de077f1-04bc-4a39-8e03-8883c9f4e719|Don't throw no Bibles in there.
d8a4ec14-7755-4c19-979d-45bedf86212b|You have been cutting pages out of Bibles.
eb695881-1ea8-403f-a2ee-b5f2f65043c7|You keep citing the bible in this moment, man.
bbf8f811-6760-4e63-85aa-57ced645b6cf|Because we forgot our Bibles is why.
562c7fad-b1aa-4767-9de4-5eb06c79baec|Oh, you just want to get your license!
5c3cdf6f-6e8d-4e9e-a489-458e14a54afb|Did you happen to get a license plate?
173cc3e2-999a-4d34-8f0a-6da500ee6299|You'd think they were getting dog licenses.
078f6b62-1df5-4d5a-abad-0fe0d096cef1|You know I don't have a license.
c3aa20d2-0ff8-430a-8dec-30123d88da47|I just want that you notice this tragedy.
24a40023-4050-4d20-a682-0ed8102d6665|She's been through one tragedy after another.
d4cb6ef3-c6fa-44b7-9df4-921ab33a294c|I need my assistant managers and Chuck.
c4da8627-1fa1-4f41-93c2-98a639c38317|That's why the assistant manager works Christmas and holidays.
58180da5-dd37-4b7e-9057-88bf915c2ec1|I had assistant in mind.
ae66fbd7-ddea-4a4f-a80d-5456e09a18ca|Did you have any dialogue with him?
a03edb79-4659-43a7-8d26-4dfcedfafebe|I mean this good dialogue will play.
693aa8c6-d7b5-4eea-86d2-2adfb511a210|Imagine a dialogue between him and you, now.
67734659-60f4-4952-be3c-1f2f0fc3c77e|Anything without dialogue was considered for slow motion.
704632a1-28b0-4580-bbe1-a21769521366|Fear you not my part of the dialogue.
9defd427-1852-4d64-a552-7f5b3c2fd3d0|It acted as a sort of mutual support group.
3edebd31-2a4b-4ad8-849a-af1ad57d1aef|Sometimes they're about mutual goals.
1a5aa6fd-df5c-4368-acd0-26e49e62122f|Well, I feel it was pretty mutual.
b60472f4-0f1e-4d60-816d-ddcb43c3dc7b|I'm just tying up loose ends.
f94b82d3-917f-4b5b-ad69-8e5b1bdfccf4|There's one loose end I'm leaving to you.
900795ef-984b-4a54-a0ee-a3029c2ca09b|There's a prisoner on the loose, girl.
46c7e2e0-79b2-4e24-a9b9-0d4e44b2f301|All you have to do is cut me loose.
887b5caf-3e72-41b3-ac89-a0ef7639c55d|You want internal or external line?
4d67caa8-9002-4f1b-a66c-f3ccf271e9a3|Everybody has been looking for an external enemy.
778b361e-ad40-4af5-afda-c46bb77ec71f|External signs are a direct match.
50cc62e9-2616-4fef-aff3-50fa8406b51c|I'm going to have to try an external version.
bc955287-84e1-462d-8191-4ab7208f17f8|Some of us sought external comforts.
c863fc03-971b-4600-9e8a-17d1dc9cf67d|It hurt his pride a bit.
87630ad7-c7be-4188-94c9-0e7d4ec1e4aa|You have too much pride.
3556ef10-5089-4f39-8b90-98e86674e71b|It hurts his pride and he beats her.
d58d2d6b-0ba3-4ea0-84dc-41f7e97e17d9|I've still got my pride!
ca62ff35-15f7-4063-91f1-75ea4e29b0ee|And a national school science awareness campaign.
9c18c71d-8bdb-4681-b33e-a41f306e1013|No, we raise money and awareness.
fcc5c2f6-7848-41f2-81f1-0c2d2438d186|You know, public health, drug awareness, something like that.
3f0fb2a6-28e4-4543-84f6-f854be10327e|Because we haven't built any product awareness.
22e97b66-ef45-42c9-bbaa-56723be9b7d8|There are so many friendly and diverse faces here.
f51c8fc5-ab38-4c64-87cd-2b3a9e78ffc3|Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there.
b2258cf3-9abd-406a-88f3-46072ed4747a|New York is a very diverse city.
b89bf18a-e6cc-45c0-9288-9eaafc4d49fa|I mean, it's so diverse here.
bb94f067-1a45-4646-b042-9995ffc0a188|You sure do have diverse fans.
23c1e4ff-c2a0-4d42-9fa6-9661dd0680df|Oh, this is one of my most advanced designs.
d88f1499-5e2d-48f8-82fd-f08a3d8709f0|He's had advanced training, so be ready.
b4d2cc89-c931-40de-a694-a8442f0d57e3|You mean me and my advanced notes.
2dd6c525-fb27-4785-b105-fcb06e4a3d9c|Somewhere warm with advanced medical facilities.
1b1ef6ef-f55f-4437-a0fa-773afa52788e|You just need to free my client.
3a7495d7-717e-4c14-afb5-a301d4aaf3b6|I will free you from this hell.
0a8839d3-6243-42c5-91ad-991c4cb9e604|Obviously, they will be freed.
290a2523-1e3c-4b51-8e05-c9e5004e0b53|You went online with it, didn't you?
9f3b1bdd-8914-4543-932d-acc8ee61a20b|When did you ask her to be online official?
611c3bd2-e8fc-4731-a634-3e6004b63cf1|I used to have an online business.
227141c9-e388-4e8e-a050-eb75e5cf6870|I can't get enough of this online stuff.
344385d0-43f4-4011-bf27-2baece7611a3|Do you have online banking?
6e19680f-c085-466d-9b0c-e8261df837f9|There aren't enough of us for an assault.
50ad493a-deee-41e9-b658-961d9b723287|Did you start smoking before the assaults or after?
83ce093f-e91f-457d-833e-84d713431bd9|Did you see anything that looked like an assault?
c7dafb09-34cc-469a-9958-b98e6ce04301|As the camp is ready for the assault.
6bb4941b-efd1-4893-9520-06e068fdb76c|He was arrested for assault a few years ago.
6f5e552e-3cf9-4bd9-8755-4a2211d763f5|Just, that she'd to go shortly.
3710ffe0-f359-44f7-8ad8-2dc688f23c95|Cops should be closing in shortly.
683a7ae7-3a13-42ea-8123-e305f5b765ea|Shortly after you had disappeared.
7da419e6-8a5f-4062-ab52-04e419cbbc57|She had an abortion shortly after.
24da41b4-b2dd-4868-aff5-e7bbe034a3c4|The company will be releasing a statement shortly.
1811b070-3375-4d40-81c7-f06adebd5d04|Do you work in finance?
d0ffbe49-c6ad-478a-abb7-ffcee8445973|A man's finances are his business.
f21ae99b-1835-4332-88f8-3c1bb7eacff8|But I could get some financing for you.
96866ba7-72a9-4dee-8b7d-53dfd0894b19|And we have the founders to thank for that.
ff551927-9526-4333-918e-eda08c256eb0|I'm the founder of our little group, Albert.
9e14948e-7f25-48bd-86d3-6935e4d2b1c3|The other founders would never allow that.
c89a97e2-99a2-46ee-8436-80d209f7c58e|To feel the pain his lie caused.
e830864d-a8b4-43c7-84c4-6f8674dc1bca|So, you've been telling lies.
c4160b9a-d6b6-4401-830c-cd2e130dc0a9|Lie to her, make up a story.
fe0b0bd0-05a0-4cde-a936-681a777e1cd7|She's been living a lie for years.
8cb8b0c8-301d-4d28-9bca-b56c44924c51|A massive protest is being organized in Detroit tonight.
9703ca62-415f-4073-a179-bc26c43fd259|Right on the steps where they're doing that protest.
bc912b64-f77f-40e2-9070-242ed7c4991a|Literally, we were having two protests a week.
f9165cce-47eb-46af-a768-1ee17a2fa582|Talk about poles with your balls in my face!
a5ac2064-b929-4064-a6e5-f1df5046835d|Put up that fishing pole and come home.
2530a989-6e03-4517-9de8-adccf6cf628d|Friends, look at these new poles.
2cda8514-087f-48e5-aa2e-cfa0a87aa864|What, is this a Communist country or something?
df0c410b-634f-4623-892f-12edf191413b|All Communist prisoners were shot.
fafef2b2-2eae-407a-822b-d740411a6af8|You think I'm a communist agent?
5815e6aa-9be9-4c33-8f93-86298cd9a273|There's an infection and I need to see him.
eabae363-9f1e-48f4-8743-df95b0983200|That's why he can't fight off this infection?
c935c4a8-2d93-4c13-9a8e-bec4942d6973|They may be signs of infection.
4cef3e56-b6ed-4d80-8f84-fe104ca68934|But you know that infection I was talking about?
3cb9a8dd-27fb-4e5f-92ed-5dfb1784cd25|Next decision is whether to double down or not.
6a6a32ef-b3a4-42ff-b1e7-b983b70911e3|The guy doubles over once again.
63f2f7ef-721b-4a89-a58d-988e04959be0|I'll wait here in case she doubles back.
4fd2a178-17d2-4925-abec-0db21a306dd2|We'll have to double back and find another way.
7b8630ee-0246-4fa2-8624-0e74269807af|I did it, she froze them.
3a8b8896-5778-40dc-a6d0-53091255cd5d|We freeze her and wait for a boy.
3e9ba3ee-453e-46cd-a903-422bb3cc2092|And hell didn't freeze over?
f1b3f900-0023-4a04-bba0-c9101f82333d|He wants to watch them freeze to death.
2a8a4c67-034b-4580-9cb5-b64ef859f786|It could mean freezing on a park bench.
dec7b3f4-a5d5-4ba1-92ac-7a6db609054a|All portraits were sold to one man.
380b8d78-015a-4b11-a267-403fc9a4e756|I'm sure the portrait was smiling.
a8c389fe-ec48-422f-ba3d-63091dccda97|This portrait that you sent her.
a6a1f766-8b0d-4c9d-97b2-4186b14087ab|Oh, you put the portrait here.
65df247a-d0a1-487e-af1d-fa51db6efac8|But I have no proof.
11012da9-c415-431c-83bd-ad55869ab718|I didn't say it was proof.
d8fbb5a4-c0c5-4111-8932-c692600dcd47|He says he has hard proof and a name.
b1870294-8430-49c4-b788-f225ab292a73|Emily's not going to believe us without proof.
00a24574-e540-499c-9a39-92fa651dc10c|What if I helped you find proof?
198ca2fc-775d-491e-9a4f-4e699863d3c5|You said it was for my insight.
4934c8fd-9dd4-410c-a33f-00abe5119183|It gives a real insight into the child.
54d1e2ee-884b-4003-98ea-80cca09c6cc8|Surely you have some insight.
8a0c903d-d7a8-48cf-8381-9327f2832fa4|You will remain below stairs until you do.
e8b9852b-56be-42d9-8396-79a6e3872562|He'd never go near those stairs before.
74ce561e-7eb9-447b-85f0-bfb6fb9ff430|Couldn't we just have taken the stairs?
d8772df3-c7a3-4150-a8ee-6da10d95d11f|She is gonna come down those stairs, right?
af7458d2-1e0f-4890-965e-c165bb3b96b8|Little thing called a bus crash.
aaed48d4-7251-45bc-b991-6692ed787d01|Now, pull up or we're gonna crash.
630ee896-da29-4868-aca0-72c45c4c5f30|They died in a car crash.
82167a72-19c2-4e81-b6d2-a8c690511fde|Think she's headed for a major crash.
0214a6dd-ff7b-4ed5-bb66-8a8ef75153ed|But that doesn't constitute a criminal offense.
766c7a02-65fc-4529-8191-9548539d7461|We only have thirty minutes to wrap it up.
81c871ed-2ab5-4b61-84a1-3b75cdf0a4b8|More than thirty years ago!
cc952898-8fba-4d89-9170-931a88b2a96f|I have a concert in thirty minutes.
1ba6d513-eed1-48c5-ad84-5e97b8c2681b|She was here about thirty minutes ago.
a614dbaa-3123-450a-9220-af029d07c34b|The program must have been altered!
b8119236-d30f-4ece-9ccc-4098437eb7b0|I shouldn't have altered the past.
e5132ff1-bc64-4c90-9ce6-16bd0c365820|It wouldn't alter my decision.
ceb33881-3c4c-4f89-97a3-b82f23a9516e|Do you know what happens once that is altered?
0fc047ec-0d8e-452c-87b6-19c0f25c47a8|Something came over me, all of a sudden.
653879df-8b5e-491c-ba49-1ca492347f5b|Yes, potentially under a false name.
dce5e7e3-8349-4f6c-a28c-c46f88db9fd1|Until today and then potentially never again.
8f329a0e-eded-4a0f-a479-25fdabe00467|He's not slow, he's gathering potentially new evidence.
20f09f64-bb50-477f-9ccf-23b5a48e08e2|You're such a dirty old man.
9d56fcd4-911b-4436-824d-0c9c24e01536|All this was bought with dirty money.
ef25c782-08c5-487e-b29a-de2b0a855d99|But actually, she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.
0767d0fa-7f43-4819-8179-98ef928ba10f|He even gave me a dirty look.
7517485f-2190-4dfc-88dc-6f4c13e2e99a|They've evolved into higher life forms.
02153e6b-b286-4895-a9e1-033a9d9971ff|The show either has to evolve, or die.
8461ea2b-f81c-4093-8889-cef7b1afda15|How this city continues to evolve.
c44e4322-472e-45a1-8ae2-a93d45e411c0|All of us evolving, changing in this landscape.
4d3d472c-3d96-4dc1-a60e-894e1a0b3bd3|It's no way to raise a teenager, Mary Virginia.
e059da0e-2812-4627-b049-f2572973e690|One I've been doing since I was a teenager.
fe787eec-93b4-42c3-b857-dc86fd241b9b|But I will die filled with joy.
eb147e3a-f641-4119-927f-c317ec0af99d|There had to have been some joy there.
91e47d46-bf71-499e-b82c-b03a19f63c83|I'll never know that joy.
49bb4000-6f41-4fee-967c-4cccd3884084|Do you know the last time I felt joy?
4a1559c3-78b1-4350-bf58-8c752770d598|Seriously, it's been a joy to come to work.
016c03df-0ca2-43fe-a387-e891d579007d|There were smells of four people around the body.
184d5306-9a4c-4350-bc99-9680a3da3f31|My nose knows all the smells in the world.
6a04d26c-9c82-4f9e-9293-18f7ac7854f6|Does it have that new car smell?
487d71cf-560a-4161-8299-bfadd641d759|Well, it doesn't need to possess someone anymore.
1efdeae7-d51b-438e-ab15-024c821bc731|Only for those who yet possess one.
6767beab-17dc-436e-893c-dae1dddfd3ca|It's just a question of possessing the basic skills.
76f36422-4994-4a05-bc48-e2bd8a7f03ee|Have you recovered from hurricane Lucy yet?
a80f04bb-c0f7-4cb7-9f96-370799bf506a|There's nothing out there except a hurricane.
a34fb080-95ae-4485-8352-9c11dad17feb|A hurricane party's exactly what it sounds like.
f93fb280-5181-4771-8e6d-88df164da9c0|You need an atmosphere for a hurricane.
20779a2f-7e6e-46ab-980d-85f9cd19a9b2|No offense, but you're never really any help.
bc29fb5c-6731-45d8-9a59-47f007a69faa|No offense, but, you know, I hate your school.
339099ee-902d-4ffe-bc75-8cb4f65cc8ab|Why are you so relaxed about this?
bc251521-a7b1-4500-a5df-bde53d847bd2|And it's proving difficult to relax.
f9b39f93-8a01-475e-8a7e-70ac01a06806|All right, everyone needs to relax.
6045a75c-7f7c-4fcb-845d-ee45cb662871|I hope they'll appeal to her.
45f008bb-e133-4db1-a927-b243f15e00cb|But I must appeal to his moral sense.
11ed29b9-e246-41ef-b723-2e3948d9df47|I'll appeal, we'll start over.
1d2b8b15-646e-4825-89a2-79e5764541a0|And this case was fully appealed, right?
f7d4fd0f-9c31-4993-92ea-8bafc40b4272|Any mounting or fixing plates, strip it out also.
92e34bea-6ace-4b10-b6c1-0376ad973181|A mounted officer saw them fly by right here.
67ff83b0-898a-4183-a072-815c7d118609|Mounting a defense is still engaging in battle.
57284dd6-aafd-42df-9b7d-3237ec683f7f|We just signed a treaty with Italy.
75c1c957-28fc-498f-aae4-167db00c454c|I'm sure you want to discuss the treaty.
6220bfdb-d2ef-4cd8-946c-a48c4d57b02a|If he wins, then we discuss the treaty.
0c513aa8-d6e2-4491-ba5e-a14488157c78|This treaty happened because he trusted you.
69ae8b2e-823d-4d0a-8e17-2b45848a1c9b|Have you read this treaty?
44bf2fe6-17ad-4beb-b359-0096c7fe4894|He shouldn't be going to that memorial either.
97463a74-eb8a-4604-a2b2-a690fe6e050a|I'm not interested in any memorial.
572c17bf-53c8-4cb0-81a8-17c5e95ea6aa|But you're gonna miss the memorial.
46e83c2e-82f0-4510-a49c-333b0aecbea9|No, hold on, hold on, hold on!
212a5a32-ea0b-4ade-839b-1eb0d4a22c0d|Yes, I'm still on hold.
44c8dcda-7423-433b-b030-4236b475b190|I heard the keys tapping away.
f75105fd-15b1-47cf-9077-289575692496|That fish is still swimming.
03e16047-faa5-4d98-a695-7916082c5b06|You teaching me how to swim.
7e7982d6-64a4-44a4-89f9-23ae4b6b5faf|To swim one day when I was hot.
53c2ed4a-9d6e-4ab1-a33d-2c7ce02dfea5|He must have been swimming in it.
613ad311-ca6f-48af-941c-d6977fa64938|We didn't know how to look properly.
f646e269-55d7-42b9-b7cc-fb1c7d2227b6|Well, I am turning it properly.
0b1c4d22-34ea-49b7-aca6-04ff992fa8ba|He thinks I'm not dressed properly.
964913d5-ea93-4673-97d8-472b41dbae1d|But you treated him properly.
d0f195ee-18a3-4cfa-be62-a67053bab281|There is a gulf between these chairs.
1b7b8310-6ee3-4c1e-a960-00bbf90b6d0e|He believed that the gulf could be crossed.
61961b0f-8830-4ff4-b7b5-5594d06f460c|That rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?
dbc97b08-4d11-42af-a0f7-5d21a68093b9|He said he'd cut my tongue out.
226f57ec-857b-4c5f-9eb4-506d575c9066|My tongue has gone dry.
debee71b-ca7e-460c-ace7-d4c2697cf555|I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat!
ac5d0768-2e8b-4438-8700-49c5ec99d47f|It's called Chinese chicken salad.
fc6491c4-1f14-4d17-aeac-eb8fdff8ce6a|It'd be better with some salad.
6d0a2adf-914b-4ce9-9efe-8053704518c6|I had bad potato salad.
346d1565-1851-4c67-b797-8f35b180c39b|And one very nice salad every day.
c6fcb256-99c8-4333-a8e5-fac2583456a8|We practiced five times, now come on!
7d8ef94b-b9a3-44cb-9f43-1411e69421e0|Would you mind telling us what you are practicing?
6106f3fb-9205-411b-84e5-4c1b20138aa8|No, I'm just practicing my lying.
f77972ee-94da-4c03-891a-7b341db60d39|But I practiced so hard.
d84537f9-f137-43d4-9f2c-e162ec23bf5e|And did you have a favorite?
9bd49af9-d6dd-4841-a9fb-a49d3250c2ff|Actually, my favorite wine is beer.
75dbd54e-93bd-4339-9d15-61e8a7308f6d|But the next room is my personal favorite.
bacb5b49-a375-4c43-b333-bea67ddd1fb2|Maybe volunteer at the women's shelter, go to bed.
419d72e2-cf8c-45d1-ab3a-249763e11d78|Could we at least get him under some shelter?
aeda477f-e21a-409e-ac78-4990e122d9fd|We can give you shelter.
af7f610e-9c39-4678-922a-b503288ed544|He has the prayer card from her funeral.
19f65d52-db22-4cf3-93a6-8514e47b6167|Why wasn't your son at the funeral?
710ff44f-ec55-4a95-9a6c-ad4df2ffad63|She was the editor of the school's literary magazine.
d146a75b-6d5c-4424-941d-d4c556ece4fb|A literary revolution without writing a word.
0daee7aa-196d-46d6-85de-8d25524692b1|They get converted into energy.
26e2e6ca-9de5-4050-b671-0d29c18a2e93|I'll convert his number into a letter.
6bd8ca89-0911-4ef9-bacb-cda41bed5a56|And we convert it into solid fuel.
46a9cb68-2220-40f5-adc2-b2d3eb5c24a8|No, I can convert him, too.
ab71a716-d661-4344-8e09-c57ffb66d263|I will not have anyone to violate my rules.
a07f3325-3ddf-4db9-ab20-d53a945ff0f9|He loves to rub it in.
d6d71a9c-dd8e-4ac3-99f4-e52cff84115b|Only if you rub them.
cf9d2329-e745-4cad-b88e-653b64f82522|She lets me rub up against her leg sometimes.
e44ad370-f1ae-4c9f-b861-eaf5f4c1dff5|That wasn't selling; that was rubbing it in.
fc049a88-586f-4ba0-99e1-26afbd8edcde|Just stay here and watch the entrance.
dfb29baa-3d0e-4b77-a7ef-72922fb042e4|There's no way she'll find the secret entrance.
8dac2b0b-e7ab-42a5-baee-f1eb11d3190f|Look at the circles on this entrance wound.
a1cd3117-a4f1-4f45-aebd-d205d068189f|I want teams on every entrance.
4e077aaf-ca49-4719-ad0a-74a9f55f0b01|I think I saw that episode.
a77a0534-43ba-469c-9a18-64f336d0051e|He hadn't had an episode in six months.
b19fad44-015d-4288-8e3f-62e622f02f25|I give her stupid show three episodes.
9fe0389d-4321-4744-aabc-78c36392ec7e|He's only recently started to discuss these episodes.
cb858231-ead7-4d22-b765-ae77d3f621df|Is that my tournament one?
46be1372-7939-454e-8c96-19f553b022f7|We got the tournament coming up.
02a66774-aaec-46d5-bc2e-389a0b5448af|It's tournament champion or nothing at all.
83d2d0b4-ab77-45f3-9ad2-9e2b032c02ac|Next week is the ladies' league tournament.
92e360f4-112c-49a6-9d12-aee5d4fd89ec|Their vital records have also been declared.
a763f5f7-535c-46e9-8304-7b72a572e62b|These scores are vital to your future.
759d40da-660e-4eb2-8bd6-238ff7fbc79a|I know that he was vital to your plan.
88eb615e-0d7d-4fa2-bc6d-18d276ee8ddb|But trees are vital for life.
c910ff7b-af00-414e-8670-a96013fb56c1|He's not doing so great, but he's stable.
88f8fd48-e54b-4de7-bc34-bce415074039|He was born in a stable.
2f7d76d1-d701-4dcd-a707-3e85707ecef8|There was no stable pattern.
8f00be8a-dc10-4566-ad77-fe38ae592322|I decided I'd rather not split the cut.
cc2cf609-b788-48b7-a580-2a02bf97784c|He split the cost with James.
07e1571d-98c0-4d15-b2fd-1c7156a8a408|We both agreed to split time.
22c31402-9b74-4332-9510-eaa71e4925cc|Or you want to split it with me?
a8165c19-6061-4618-9279-e74efabd1939|Work really must be stressing you out.
c05e4508-c664-4f29-8b50-8d1d46e293ab|We are stressed because we have to win.
6c09be97-9e49-4a25-a02d-e26fce4c6dcd|My blood sugar always gets low when I'm stressed.
07b3c967-2fd0-43c5-a197-276ce894b0b5|Do you want to ask me why I'm stressed?
323046f3-85ee-45e8-9946-5af38fe7e9e8|I don't want you to stress about it.
6fb749db-d541-4a78-8625-b632af86e53b|Things are looking up for you in popular fiction.
5f875c8d-9536-40dd-8f02-0c9af97af2fe|Yeah, is that fact or fiction?
807c5570-67db-4b3c-8d3b-63bbb9711791|We'll get back to the science fiction reading later.
22a8d0e4-d00b-4383-9163-35feda2a4edc|Did you see him get in the lane?
aa9b597a-7bff-49ad-9c96-cf2b6c0537a6|You might wanna get in the right lane.
2d6e16a6-afde-44cb-b7ce-2af46de92a16|We have a problem with my beautiful segment.
47216d41-a1c3-4193-9016-25884044abff|Each segment will become its own ship.
eb486468-26b8-41d3-8c24-8792a86ae261|That segment's gonna get half a million views.
8af0daf5-a350-4d23-8d23-4c0c2c8e6e9f|Gonna transfer gas from that tank to this one.
7ecb8edf-f382-4862-8914-767b52d8008f|I put in for transfer, sir.
3c02573f-8281-47ff-bda5-663db6354c4b|Do you remember anything about his transfer?
edd303ff-7612-49da-9833-65cde4012b07|Should have put in for a transfer.
34e1dd8c-6ebe-4d9c-8c9f-a9ee345f8236|I'm feeling great and confident.
5aec76c8-f7b9-49d4-8d30-d72c3a1a5cff|And I'm confident they will be more than enough.
9d0d08b3-f97e-48ac-8d5c-20227cf63fa0|How confident are they they'll make it?
6748690d-58c9-4b3b-b57f-6626ff1ed948|That's because you made him more confident.
d6a43305-0727-463a-8a76-3dfc844d5d28|It was hard, but it has gotten easier.
f8c4c56f-7872-4bcd-b773-f7f409691a79|Maybe a picture's easier for her to send.
820d4aaf-9fb3-48c1-a9be-0f52c8120771|You know, it's just easier this way.
e698a632-8dec-4421-8166-8b48bae04815|The big shots, but also less prominent players.
ab145c36-51ce-413a-a12d-fee939d776ab|But will he have a prominent position?
e1f54b16-996d-4c64-90f5-cf05a7078ec9|I don't need a safety net.
de2a73a7-0760-4af1-a247-5599b263c5f8|I decided to go with black for the net.
5cd0e473-53c4-4c28-aac2-6e9956d4701c|He's got the ball in the net!
d9454ed3-b446-4e28-b7b6-840723dd04d1|Yes, Chuck, but then there's no safety net.
ac200998-885b-4f91-b141-4bc7009262b8|I want five men on that net.
5dfbdcfd-7e51-4e06-ba95-3a8914e38224|She's still squeezing everyone here to bring you in.
e3e7951f-a70e-4ba4-8410-42c1cf2a3d5d|I'm squeezing it so hard.
5b7ffbfd-a2d4-4587-8e07-bb90af74fdb4|Are you still squeeze that after five years?
16b6d5e2-2cf1-41a3-bbdc-59ae4d6febe7|Who would buy tobacco now?
60198e55-e785-44e9-967f-2d2e0dc7dbee|You can just burn it, like tobacco.
fee75552-ed93-4847-b43f-1fc0a4271084|I had tobacco in my sights.
7434c7ef-5c95-47d0-8420-10b45240cff9|I love alcohol, women, my car, tobacco, and literature!
0eea50fc-0994-4182-a747-1f7b4a1746dd|I can't even steal his tobacco.
dbcb01d3-5e7d-43bb-90ae-3ce15910ecce|I was pretending there too.
c485ecad-a157-49cf-bf6e-736a0aa26729|Pretended not to be, but she is.
8ed6c4e6-5ee5-4cce-917d-9c51bc531407|Just pretending like nothing's happened.
71d0baa3-ba2a-40ec-ad4f-292d958da6c1|Or, if you have anything else, just call mere.
34f7d26e-165c-4837-af7a-6271f0bbc091|It will be installed mere days from now.
8eb7f854-a87e-496a-94ff-a90e751ca2f9|To force himself back into the mix.
95317f32-0e20-4a95-8ffd-68c3e21c7739|Throw this code business into the mix.
fb4f60a8-9de6-4fd3-a723-469f44a756e9|You think there's been a mix up?
9f22bc87-7533-4c6f-96ed-11f326529610|Just drop her into the mix.
566c2a00-fb07-4771-b88c-18fe8af5ffad|It's probably why they got spotted.
e6ddc338-bce3-4510-8697-48b3db00962f|I told you I spotted him three times.
8559696d-ae66-4dc0-b67b-b0a830131681|You know what's gonna happen when Victoria spots you?
15a00fb7-4d98-442f-a437-9f2499735c60|Wouldn't you have spotted it before?
f352fd92-91c5-4d4b-b88b-8dfeed9d7419|He hasn't been spotted since.
1c5a7423-8b4e-456d-8bfc-db5f581f02be|You fade with each day.
3e0dfecb-a48b-43ca-98ba-f3dee7f090ea|I mean he's really faded for me too.
31f47192-8e93-4af0-aec5-101fb7a55ab6|When did my beauty start to fade?
ab5457d4-09ca-46ec-8516-a80e61c5f098|It's just I'm fading fast.
a0136cd9-3221-454b-ab1d-4036d0c49622|They left us, but their hope never faded.
4283f3c5-0b9b-4228-8225-ba01fb498de6|He thought I was the solid steady one.
4ee9b1a3-13b4-4c15-a4ca-05dcb53f56b4|I told her that once we went steady.
b2e4d4d0-1288-425b-8a56-279815bed798|You're gonna apply steady pressure right here.
6adbfd00-c237-48de-b888-b0162c9f88fd|Things that neither of us can ever forget.
0b7461e3-c558-4b23-a85b-209379eac72f|And neither are you, as a matter of fact.
7a8c6d2c-73c5-48e5-8b29-e8936993a881|Well, you can begin by going to Target.
c8e48fcc-17eb-4f41-9d45-2fccf66ca348|Did he target specific people inside of the school?
188a494a-1243-46f4-8628-cf637112266c|Somebody on that plane was targeted.
78549406-8bbc-4098-b71c-8469ce15416e|He was targeted and brought in as a mark.
6276642c-77ca-4dd6-bbc6-571cffccc69b|I mean, it was kind of out of nowhere.
0505df51-4cb9-4797-91dd-43216fdd8e11|You ain't taking my kids nowhere!
5c0128f4-5e94-486f-8ba9-90343d1971dc|I'm nowhere near as stupid as they are.
bbe4c82b-55e2-4776-b62b-1d8caa077276|And this plot is a variation on that theme.
df0b8458-630b-4185-a899-068158c62d36|Yeah, my daughter's working on a variation of that.
48a7595c-d8c3-484e-b30d-34def83aa09c|Well, it must be pretty radical.
b10ebd46-07a4-4f01-9f75-ed88184b2b05|I hear you're something of a radical down there.
a061a7fb-5f11-4c1d-b39a-f3afd200a1a9|You do have what it takes to be radical.
e324957c-d222-4d1a-a6bc-0fc76ba63a71|Such radical matters must be spoken in secret.
5d793828-74b7-415a-8a52-2af1382c24ae|Can't we just have a normal adventure?
32e0f33c-76e3-4db6-a653-512ab4a12553|There will always be more adventures for another day.
775fbc92-7a28-4663-a452-d4b95f0623c1|I mean, can you imagine the adventures we'd have?
d1046f22-806f-46e3-aa33-78af5f96aac1|I could've been your greatest adventure.
70879569-da8b-4b60-a205-7e722ba41d08|Everything was ahead of us, all our adventures.
c4e9b378-3acb-41f1-ac84-523161975001|I've given you your profession.
9a99054d-18e6-42ac-a2b1-7ab022fc5159|That's what our profession is like.
5519e8cb-2f0f-4eb8-aa58-9d2d1b0ecef3|I at least have a profession.
29e6b80b-d5a7-4c42-8236-6596b76703dd|It's good to have more than one profession.
963aebba-2942-4bbc-a9fa-e01ff94871c2|Sounds more exciting than here.
3fc0a878-01af-473c-92eb-f0523150ff9c|All right, nothing too exciting.
0be82db4-55f6-44ba-afdc-b8f6e0e33a2b|It was such an exciting game.
e72bda5f-4c10-4630-80d4-25a4ee840b23|Still won't get you anywhere exciting.
6671733b-b454-4e65-b205-73c91d75d57b|I'm exciting to be around, what can I say?
d5d6aa5f-b62a-4bce-a3e6-c229db9240b1|Exciting new things are happening around here.
0a41aae5-8f46-432f-aadd-216db879bfd5|Is something exciting happening tonight?
1a110eeb-2198-4a36-9be6-69cb0ab32e2e|It's pretty exciting being a big sister, isn't it?
d4006dae-c653-4afa-8bfc-4d58b372437a|The man who holds my fate in his hands.
17278ebc-38df-4169-96d6-7f6fc334bd4e|Because your fate is in my hands.
bc8622c6-4e1d-41bd-9bdb-1e927dac9488|It is both judgment and fate.
c56aff15-57eb-4c5e-9c8b-262f449e2131|Which, as fate would have it, so am I.
5ead0a76-dd56-47f7-a777-1a7582989fa9|I don't believe that we are victims of fate.
247431dd-9cda-4988-9000-a59a5fac4ac2|Regardless, I think it's time to talk to him.
2865b942-86a2-4634-b49e-892c2c27aa0f|Let's just throw them at her regardless.
daf4d937-a8e6-48a8-8f79-0e756398830e|She had no idea the gun was loaded.
b1df31e2-a2cd-4d99-ae6c-81f6d8b9f847|You get that I'm loaded, right?
0a9721e0-979c-4c35-a2c0-0d68f9267c1e|We load up and protect ourselves in here.
25189913-565b-4d21-bf60-3cb03b4cc94b|Only I'm not high or loaded.
26093173-fab1-4e84-8145-79ebbfb60ecc|How good a singer is he then?
9c8552b7-d5eb-40bd-9f67-d50e644ce88c|I didn't say you were a good singer.
66ee8dcb-c72f-4b45-b375-a3c126a23924|She had eyes only for that singer.
7423e3b0-e407-41af-a365-b56de101ecbe|Maybe you should be the country singer.
7a0da6da-3db4-4326-a198-7383a7b7713e|We sure could use a place to distribute it.
2d8d12c0-59ec-4548-87b5-7934506dd811|This thing must be two tons, easy.
970d7259-371a-4986-b1f7-4fefb6c8a423|Well, I hope they bring back tons of food.
3a8a67c5-6087-418f-8d72-fa26791fdb49|No, no, I got eight tons of change.
dbc204f1-9dbd-487f-ae7a-0a17587658c4|Take my son, for instance.
5e2cd08d-0396-49ba-8306-8bcb3ed7fadb|It is in this instance.
6a887f9e-662e-4cf8-a23d-98afdbe153c1|For instance, he takes a break during the show.
267b0f55-b464-47a3-b29d-6d57b6488fc2|What do you know about hunting?
d6df51f3-23d9-437f-b714-e3eca2aba15b|Anybody see you as you're going hunting?
bbef79a8-3d5a-494f-9630-55f3d3561fb1|We are now in their hunting area.
a9608c5c-e02d-45a4-bff1-e5cde3042a2e|He may also have applied for hunting licenses.
6aea6212-2440-4e30-afd0-937d61014daa|He could be hunting me right now.
59e51d69-35a1-4e2b-95bd-49f2cc0ec677|It's not hunting if you pay for it.
8510f3d7-38c3-4e9a-9926-d3f3264d55ba|They were armed men hunting us down.
257c9389-c3e6-41db-8c17-250ca704addb|This whole race with George, hunting for a husband?
69519349-3b08-4c4f-8fa0-40d1dd40c446|Oh, I'm just hunting ideas.
b4cc21c6-a718-45e9-8432-bd6963c431ae|It makes me all pale and washed out.
a7c90592-7e66-45b3-88bd-d1132dd24c99|Why was your face so pale just now?
dabb41bd-691e-47fe-a95a-1a44cf315234|You are pale and green.
6b5f837e-f2bd-4486-a8aa-6f03fee65427|You wore a pale green dress.
e5f406eb-e514-4dc9-b329-1a4a440f19c4|But you look very pale.
947cbaaa-41d0-4e8d-9db0-58d24ed70cff|Get us two regular bears, black paint, white paint.
ee0b7546-b917-47c9-ab71-4aedad7c6747|Paint it any color you want.
94ecbd6f-59cb-4cbf-addf-073c4a4b7d92|What color is the paint in her bathroom?
c66fbc0e-f5a5-4508-bb28-ad52a3c99126|What's it like to be a poet?
496b60b2-fa7a-4f4e-9d02-15185ca6f680|Is that the only poet you know?
591147d1-974f-4cc3-a92c-455fd9c7b1d1|You have to be like a poet.
5528093d-3ea6-4526-bf9a-f9466f7e6175|What you do is you gradually feed it.
d0f8c6f5-6b68-442e-a024-422f109f5e1a|Let her get used to the idea gradually.
b1daf9fa-0425-4283-b1c5-651aca7fa039|We'll bring him out gradually.
f2df0b7b-d4bc-4f0d-9d88-c01ae01d1c6c|I've been increasing the temperature gradually.
527a2354-afa6-4e04-af73-907ba6aabb85|It came on kind of gradually.
62543c24-32f5-4e5f-b95b-6b0347e415ff|I'm not familiar with Canadian ranks.
1101fa88-57d3-4b48-b824-e5df8502d438|I hope you enjoy being a Canadian citizen.
082513f5-0047-4e02-9f80-67b04cef0d61|I think she was headed toward the Canadian border.
53b847a4-7018-4c12-851e-a1abb3b7c39c|This is the greatest victory in Canadian history.
47e110ff-fc73-431d-8ff5-5a38a0ccf33e|Should I get the evidence tech out here?
ce3dbd4d-f108-4e24-9aeb-fa66b62e3012|I heard the lab tech say it.
1b01c20e-320d-4953-8b9d-0682af214f04|Oh, yeah, the tech guy, right?
1aeba3f9-bb65-487f-94ed-0b2ec25a8b0b|Glasses look like they're made of the same tech.
2eb2efe3-6b47-495d-8bd5-47c2b60e2f4d|They could be members of the chamber of commerce.
77edf563-9fdb-4eb3-9407-e00cdc5767c2|With him there was no commerce possible.
31804627-4ebe-40cf-9975-41d1db5ec420|Anyway, we get pretty baked.
01238eec-33d2-47d0-8e2d-d40ef69e2aaf|Leo, you didn't have to bake a cake!
11ee6994-26c1-40cc-b398-1b1f4353629a|I baked a cake for my friends.
9dddbd3a-4bd4-47b6-a561-cde6fe9049ad|I think they've been baking all morning.
5c8afa28-2b41-4977-9472-3dc62772710c|I got totally baked off of it this morning.
fb77fd4d-a098-4726-aee8-516ec41a2821|You want shelf space, am I right?
4510ef9a-8e76-4386-a20a-75041e14d684|She tried to grab the shelf, break her fall.
378b371b-ee38-4274-bed5-acb3369cb1fa|How long am I on the shelf?
56875e18-cfad-41e9-9c11-83908999ae97|Now I can put up that shelf.
2002c113-855f-4f1c-9a8e-3165a43cf84d|I keep it on a shelf over my desk.
f6e56dfb-2607-4bc3-ba9c-19f56946c122|I don't want to sit down, honey.
9c817f82-e10b-4384-a0f2-973c0e6aafe7|And you like me, don't you, honey?
26824dda-8b12-48de-ba4c-48c758873a18|We should be going, honey.
a44556b0-af3f-4d93-a2f1-2485653174d4|We got lots of money, honey.
d89c3b0a-ea85-4e37-b5cc-1e2ad0e32111|You just watch your blood pressure, honey.
0574f442-251e-4a0d-a07b-e792617a7ffe|And that is round one.
4df63838-ec06-47de-bedc-13949b0e5fad|I'm sure you'll emerge a more rounded person.
c3196d78-2b67-4ae3-a2c0-44a4bc3dcfd8|My little round friends too.
66bd195b-452f-4036-8bfa-f1e771f91617|We start the storm heard 'round the world?
3c2fb6f0-d61d-4a99-9f9a-79916c3de477|Right, let's all gather round, shall we?
c051df43-de48-4b3c-a4fb-73a3f5534e42|All right, it's my round.
937f091f-907f-4c28-81e9-dfd22bf8f3de|She's going round the other side!
a91ecec1-24c5-4c97-968b-903172e3e61e|It's the same guy who fled the murder scene.
14f9da43-4190-4254-be18-1113c207a160|They assumed he knew where she fled.
becc70bf-6675-449b-a10a-d8bafae66077|He fled after the other two were killed.
0d8d321b-ea75-489f-aae9-46aaa24f0b0b|People who fled with what they could.
79c9c59f-ba2f-42e3-9128-98f1fdab4b34|That's something I could never adapt to.
54f078f9-584b-4595-83e7-64296b786bcb|Give yourself five minutes to adapt, my brother.
aac6e6b7-5aff-4e34-93fe-34edb6ba489a|They did say something about a new buyer.
9846d2fb-7bb9-4998-8652-3dd86b6abd9d|I found the perfect buyer for this place.
b18d4a22-bbff-4a28-a3b8-f4fa1f8dc013|Buyer's all set up just like we planned.
e13556f8-647f-405c-9520-58ff57a5f381|Has he got a divorce lawyer, all of that?
a99b8cfe-33ef-453a-8cd0-5318b09875e0|I mean, who cares if they get a divorce?
d5fb0a6a-bb58-4aa1-9dbf-3242ddc7000c|I thought Walter was handling the divorce for Bill.
14511b71-22b9-4f46-919f-d9529eb72f3d|I didn't think I was being defensive.
5df7be22-0ea8-48d3-96e9-afe6312f7f32|And take up defensive positions.
c19005b2-135d-4eeb-9e8a-a2fedf593f4b|Well, at least you're not defensive about it.
fd8aff3e-1d2c-49cd-905b-abf91dcbf070|They're taking defensive positions, preparing for an attack.
ca89db46-4d44-420e-b7df-2ea496badc05|Why were you bombing it?
a21da49d-d353-44da-b3ff-9c9e2ece7272|What are they, bombing us?
e063867d-68c8-4104-af6c-cd3c50b0dc18|What if they were really bombing us?
f7b38a77-b995-4bcf-a996-91a95b1296f9|We begin bombing in five minutes.
28693b62-cedb-4385-b94d-a8932a5c99ed|We were hot and scared.
f7e0eab0-ba67-4844-bc93-f77da6ef2565|I didn't feel so scared anymore.
0540359f-3e56-4df6-bb76-b3f244fc796e|Well I'm a little bit scared.
d434217d-340f-4502-8cfc-e1241ce151be|What are you so scared of?
ec9e0120-0ded-49eb-89f7-8ff0260f5b79|Scared of falling in love with you.
1e7a9e2c-1f7d-4be7-afd6-53c70186c78b|Leave it for now, he's scared.
360784ef-4eaf-4faa-b595-bd1151504069|I'm scared of what he's going to do.
26810e90-e440-4e34-92f2-106bbb7c508f|I'm scared I'm losing my mind!
7ea2bd5b-9fc3-440a-a985-bf20946c1a34|That thing was supposed to make you less scared?
6292a9f1-e699-49d2-8a80-04d442c73ffe|Okay, it scared the hell out of me.
6b081783-0767-4eb6-8b04-b3709108eecd|Rebecca, listen, you are at the grand gesture moment.
df617ab4-3a2a-4ed3-998b-d3ae2918c3a4|Maybe this is just a nice gesture?
20171e03-9178-4ca8-8d0a-c67eb4b46faa|That's, like, the grandest grand gesture ever.
47eb6731-00b0-48cd-aa55-d4a5954aa285|I saw that hand gesture.
d5773780-381a-4abd-bb29-bebd5b87185d|You really should write poetry.
a697b12d-91b1-4329-8d8f-53059ee2e31c|You've taken some of the poetry out of it.
74e28eaf-ab99-469e-a41f-f755b88a43a9|What's poetry got to do with it?
c69478e1-7332-4951-9937-e376977dfea3|We've been waiting on that reserve money all day.
51996c16-4c2b-4e94-bb5d-fec344dfd3ec|Cash reserves, how much do we have?
63637305-c478-4ff3-8e1d-9dc080f9dc88|And this here is the reserve!
97194e4c-4257-496c-89e2-3d21536fe245|We don't have that kind of reserve.
8c39a49e-0247-4f8b-94f3-310c60da6ad6|Nothing I say will satisfy you.
79178991-aaf9-43e1-a33a-c926bd4c2552|I have needs that he didn't satisfy.
44fa68e6-05cf-4144-b89a-833b403d3b18|Only young girls could satisfy him.
fa837256-e8bc-4650-b958-a46045c8279a|Yeah, well I'm just satisfied that it's over.
b164bb7c-bf29-4214-aff4-6ebacefd3092|I hope you're satisfied with me.
ae26fa23-023e-4483-987a-b84a8d2adb68|You reported your company for causing pollution.
6da437ed-6c20-4aef-a303-ad34886f7b1e|A new, unique material that helps reduce pollution.
d617362c-bfad-4bb6-bbbd-bb1d1e319197|Maybe it's pollution or smoke or something.
912bece4-3249-4602-81ac-e74d30585207|The dangers of noise pollution are real.
9121d2ba-b8ba-4e8e-bbfd-8dfc60646649|I wanna put this cool sign on your lawn.
a8e60faf-3365-405a-9ccf-0d99993778de|Get off my lawn, now!
33057853-b2a5-4727-a472-df2beb48520b|You make me old with wisdom.
19491e2e-8eaf-4572-86f0-897751feae5e|I've been taking care of the tree ever since.
c56b23fb-3e2c-4751-86ba-a65ebacade49|Was already here, or brought in since.
ebae817b-cc97-4344-a0cd-8acdce0fa542|They haven't caught him since.
afea3721-86ae-41ec-8f5b-9d3e7c4e09a3|He claims he hasn't seen her since.
b8be1f4b-50e9-4013-9b98-55c92824edeb|I since learned that she's not even gay.
1a547587-6795-4f0d-960b-d5761cd90b5e|It must be a great comfort to you.
4bf0d427-138e-48fb-9de4-84f873d71f32|That's a bit close for comfort.
2d625430-f7e6-4efd-84f9-31b0daab483d|That's a little outside my comfort zone.
88eabe94-33cd-4f7f-be80-c48dc57b6aa7|You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick.
53c318f3-d9dc-475f-b599-8867a87b47b8|And plot the speed and heading of these things.
d1f76b49-6d1b-41ab-95f6-7cd14ea472a2|All the plots are about trying to kill you.
6d13deaf-9259-487d-95d5-242d7bfc0ce6|He bought this plot when I was four.
4ff234da-c051-4262-9515-8590c5a91cbe|After that, he went completely mental, lost the plot.
fa174452-7d60-4492-acd1-268a28d5b9ee|So much for your grand plot, asshole!
