# Storm Front by Jim Butcher
# Chapter One
I heard the postman approach my office door, half an hour earlier than usual. He didn’t sound right. His footsteps fell more heavily, cheerfully, and he whistled. A new guy. He whistled his way to my office door, then fell silent for a moment. Then he laughed.
Then he knocked.
I winced. My mail comes through the mail slot unless it’s registered. I get a really limited selection of registered mail, and it’s never good news. I got up out of my office chair and opened the door.
The new postman, who looked like a basketball with arms and legs and a reddened, thinning head, was chuckling at the sign on the door glass. He glanced at me and hooked a thumb toward the sign. “You’re kidding, right?”
I read the sign (people change it occasionally), and shook my head. “No, I’m serious. Can I have my mail, please?”
“So, uh. Like parties, shows, stuff like that?” He looked past me, as though he expected to see a white tiger, or possibly some scantily clad assistants strutting around my one-room office.
I sighed, not in the mood to get mocked again, and reached for the mail he held in his hand. “No, not like that. I don’t do parties.”
He held on to it, his head tilted curiously. “So what? Some kinda fortune-teller? Cards and crystal balls and things?”
“No,” I told him. “I’m not a fortune-teller.” I tugged at the mail.
He held on to it. “What are you, then?”
“What’s the sign on the door say?”
“It says ‘Harry Dresden. Magician.’”
“That’s me,” I confirmed.
“An actual magician?” he asked, grinning, as though I should let him in on the joke. “Spells and potions? Demons and incantations? Subtle and quick to anger?”
“Not so subtle.” I jerked the mail out of his hand and looked pointedly at his pad. “Can I sign for my mail please?”
The new postman’s grin vanished, replaced with a frown. He passed over the pad to let me sign for the mail (another late notice from my landlord), and said, “You’re a nut. That’s what you are.” He took his pad back, and said, “You have a nice day, sir.”
I watched him go.
“Typical,” I muttered, and shut the door.
My name is Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden. Conjure by it at your own risk. I’m a magician. I work out of an office in central Chicago. As far as I know, I’m the only openly practicing professional magician in the country. You can find me in the yellow pages, under “Magicians.” Believe it or not, I’m the only one there. My ad looks like this:
HARRY DRESDEN—MAGICIAN
LOST ITEMS FOUND. SUPERNATURAL INVESTIGATIONS.
CONSULTING. ADVICE. REASONABLE RATES.
NO LOVE POTIONS, ENDLESS PURSES, PARTIES,
OR OTHER ENTERTAINMENT.
You’d be surprised how many people call just to ask me if I’m serious. But then, if you’d seen the things I’d seen, if you knew half of what I knew, you’d wonder how anyone could not think I was serious.
The end of the twentieth century and the dawn of the new millennium had seen something of a revival in the public awareness of the supernatural. Fortune-tellers, haunts, vampires—you name it. People still didn’t take them seriously, but all the things Science had promised us hadn’t come to pass. Disease was still a problem. Hunger was still a problem. Violence and crime and war were still problems. In spite of the advance of technology, things just hadn’t changed the way everyone had hoped and thought they would.
Science, the largest religion of the twentieth century, had become somewhat damaged by images of exploding space shuttles, crack babies, and a generation of self-satisfied Americans who had allowed the television to raise their children. People were looking for something—I think they just didn’t know what. And even though they were once again starting to open their eyes to the world of magic and the mysterious that had been with them all the while, they still thought I must be some kind of joke.
Anyway, it had been a slow month. A slow pair of months, actually. My rent from February didn’t get paid until the tenth of March, and it was looking like it might be even longer until I got caught up for this month.
My only job had been the previous week, when I’d gone down to Branson, Missouri, to investigate a country singer’s possibly haunted house. It hadn’t been. My client hadn’t been happy with that answer, and had been even less happy when I suggested he lay off of any mind-altering substances and try to get some exercise and sleep, and see if that didn’t help things more than a ritual. I’d gotten travel expenses plus an hour’s pay, and gone away feeling I had done the honest, righteous, and unrealistic thing. I heard later that he’d hired a charlatan psychic to come in and perform a ceremony with a lot of fragrant smoke and black lights. Some people.
I finished up my paperback and tossed it into the DONE box. There was a pile of read and discarded paperbacks in a thick paper box on one side of my desk, the spines curved and the pages damaged. I’m terribly hard on books. I was eyeing the pile of unopened books, considering which to start next, given that I had no real work to do, when my phone rang.
I stared at it in a somewhat surly fashion. We magicians are terrific at mulling. After the third ring, when I thought I wouldn’t sound a little too eager, I picked up the receiver and said, “Dresden.”
“Oh. Is this, um, Harry Dresden? The, ah, magician?” Her tone was sorry, as though she were terribly afraid she would be insulting me.
No, I thought. It’s Harry Dresden the, ah, lizard. Harry the magician is one door down.
It is the right of magicians to be grouchy. It is not, however, the right of independent consultants who are late on their rent, so instead of saying something smart, I told the woman on the phone, “Yes, ma’am. How can I help you today?”
“I, um,” she said. “I’m not sure. I’ve lost something, and I think maybe you could help me.”
“Finding lost articles is a specialty,” I said. “What would I be looking for?”
There was a nervous pause. “My husband,” she said. She had a voice that was a little raspy, like that of a pep squad member who’d been working a long tournament, but had enough weight of years in it to place her as an adult.
My eyebrows went up. “Ma’am, I’m not really a missing-persons specialist. Have you contacted the police or a private investigator?”
“No,” she said, quickly. “No, they can’t. That is, I haven’t. Oh dear, this is all so complicated. Not something someone can talk about on the phone. I’m sorry to have taken up your time, Mr. Dresden.”
“Hold on now,” I said quickly. “I’m sorry, you didn’t tell me your name.”
There was that nervous pause again, as though she were checking a sheet of written notes before answering. “Call me Monica.”
People who know nothing about magicians don’t like to give us their names. They’re convinced that if they give a magician their name from their own lips it could be used against them. To be fair, they’re right.
I had to be as polite and harmless as I could. She was about to hang up out of pure hesitation, and I needed the job. I could probably turn husband up, if I worked at it.
“Okay, Monica,” I told her, trying to sound as melodious and friendly as I could. “If you feel your situation is of a sensitive nature, maybe you could come by my office and talk about it. If it turns out that I can help you best, I will, and if not, then I can direct you to someone I think can help you better.” I clenched my teeth and pretended I was smiling. “No charge.”
It must have been the no charge that did it. She agreed to come right out to the office, and told me that she would be there in an hour. That put her estimated arrival at about two-thirty. Plenty of time to go out and get some lunch, then get back to the office to meet her.
The phone rang again almost the instant I put it down, making me jump. I peered at it. I don’t trust electronics. Anything manufactured after the forties is suspect—and doesn’t seem to have much liking for me. You name it: cars, radios, telephones, TVs, video players—none of them seem to behave well for me. I don’t even like to use automatic pencils.
I answered the phone with the same false cheer I had summoned up for Monica Husband-Missing. “This is Dresden, may I help you?”
“Harry, I need you at the Madison in the next ten minutes. Can you be there?” The voice on the other end of the line was also a woman’s, cool, quick, professional.
“Why, Lieutenant Murphy,” I exclaimed, filled with sweetness, “it’s good to hear from you, too. It’s been so long. Oh, they’re fine, fine. And your family?”
“Save it, Harry. I’ve got a couple of bodies here, and I need you to take a look around.”
I calmed immediately. Karrin Murphy was the director of Special Investigations out of downtown Chicago, a de facto appointee of the Police Commissioner to investigate any crimes dubbed unusual. Vampire attacks, monster raids, and fairy kidnappings of children didn’t fit in very neatly on a police report—but at the same time, people got attacked, infants got stolen, property was damaged or destroyed. And someone had to look into it.
In Chicago, or pretty much anywhere in Chicagoland, that person was Karrin Murphy. I was her library of the supernatural on legs, and a paid consultant for the police department. But two bodies? Two deaths by means unknown? I hadn’t handled anything like that for her before.
“Where are you?” I asked her.
“Madison Hotel on Tenth, seventh floor.”
“That’s only a fifteen-minute walk from my office,” I said.
“So you can be here in fifteen minutes. Good.”
“Um,” I said. I looked at the clock. Monica No-Last-Name would be here in a little more than forty-five minutes. “I’ve sort of got an appointment.”
“Dresden, I’ve sort of got a pair of corpses with no leads and no suspects, and a killer walking around loose. Your appointment can wait.”
My temper flared. It does that occasionally. “It can’t, actually,” I said. “But I’ll tell you what. I’ll walk on over and take a look around, and be back here in time for it.”
“Have you had lunch yet?” she asked.
“What?”
She repeated the question.
“No,” I said.
“Don’t.” There was a pause, and when she spoke again, there was a sort of greenish tone to her words. “It’s bad.”
“How bad are we talking here, Murph?”
Her voice softened, and that scared me more than any images of blood or violent death could have. Murphy was the original tough girl, and she prided herself on never showing weakness. “It’s bad, Harry. Please don’t take too long. Special Crimes is eager to get their fingers on this one, and I know you don’t like people to touch the scene before you can look around.”
“I’m on the way,” I told her, already standing and pulling on my jacket.
“Seventh floor,” she reminded me. “See you there.”
“Okay.”
I turned off the lights to my office, went out the door, and locked up behind me, frowning. I wasn’t sure how long it was going to take to investigate Murphy’s scene, and I didn’t want to miss out on speaking with Monica Ask-Me-No-Questions. So I opened the door again, got out a piece of paper and a pin, and wrote:
Out briefly. Back for appointment at 2:30. Dresden
That done, I started down the stairs. I rarely use the elevator, even though I’m on the fifth floor. Like I said, I don’t trust machines. They’re always breaking down on me just when I need them.
Besides which. If I were someone in this town using magic to kill people two at a time, and I didn’t want to get caught, I’d make sure that I removed the only practicing mage the police department kept on retainer. I liked my odds on the stairs a lot better than I did in the small confines of the elevator.
Paranoid? Probably. But just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean that there isn’t an invisible demon about to eat your face.
# Chapter Two
Karrin Murphy was waiting for me outside the Madison. Karrin and I are a study in contrasts. Where I am tall and lean, she’s short and husky. Where I have dark hair and dark eyes, she’s got Shirley Temple blond locks and baby blues. Where my features are all lean and bony, with a hooked nose and a sharp chin, hers are round and smooth, with the kind of cute nose you’d expect on a girl.
It was cool and breezy, like it usually is in March, and she wore a long coat that covered her suit. Murphy never wore dresses, though I suspected she’d have muscular, well-shaped legs, like an athlete. She was built for function, and had a pair of trophies in her office from martial art tournaments to prove it. Her hair was cut at shoulder length and whipped out wildly in the spring wind. She wasn’t wearing earrings, and her makeup was of sufficient quality and quantity that it was tough to tell she had on any at all. She looked more like a favorite aunt or a cheerful mother than a hard-bitten homicide detective.
“Don’t you have any other jackets, Dresden?” she asked, as I came within hailing distance. There were several police cars parked illegally in front of the building. She glanced at my eyes for a half second and then away, quickly. I had to give her credit. It was more than most people did. It wasn’t really dangerous unless you did it for several seconds, but I was used to anyone who knew I was a magician making it a point not to glance at my face.
I looked down at my black canvas duster, with its heavy covering and water-resistant lining and sleeves actually long enough for my arms. “What’s wrong with this one?”
“It belongs on the set of El Dorado.”
“And?”
She snorted, a rude sound from so small a woman, and spun on her heel to walk toward the hotel’s front doors.
I caught up and walked a little ahead of her.
She sped her pace. So did I. We raced one another toward the front door, with increasing speed, through the pools left over from last night’s rain.
My legs were longer; I got there first. I opened the door for her and politely gestured for her to go in. It was an old contest of ours. Maybe my values are old-fashioned, but I come from an old school of thought. I think that men ought to treat women like something other than just shorter, weaker men with breasts. Try and convict me if I’m a bad person for thinking so. I enjoy treating a woman like a lady, opening doors for her, paying for shared meals, giving flowers—all that sort of thing.
It irritates the hell out of Murphy, who had to fight and claw and play dirty with the toughest men in Chicago to get as far as she has. She glared up at me while I stood there holding open the door, but there was a reassurance about the glare, a relaxation. She took an odd sort of comfort in our ritual, annoying as she usually found it.
How bad was it up on the seventh floor, anyway?
We rode the elevator in a sudden silence. We knew one another well enough, by this time, that the silences were not uncomfortable. I had a good sense of Murphy, an instinctual grasp for her moods and patterns of thought—something I develop whenever I’m around someone for any length of time. Whether it’s a natural talent or a supernatural one I don’t know.
My instincts told me that Murphy was tense, stretched as tight as piano wire. She kept it off her face, but there was something about the set of her shoulders and neck, the stiffness of her back, that made me aware of it.
Or maybe I was just projecting it onto her. The confines of the elevator made me a bit nervous. I licked my lips and looked around the interior of the car. My shadow and Murphy’s fell on the floor, and almost looked as though they were spread there. There was something about it that bothered me, a persistent little instinct that I blew off as a case of nerves. Steady, Harry.
She let out a harsh breath just as the elevator slowed, then sucked in another one before the doors could open, as though she were planning on holding it for as long as we were on the floor and breathing only when she got back in the elevator again.
Blood smells a certain way, a kind of sticky, almost metallic odor, and the air was full of it when the elevator doors opened. My stomach lurched a little bit, but I swallowed manfully and followed Murphy out of the elevator and down the hall past a couple of uniform cops, who recognized me and waved me past without asking to see the little plastic-coated card the city had given me. Granted, even in a big-city department like Chicago P.D., they didn’t exactly call in a crowd of consultants (I went down in the paperwork as a psychic consultant, I think), but still. Inappropriate of the boys in blue.
Murphy preceded me into the room. The smell of blood grew thicker, but there wasn’t anything horrific behind door number one. The outer room of the suite looked like some kind of a sitting room done in rich tones of red and gold, like a set from an old movie in the thirties—expensive-looking, but somehow fake, nonetheless. Dark, rich leather covered the chairs, and my feet sank into the thick, reddish-brown pile of the carpet. The velvet plush curtains had been drawn, and though the lights were all on, the place still seemed a little too dark, a little too sensual in its textures and colors. It wasn’t the kind of room where you sit and read a book. Voices came from a doorway to my right.
“Wait here a minute,” Murphy told me. Then she went through the door to the right of the entrance and into what I supposed was the bedroom of the suite.
I wandered around the sitting room with my eyes mostly closed, noting things. Leather couch. Two leather chairs. Stereo and television in a black glossy entertainment center. Champagne bottle warming in a stand holding a full tub of what had been ice the night before, with two empty glasses set beside it. There was a red rose petal on the floor, not matching with the carpeting (but then, in that room, what didn’t?).
A bit to one side, under the skirt of one of the leather lounge chairs, was a little piece of silky cloth. I bent at the waist and lifted the skirt with one hand, careful not to touch anything. A pair of black silky underwear, a tiny triangle with trim coming off the points, lay there, one strap snapped as though the G-string had simply been torn off. Kinky.
The stereo system was state of the art, though not an expensive brand. I took a pencil from my pocket and pushed the PLAY button with the eraser. Gentle, sensual music filled the room, a low bass, a driving beat, silent vocals, the heavy breathing of a woman as background.
The music continued for a few seconds more, and then it began to skip over a section about two seconds long, repeating it over and over again.
I frowned. Like I said, I have this effect on machinery. It has something to do with being a magician, with working with magical forces. The more delicate and modern the machine is, the more likely it is that something will go wrong if I get close enough to it. I can kill a copier at fifty paces.
“The love suite,” came a man’s voice, drawing the word love out into love. “What do you think, Mister Man?”
“Hello, Detective Carmichael,” I said, without turning around. Carmichael’s rather light, nasal voice had a distinctive quality. He was Murphy’s partner and the resident skeptic, convinced that I was nothing more than a fraud, cheating the city out of its hard-earned money. “Were you saving the underwear to take home yourself, or did you just overlook them?” I turned and looked at him. He was short and overweight and thinning, with small, red eyes and a weak chin. His jacket was wrinkled, and there were food stains on his tie, all of which served to conceal a razor intellect. He was a sharp cop, and absolutely relentless at tracking down killers.
He walked over to the chair and looked down. “Not bad, Sherlock,” he said. “But that’s just the introduction. Wait’ll you see the main attraction. I’ll have a bucket waiting for you.” He turned and killed the broken disc player with a poke from the eraser end of his own pencil.
I widened my eyes at him, to let him know how terrified I was, then walked past him and into the bedroom. And regretted it. I looked, noted details mechanically, and quietly shut the door on the part of my head that had started screaming the second I entered the room.
They must have died sometime the night before, as death stiffness had already set in. They were on the bed; she was straddling him, body leaned back, back bowed like a dancer’s, the curves of her breasts making a lovely outline. He stretched beneath her, a lean and powerfully built man, arms reaching out and grasping at the smooth sheets, gathering them in his fists. Had it been an erotic photograph, it would have made a striking picture.
Except that the lovers’ rib cages on the upper left side of their torsos had expanded outward, through their skin, the ribs poking out like ragged, snapped knives. Arterial blood had sprayed out of their bodies, all the way to the mirror on the ceiling, along with mashed, jelly-like masses of flesh that had to be what remained of their hearts. Standing over them, I could see into the upper cavity of the bodies. I noted the now pale lining around the still left lungs and the edges of the ribs, which apparently were forced outward and snapped by some force within.
It definitely cut down on the erotic potential.
The bed was in the middle of the room, giving it a subtle emphasis. The bedroom followed the decor of the sitting room—a lot of red, a lot of soft fabrics, a little over the top unless viewed in soft light. There were indeed candles in holders on the wall, now burned down to the ends and put out.
I stepped closer to the bed and walked around it. The carpet sloshed as I did. The little screaming part of my brain, safely locked up behind doors of self-control and strict training, continued babbling. I tried to ignore it. Really I did. But if I didn’t get out of that room in a hurry, I was going to start crying like a little girl.
So I took in the details fast. The woman was in her twenties, in fabulous condition. At least I thought she had been. It was hard to tell. She had hair the color of brown, cut in a short cut style, and it seemed colored to me. Her eyes were only partly open, and I couldn’t quite guess at their color beyond not-dark. Vaguely green?
The man was probably in his forties, and had the kind of fitness that comes from a lifetime of conditioning. There was a tattoo on his right upper arm, a winged knife, that the pull of the smooth sheets half concealed. There were scars on his finger joints, layers deep, and across his lower belly was a vicious, narrow, wrinkled scar that I guessed must have come from a knife wound.
There were discarded clothes around—a suit for him, a little cover of a black dress and a pair of pumps for her. There were a pair of overnight bags, sealed and set neatly aside, probably by a porter.
I looked up. Carmichael and Murphy were watching me in silence.
I shrugged at them.
“Well?” Murphy demanded. “Are we dealing with magic here, or aren’t we?”
“Either that or it was really incredible sex,” I told her.
Carmichael snorted.
I laughed a little, too—and that was all the screaming part of my brain needed to slam open the doors I’d shut on it. My stomach churned and heaved, and I stumbled out of the room. Carmichael, true to his word, had set a stainless-steel bucket outside the room, and I fell to my knees throwing up.
It only took me a few seconds to control myself again—but I didn’t want to go back in that room. I didn’t need to see what was there anymore. I didn’t want to see the two dead people, whose hearts had literally exploded out of their chests.
And someone had used magic to do it. They had used magic to inflict harm on another, violating the First Law. The White Council was going to go into collective rage. This hadn’t been the act of an evil spirit or a nasty entity, or the attack of one of the many creatures of the Nevernever, like vampires or monsters. This had been the planned, deliberate act of a magic-user, a mage, a human being able to tap into the fundamental energies of creation and life itself.
It was worse than murder. It was twisted, awful corruption, as though someone had hit another person to death with a Botticelli, turned something of beauty to an act of utter destruction.
If you’ve never touched it, it’s hard to explain. Magic is created by life, and most of all by the awareness, intelligence, emotions of a human being. To end such a life with the same magic that was born from it was hideous, almost unnatural somehow.
I sat up again and was breathing hard, shaking and tasting the bile in my mouth, when Murphy came back out of the room with Carmichael.
“All right, Harry,” Murphy said. “Let’s have it. What do you see happening here?”
I took a moment to collect my thoughts before answering. “They came in. They had some champagne. They danced for a while, made out, over there by the stereo. Then went into the bedroom. They were in there for less than an hour. It hit them when they were getting to the high point.”
“Less than an hour,” Carmichael said. “How do you figure?”
“Compact Disc was only an hour and ten long. Figure a few minutes for dancing and drinking, and then they’re in the room. Was the Compact Disc playing when they found them?”
“No,” Murphy said.
“Then it hadn’t been set on a loop. I figure they wanted music, just to make things perfect, given the room and all.”
Carmichael muttered, sourly. “Nothing we hadn’t already figured out for ourselves,” he said to Murphy. “He’d better come up with more than this.”
Murphy shot Carmichael a look that said “shut up,” then said, softly, “I need more, Harry.”
I ran one of my hands back over my hair. “There’s only two ways anyone could have managed this. The first is by conjuring. Conjuring is the most direct, spectacular, and noisy form of expressed magic, or witchcraft. Explosions, fire, that sort of thing. But I doubt it was a conjurer who did this.”
“Why?” Murphy demanded. I heard her pencil scratching on the notebook she always kept with her.
“Because you have to be able to see or touch where you want your effect to go,” I told her. “Line of sight only. The man or woman would have had to be there in the room with them. Tough to hide forensic evidence with something like that, and anyone who was skilled enough to pull off a spell like that would have had the sense to use a gun instead. It’s easier.”
“What’s the other option?” Murphy asked.
“Thaumaturgy,” I said. “As above, so below. Make something happen on a small scale, and give it the energy to happen on a large scale.”
Carmichael snorted. “What nonsense.”
Murphy’s voice sounded skeptical. “How would that work, Harry? Could it be done from somewhere else?”
I nodded. “The killer would need to have something to connect him or her to the victims. Hair, fingernails, blood samples. That sort of thing.”
“Like a magic doll?”
“Exactly the same thing, yes.”
“There’s fresh color in the woman’s hair,” Murphy said.
I nodded. “Maybe if you can find out where she got her hair styled, you could find something out. I don’t know.”
“Is there anything else you could tell me that would be of use?”
“Yes. The killer knew the victims. And I’m thinking it was a woman.”
Carmichael snorted. “I don’t believe we got to sit here and listen to this. Nine times out of ten the killer knows the victim.”
“Shut up, Carmichael,” Murphy said. “What makes you say that, Harry?”
I stood up, and rubbed at my face with my hands. “The way magic works. Whenever you do something with it, it comes from inside of you. Magicians have to focus on what they’re trying to do, visualize it, believe in it, to make it work. You can’t make something happen that isn’t a part of you, inside. The killer could have murdered them both and made it look like an accident, but she did it this way. To get it done this way, she would have had to want them dead for very personal reasons, to be willing to reach inside them like that. Revenge, maybe. Maybe you’re looking for a lover or a spouse.
“Also because of when they died—in the middle of sex. It wasn’t a coincidence. Emotions are a kind of channel for magic, a path that can be used to get to you. She picked a time when they’d be together and be charged up with lust. She got samples to use as a focus, and she planned it out in advance. You don’t do that to strangers.”
“Crap,” Carmichael said, but this time it was more of a distracted curse than anything directed at me.
Murphy glared at me. “You keep saying ‘she,’” she challenged me. “Why the hell do you think that?”
I gestured toward the room. “Because you can’t do something that bad without a whole lot of hate,” I said. “Women are better at hating than men. They can focus it better, let it go better. Hell, witches are just plain meaner than magicians. This feels like feminine vengeance of some kind to me.”
“But a man could have done it,” Murphy said.
“Well,” I faltered.
“Christ, you are a sexist pig, Dresden. Is it something that only a woman could have done?”
“Well. No. I don’t think so.”
“You don’t think so?” Carmichael said slowly. “Some expert.”
I frowned at them both, angry. “I haven’t really worked through the specifics of what I’d need to do to make somebody’s heart explode, Murph. As soon as I have occasion to I’ll be sure to let you know.”
“When will you be able to tell me something?” Murphy asked.
“I don’t know.” I held up a hand, stopping her next comment. “I can’t put a timer on this stuff, Murph. It just can’t be done. I don’t even know if I can do it at all, much less how long it will take.”
“At fifty bucks an hour, it better not be too long,” Carmichael growled. Murphy glanced at him. She didn’t exactly agree with him, but she didn’t exactly slap him down, either.
I took the opportunity to take a few long breaths, calming myself down. I finally looked back at them. “Okay,” I asked. “Who are they? The victims.”
“You don’t need to know that,” Carmichael snapped.
“Ron,” Murphy said. “I could really use some coffee.”
Carmichael turned to her. He wasn’t tall, but he all but loomed over Murphy. “Aw, come on, Murph. This guy’s jerking your chain. You don’t really think he’s going to be able to tell you anything worth hearing, do you?”
Murphy regarded her partner’s damp, small-eyed face with a sort of cold arrogance, tough to pull off on someone six inches taller than she. “No cream, two sugars.”
“Dammit,” Carmichael said. He shot me a cold glance (but didn’t quite look at my eyes), then jammed his hands into his pants pockets and stalked out of the room.
Murphy followed him to the door, her feet silent, and shut it behind him. The sitting room immediately became darker, closer, with the grinning monster of its former cheap intimacy dancing in the smell of the blood and the memory of the two bodies in the next room.
“The woman’s name was Jennifer Stanton. She worked for the Velvet Room.”
I whistled. The Velvet Room was a high-priced escort service run by a woman named Bianca. Bianca kept a flock of beautiful, charming, and clever women, catering them to the richest men in the area for hundreds of dollars an hour. Bianca sold the kind of female company that most men only see on television and the movies. I also knew that she was a vampire of considerable influence in the Nevernever. She had Power with a capital P.
I’d tried to explain the Nevernever to Murphy before. She didn’t really comprehend it, but she understood that Bianca was a powerful figure vampire who sometimes disputed for territory. We both knew that if one of Bianca’s girls was involved, the vampire must have been involved somehow, too.
Murphy cut right to the point. “Was this part of one of Bianca’s territorial disputes?”
“No,” I said. “Unless she’s having it with a human magician. A vampire, even a vampire magician, couldn’t have pulled off something like this outside of the Nevernever.”
“Could she be at odds with a human magician?” Murphy asked me.
“Possible. But it doesn’t sound like her. She isn’t that stupid.” What I didn’t tell Murphy was that the White Council made sure that vampires who interfered with mortal practitioners never lived to brag about it. I don’t talk to regular people about the White Council. It just isn’t done. “Besides,” I said, “if a human wanted to take a shot at Bianca by hitting her girls, he’d be better off to kill the girl and leave the customer healthy, to let him spread the tale and scare off business.”
“Mmph,” Murphy said. She wasn’t convinced, but she made notes of what I had said.
“Who was the man?” I asked her.
Murphy looked up at me for a moment, and then said, evenly, “Tommy Tomm.”
I blinked at her to let her know she hadn’t revealed the mystery of the ages. “Who?”
“Tommy Tomm,” she said. “Johnny Marcone’s bodyguard.”
Now it made sense. “Gentleman” Johnny Marcone had been the thug to emerge on top of the pile after the Vargassi family had dissolved into internal conflict. The police department saw Marcone as a mixed blessing, after years of ruthless struggle and bloody exchanges with the Vargassis. Gentleman Johnny tolerated no excesses in his organization, and he didn’t like independent workers operating in his city. Robbers, bank robbers, and drug dealers who were not a part of his organization somehow always seemed to get ratted out and turned in, or else simply went missing and weren’t heard from again.
Marcone was a civilizing influence on crime—and where he operated, it was more of a problem in terms of scale than ever before. An extremely clever businessman, he had a battery of lawyers working for him that kept him fenced in from the law behind a barrier of depositions and papers and tape recordings. The cops never said it, but sometimes it seemed like they were almost reluctant to chase him. Marcone was better than the alternative—chaos in the underworld.
“I remember hearing he had an enforcer,” I said. “I guess he doesn’t anymore.”
Murphy shrugged. “So it would seem.”
“So what will you do next?”
“Run down this hairdresser angle, I guess. I’ll talk to Bianca and to Marcone, but I can already tell you what they’ll tell me.” She flicked her notebook closed and shook her head, annoyed.
I watched her for a minute. She looked tired. I told her so.
“I am tired,” she replied. “Tired of being looked at like I’m some sort of lunatic. Even Carmichael, my own partner, thinks I’ve gone over the edge in all of this.”
“The rest of the station think so too?” I asked her.
“Most of them just frown and spin their index fingers around their temples when they think I’m not looking, and file my reports without ever reading them. The rest are the ones who have run into something eerie out there, and they’re scared terrified. They don’t want to believe in anything they didn’t see on Mister Science when they were kids.”
“How about you?”
“Me?” Murphy smiled, a curving of her lips that was a vividly feminine expression, making her look entirely too pretty to be such a tough person. “The world’s falling apart at the seams, Harry. I guess I just think people are pretty arrogant to believe we’ve learned everything there is to know in the past century or so. What the hell. I can buy that we’re just now starting to see the things around us in the dark again. It appeals to the skeptic in me.”
“I wish everyone thought like you do,” I said. “It would cut down on my crank calls.”
She continued to smile at me, impish. “But could you imagine a world where all the radio stations played ABBA?”
We shared a laugh. God, that room needed a laugh.
“Hey, Harry,” Murphy said, grinning. I could see the wheels spinning in her head.
“Yeah?”
“What you said about being able to figure out how the killer did this. About how you’re not sure you can do it.”
“Yeah?”
“I know it’s nonsense. Why did you lie to me about it?”
I stiffened. Christ, she was good. Or maybe I’m just not much of a liar. “Look, Murph,” I said. “There’s some things you just don’t do.”
“Sometimes I don’t want to get into the head of the slime I go after, either. But you do what needs to be done to finish the job. I know what you mean, Harry.”
“No,” I said, shortly. “You don’t know.” And she didn’t. She didn’t know about my past, or the White Council, or the Doom of Damocles hanging over my head. Most days, I could pretend I didn’t know about it, either.
All the Council needed now was an excuse, just an excuse, to find me guilty of violating one of the Seven Laws of Magic, and the Doom would drop. If I started putting together a recipe for a murder spell, and they found out about it, that might be all the excuse they needed.
“Murph,” I told her. “I can’t try figuring this spell out. I can’t go putting together the things I’d need to do it. You just don’t understand.”
She glared at me, without looking at my eyes. I hadn’t ever met anyone else who could pull that one off. “Oh, I understand. I understand that I’ve got a killer loose that I can’t catch in the act. I understand that you know something that can help, or you can at least find out something. And I understand that if you dry up on me now, I’m tearing your card out of the department Rolodex and tossing it in the trash.”
Son of a bitch. My consulting for the department paid a lot of my bills. Okay, most of my bills. I could understand her, I supposed. If I was operating in the dark like she was, I’d be nervous as hell, too. Murphy didn’t know anything about spells or rituals or talismans, but she knew human hatred and violence all too well.
It wasn’t as though I was actually going to be doing any black magic, I told myself. I was just going to be figuring out how it was done. There was a difference. I was helping the police in an investigation, nothing more. Maybe the White Council would understand that.
Yeah, right. And maybe one of these days I’d go to an art museum and become well rounded.
Murphy set the hook a second later. She looked up at my eyes for a daring second before she turned away, her face tired and honest and proud. “I need to know everything you can tell me, Harry. Please.”
Classic lady in distress. For one of those liberated, professional women, she knew exactly how to jerk my old-fashioned chains around.
I clenched my teeth. “Fine,” I said. “Fine. I’ll start on it tonight.” Hooboy. The White Council was going to love this one. I’d just have to make sure they didn’t find out about it.
Murphy nodded and let out a breath without looking at me. Then she said, “Let’s get out of here,” and walked toward the door. I didn’t try to beat her to it.
When we walked out, the uniform cops were still idling around in the hall outside. Carmichael was nowhere to be seen. The investigators were there, standing around restlessly, waiting for us to come out. Then they gathered up their plastic bags and tools and lights and things and filed past us into the room.
Murphy was brushing at her tousled hair with her hand while we waited for the ancient elevator to take its sweet time getting up to the seventh floor. She was wearing a gold watch, which reminded me. “Oh, hey,” I asked her. “What time is it?”
She checked. “Two twenty-five. Why?”
I breathed out a curse, and turned for the stairs. “I’m late for my appointment.”
I fairly flew down the stairs. I’ve had a lot of practice at them, after all, and I hit the lobby at a trot. I managed to dodge a porter coming through the front doors with a load of luggage, and swung out onto the sidewalk at a stride. I have long legs that eat a lot of ground. I was running into the wind, my black duster flapping out behind me.
It was several blocks to my building, and after covering half of them I slowed to a walk. I didn’t want to arrive at my appointment with Monica Missing-Man panting like a bellows, with my hair disheveled and my face streaming with sweat.
Blame it on being out of shape from a sluggish winter season, but I was breathing hard. It occupied enough of my attention that I didn’t see the dark blue car until it had pulled up beside me, and a rather large man had stepped out of it onto the sidewalk in front of me. He had bright red hair and a thick neck. His face looked like someone had smashed it flat with a board, repeatedly, when he was a baby—except for his protruding eyebrows. He had narrow little blue eyes that got narrower as I sized him up.
I stopped, and backed away, then turned around. Two more men, both of them as tall as me and a good deal heavier, were slowing down from their own run. They had apparently been following me, and they looked annoyed. One was hobbling slightly, and the other wore a crew cut that had been styled up straight with some kind of styling gel. I felt like I was in high school again, surrounded by bullying members of the football team.
“Can I help you gentlemen?” I asked. I looked around for a cop, but they were all over at the Madison, I supposed. Everyone likes to stare.
“Get in the car,” the one in front of me said. One of the others opened the rear door.
“I like to walk. It’s good for my heart.”
“You don’t get in the car, it isn’t going to be good for your legs,” the man growled.
A voice came from inside the car. “Mister Hendricks, please. Be more polite. Mister Dresden, would you join me for a moment? I’d hoped to give you a lift back to your office, but your abrupt exit made it somewhat problematic. Perhaps you will allow me to convey you the rest of the way.”
I leaned down to look into the backseat. A man of handsome and modest features, dressed in a casual sports jacket and Levi’s, regarded me with a smile. “And you would be?” I asked him.
His smile widened, and I swear it made his eyes sparkle.
“My name is John Marcone. I would like to discuss business with you.”
I stared at him for a moment. And then my eyes slid aside to the very large and very muscular Mister Hendricks. The man growled under his breath, and it sounded like Cujo just before he jumped at the woman in the car. I didn’t feel like fighting it out with Cujo and his two buddies.
So I got into the back of the Caddy with Gentleman Johnny Marcone.
It was turning out to be a very busy day. And I was still late for my appointment.
# Chapter Three
Gentleman Johnny Marcone didn’t look like the sort of man who would have my legs broken or my jaw wired shut. His salt-and-pepper hair was cut short, and there were lines from sun and smiling marked into the corners of his eyes. His eyes were the green of well-used dollar bills. He seemed more like a college football coach: good-looking, browned, athletic, and enthusiastic. The impression was reinforced by the men he kept with him. Cujo Hendricks loomed like an all-pro player who had been removed for extreme unnecessary roughness.
Cujo got in the car again, glowered at me in the mirror, then pulled out into the street, driving slowly toward my office. The steering wheel looked tiny and delicate in his huge hands. I made a mental note: Do not let Cujo put his hands around your throat. Or hand. It looked almost like one of them could manage it.
The radio was playing, but as I got in the car it messed up, squealing feedback out over the speakers. Hendricks frowned and thought about it for a second. Maybe he had to pass on the message through his second brain or something. Then he reached out and adjusted with the knobs before finally turning the radio off. At this rate I hoped the car would make it all the way to my office.
“Mister Dresden,” Marcone said, smiling, “I understand that you work for the police department, from time to time.”
“They throw the occasional bit my way,” I agreed. “Hey, Hendricks. You should really wear your seat belt. Statistics say you’re fifty or sixty percent safer.”
Cujo growled at me in the mirror again, and I beamed at him. Smiling always seems to bother people more than actually insulting them. Or maybe I just have an annoying smile.
Marcone seemed somewhat put off by my attitude. Maybe I was supposed to be holding my hat in my hand, but I had never really liked Francis Ford Coppola, and I didn’t have a Godfather. (I do have a guardian, and she is, inevitably perhaps, a fairy. But that’s another story.) “Mister Dresden,” he said. “How much would it cost to retain your services?”
That made me wary. What would someone like Marcone want me for? “My standard fee is fifty dollars an hour plus travel expenses,” I told him. “But it can vary, depending on what you need done.”
Marcone nodded along with my sentences, as if encouraging me to speak. He creased up his face as if carefully considering what he would say, and taking my well-being into account with grandfatherly concern. “How much would it set me back to have you not investigate something?”
“You want to pay me to not do something?”
“Let’s say I pay you your standard fee. That comes out to fourteen hundred a day, right?”
“Twelve hundred, actually,” I corrected him.
He beamed at me. “An honest man is a rare treasure. Twelve hundred a day. Let’s say I pay you for two weeks’ worth of work, Mister Dresden, and you take some time off. Go catch a few movies, get some extra sleep, that sort of thing.”
I eyed him. “And for more than a thousand dollars a day, you want me to…?”
“Do nothing, Mister Dresden.” Marcone smiled. “Nothing at all. Just relax, and put your feet up. And stay out of Detective Murphy’s way.”
Ah-hah. Marcone didn’t want me looking into Tommy Tomm’s murder. Interesting. I looked out the window and squinted my eyes, as though thinking about it.
“I’ve got the money with me,” Marcone said. “Cash on the spot. I’ll trust you to fulfill your end of the deal, Mister Dresden. You come highly recommended for your honesty.”
“Mmmm. I don’t know, John. I’m kind of busy to be accepting any more accounts right now.” The car was almost to my office building. The car door was still unlocked. I hadn’t worn my seat belt, either—just in case I needed to throw the door open and jump out. See how I think ahead? It’s that magical intellect—and suspicion.
Marcone’s smile wavered. His expression became earnest. “Mister Dresden, I am quite eager to establish a positive working relationship, here. If it’s the money, I can offer you more. Let’s say double your usual fee.” He clasped his hands in front of him as he talked, half-turning toward me. My God, I kept expecting him to tell me to go out there and win one for the Gipper. He smiled. “How does that sound?”
“It isn’t the money, John,” I told him. I casually locked my eyes onto his. “I just don’t think it’s going to work out.”
To my surprise, he didn’t look away.
Those who deal in magic learn to see the world in a slightly different light than everyone else. You gain a perspective you had never considered before, a way of thinking that would just never have occurred to you without exposure to the things a magician sees and hears.
When you look into someone’s eyes, you see them in that other light. And, for just a second, they see you in the same way. Marcone and I looked at one another.
He was a soldier, a warrior, behind that relaxed smile and fatherly manner. He was going to get what he wanted and he was going to get it in the most efficient way possible. He was a dedicated man—dedicated to his goals, dedicated to his people. He never let fear affect him. He made a living on human misery and suffering, dealing in drugs and flesh and stolen goods, but he took steps to minimize that suffering because it was simply the most efficient means of running his business. He was furious over Tommy Tomm’s death—a cold and practical kind of fury that his rightful dominion had been invaded and challenged. He intended to find those responsible and deal with them in his own way—and he didn’t want the police interfering. He had killed before, and would again, and it would all mean nothing more to him than a business transaction, than paying for groceries in the payment line. It was a dry and cool place, inside Gentleman Johnny Marcone. Except for one dim corner. There, hidden away from his everyday thoughts, there lurked a secret shame. I couldn’t quite see what it was. But I knew that somewhere in the past there was something that he would give anything to undo, would spill blood to erase. It was from that dark place that he drew his resolve, his strength.
That was the way I saw him when I looked inside, past all his appearances and defenses. And I was, on some instinctual level, certain that he had been aware of what I would see if I looked—that he had deliberately met my gaze, knowing what he would give away. That was his purpose in getting me alone. He wanted to take a look at my soul. He wanted to see what sort of man I was.
When I look into someone’s eyes, into their soul, their deepest being, they can see mine in return—the things I had done, the things I was willing to do, the things I was capable of doing. Most people who did that got really pale, at least. One woman had passed out entirely. I didn’t know what they saw when they looked in there—it wasn’t a place I poked around much, myself.
John Marcone wasn’t like the other people who had seen my soul. He didn’t even blink an eye. He just looked and assessed, and after the moment had passed, he nodded at me as though he understood something. I got the uncomfortable impression that he had tricked me. That he had found out more about me than I had about him. The first thing I felt was anger, anger at being manipulated, anger that he should presume to look into my soul.
Just a second later, I felt scared to death of this man. I had looked on his soul and it had been as solid and barren as a stainless-steel refrigerator. It was more than disturbing. He was strong, inside, savage and ruthless without being cruel. He had a tiger’s soul.
“All right, then,” he said, smoothly, and as though nothing had happened. “I won’t try to force my offer on you, Mister Dresden.” The car was slowing down as it approached my building, and Hendricks pulled over in front of it. “But let me offer you some advice.” He had dropped the father-talking-to-son act, and spoke in a calm and patient voice.
“If you don’t charge for it.” Thank God for jokes. I was too rattled to have said anything intelligent.
Marcone almost smiled. “I think you’ll be happier if you come down with the flu for a few days. This business that Detective Murphy has asked you to look into doesn’t need to be dragged out into the light. You won’t like what you see. It’s on my side of the fence. Just let me deal with it, and it won’t ever trouble you.”
“Are you threatening me?” I asked him. I didn’t think he was, but I didn’t want him to know that. It would have helped if my voice hadn’t been shaking.
“No,” he said, frankly. “I have too much respect for you to resort to something like that. They say that you’re the real thing, Mister Dresden. A real magus.”
“They also say I’m crazy as a madman.”
“I choose which ‘they’ I listen to very carefully,” Marcone said. “Think about what I’ve said, Mister Dresden. I do not think our respective lines of work need overlap often. I would as soon not make an enemy of you over this matter.”
I clenched my jaw over my fear, and spat words out at him quick and hard. “You don’t want to make an enemy of me, Marcone. That wouldn’t be smart. That wouldn’t be smart at all.”
He narrowed his eyes at me, lazy and relaxed. He could meet my eyes by then without fear. We had taken a measure of one another. It would not happen in such a way again. “You really should try to be more polite, Mister Dresden,” he said. “It’s good for business.”
I didn’t give him an answer to that: I didn’t have one that wouldn’t sound frightened or stupidly tough. Instead, I told him, “If you ever lose your car keys, give me a call. Don’t try offering me money or threats again. Thanks for the ride.”
He watched me, his expression never changing, as I got out of the car and shut the door. Hendricks pulled out and drove away, after giving me one last dirty look. I had stared deeply at several people before. It wasn’t the sort of thing you forgot. I had never run into someone like that, someone so cool and controlled—even the other practitioners I had met gazes with had not been that way. None of them had simply assessed me like a column of numbers and filed it away for reference in future equations.
I stuck my hands in the pockets of my duster, and shivered as the wind hit me. I was a magician, throwing around real magic, I reminded myself. I was not afraid of big men in big cars. I do not get rattled by corpses blasted from life by magic more intense than anything I could manage. Really. Honest.
But those dollar-bill-colored eyes, backed by that cool and nearly unemotional soul, had me shaking as I took the stairs back up to my office. I had been stupid. He had surprised me, and the sudden intimacy of the intense gaze had startled and frightened me. All added together, it had caused me to fall apart, throwing threats at him like a frightened child. Marcone was a predator. He practically smelled my fear. If he got to thinking I was weak, I had a feeling that polite smile and fatherly facade would vanish as thoroughly and as quickly as it had appeared.
What a rotten first impression.
Oh, well. At least I was going to be on time for my appointment.
# Chapter Four
Monica No-Last-Name was standing outside of my office when I got there, writing on the back of the note I had left taped to my office door.
I walked toward her, but she was too intent upon her writing to look up. She was a good-looking woman, in her mid-thirtysomethings. Ash blond hair that I thought must be natural, after a dark and automatic memory of the dead woman’s coloring job. Her makeup was tasteful and well applied, and her face was fair, friendly, with enough roundness of cheek to look fresh-faced and young, enough fullness of mouth to look very feminine. She was wearing a long, full skirt of palest yellow with brown riding boots, a crisp white blouse, and an expensive-looking green sweater over it, to ward off the chill of early spring. She had to be in good shape to pull off a color combination like that, and she did it. Overall, it was an annoyingly familiar look, something like Annette Funicello or Barbara Billingsley, maybe—good and all-American.
“Monica?” I asked. I put on my most innocent and friendly smile.
She blinked at me as I approached. “Oh. Are you, um, Harry…”
I smiled and offered her my hand. “Harry Dresden, ma’am. That’s me.”
She took my hand after a tiny pause and kept her eyes firmly focused on my chest. At this point, I was just as glad to be dealing with someone who was too nervous to risk looking at my eyes. I gave her a firm but gentle hand clasp, and let go of her, brushing past her to unlock the office door and open it up. “I apologize for being late. I got a call from the police that I had to look in on.”
“You did?” she asked. “You mean, the police, um…” She waved her fingers instead of finishing the sentence and entered when I held the door open for her.
“Sometimes.” I nodded. “They run into something and want my take on it.”
“What sorts of things?”
I shrugged and swallowed. I thought of the corpses at the Madison, and felt green. When I looked up at Monica, she was studying my face, chewing on her lip nervously. She hurriedly averted her gaze.
“Can I get you some coffee?” I asked her. I shut the door behind us, flicked on the lights.
“Oh. No, thank you. I’m fine.” She stood there, looking at my box of discarded paperbacks and holding her purse over her stomach with both hands. I thought she might scream if I said boo so I made sure to move carefully and slowly, making myself a cup of instant coffee. I breathed in and out, going through the familiar motions, until I had calmed down from my encounter with Marcone. By the time I was done, so was my coffee. I went to my desk, and invited her to have a seat in one of the two chairs across from me.
“Okay, Monica,” I said. “What can I do for you today?”
“Well, um. I told you that my husband was…was…” She nodded at me, gesturing.
“Missing?” I supplied.
“Yes,” she said with a sigh of almost relief. “But he’s not mysteriously missing or anything. Just gone.” She flushed and stuttered. “Like he just packed up a few things and left. But he didn’t say anything to anyone. And he hasn’t showed up again. I’m concerned about him.”
“Uh-huh,” I said. “How long has he been gone?”
“This is the third day,” she said.
I nodded. “There must be some reason why you’re coming to me, rather than a private investigator or the police.”
She reddened again. She had a good face for blushing, fair skin that colored girlishly. It was quite fetching, really. “Yes, um. He had been interested in…in…”
“Magic?”
“Yes. He had been buying books on it in the religion section at the bookstore. Not like those Dungeons and Dragons games. The real thing. He bought some of those fortune cards.” She pronounced it like carrot. Amateurs.
“And you think his disappearance might have had something to do with this interest?”
“I’m not sure,” she confessed. “But maybe. He was very upset. He had just lost his job and was under a lot of pressure. I’m worried about him. I thought whoever found him might need to be able to talk to him about all of this stuff.” She took a deep breath, as if the effort of completing so many sentences without a single um had tired her.
“I’m still not clear on this. Why me? Why not the police?”
Her fingers whitened on her purse. “He packed a bag, Mr. Dresden. I think the police will just assume he left his wife and his children. They won’t really look. But he didn’t. He’s not like that. He only wants to make a good life for us. Really, that’s all he wants.”
I frowned at her. Nervous that maybe husband has run out on you after all, dear? “Even so,” I said, “why come to me? Why not a private investigator? I know a reliable man if you need one.”
“Because you know about…” She gestured, fitfully.
“About magic,” I said.
Monica nodded. “I think it might be important. I mean, I don’t know. But I think it might.”
“Where did he work?” I asked her. While I spoke, I got a pad of paper out of my pocket and noted down a few notes.
“His employer,” she told me. “They’re a trading company. They locate good markets for products and then advise companies where they can best spend their money.”
“Uh-huh,” I said. “What is his name, Monica?”
She swallowed, and I saw her shaking, trying to think of something to tell me other than his real name. “George,” she supplied at last.
I looked up at her. She was staring furiously down at her hands.
“Monica,” I said. “I know this must be really hard for you. Believe me, ma’am, there are plenty of people who are nervous when they come into my office. But please, hear me out. I am not out to hurt you or anyone else. What I do, I do to help people. It’s true that someone with the right skills could use your names against you, but I’m not like that.” I borrowed a line from Johnny Marcone. “It isn’t good business.”
She gave a nervous little laugh. “I feel so silly,” she confessed. “But there’s so many things that I’ve heard about…”
“Wizards. I see.” I put my pencil down and clasped my fingers in magical fashion. The woman was nervous and had certain expectations. I might ease her fears a little if I fulfilled some of them. I tried not to look over her shoulder at the calendar I had hanging on the wall, and the red circle around the fifteenth of last month. Late rent. Need money. Even with the fee from today and what I would make in the future, it would take the city forever to pay up.
Besides, I could never resist going to the aid of a lady in distress. Even if she wasn’t completely, one hundred percent sure that she wanted to be rescued by me.
“Monica,” I told her. “There are powers in the universe that most people don’t even know about. Powers that we still don’t fully understand. The men and women who work with these powers see things in a different light than regular people. They come to understand things in a slightly different way. This sets them apart. Sometimes it breeds unjustified suspicion and fear. I know you’ve read books and seen movies about how horrible people like me are, and that whole ‘suffer not a witch to live’ part of the Old Testament hasn’t made things all roses. But we really aren’t any different from anyone else.” I gave her my best smile. “I want to help you. But if I’m going to do that, you’re going to have to give me a little trust. I promise. I give you my word that I won’t disappoint you.”
I saw her take this in and chew on it for a while, while staring down at her hands.
“Victor,” she said at last. “Victor Sells.”
“All right,” I said, picking up my pencil and properly noting it. “Is there anywhere he might have gone that you can think of, casually?”
She nodded. “The lake house. We have a house down by…” She waved her hand.
“The lake?”
She beamed at me, and I reminded myself to be patient. “In Lake Providence, over the state line, around Lake Michigan. It’s beautiful up there in the autumn.”
“Okay, then. Are you aware of any friends he might have run off to see, family he might have visited, anything like that?”
“Oh, Victor wasn’t on speaking terms with his family. I never knew why. He didn’t talk about them, really. We’ve been married for ten years, and he never once spoke to them.”
“Okay,” I said, noting that down, too. “Friends, then?”
She bit her lip, a gesture that seemed familiar to her. “Not really. He was friends with his boss, and some people at work, but after he was fired…”
“Uh-huh,” I said. “I understand.” I continued writing things down, drawing bold lines between thoughts to separate them. I spilled over onto the next page before I was finished writing down the facts and my observations about Monica. I like to be thorough about this kind of thing.
“Well, Mr. Dresden?” she asked. “Can you help me?”
I looked over the page and nodded. “I think so, Monica. If possible, I’d like to see these things your husband collected. Which books and so on. It would help if I had a picture of him, too. I might like to take a look around your house at Lake Providence. Would that be all right?”
“Of course,” she said. She seemed relieved, but at the same time even more nervous than before. I noted down the address of the lake house and brief directions.
“You’re aware of my fees?” I asked her. “I’m not cheap. It might be less costly for you to hire someone else.”
“We’ve got quite a bit of savings, Mr. Dresden,” she told me. “I’m not worried about the money.” That seemed an odd statement from her, at the time—out of tune with her generally nervous manner.
“Well, then,” I told her. “I charge fifty dollars an hour, plus expenses. I’ll send you an itemized list of what I do, so you’ll have a good idea what I’m working on. A retainer is customary. I’m not going to guarantee that I work exclusively on your case. I try to handle each of my customers with respect and courtesy, so I can’t put any one of them before another.”
She nodded to me, strongly, and reached into her purse. She drew out a white envelope and passed it over to me. “There’s five hundred inside,” she told me. “Is that enough for now?”
Cha-ching. Five hundred dollars would take care of last month’s rent and a good bit of this month’s, too. I could get into this bit with nervous clients wanting to preserve the anonymity of their checking accounts from my supposed magical might. Cash always spends.
“That will be fine, yes,” I told her. I tried not to touch the envelope. At least I wasn’t crude enough to dump the money on my desk and count it out.
She drew out another envelope. “He took most of his things with him,” she said. “At least, I couldn’t find them where he usually keeps them. But I did find this.” There was something in the envelope, making it swell, a pendant, ring, or charm of some kind, I was betting. A third envelope came out of her purse—the woman must be obsessively well organized. “There’s a picture of him in here, and my phone number inside. Thank you, Mr. Dresden. When will you call?”
“As soon as I know something,” I told her. “Probably by tomorrow afternoon or Saturday morning. Sound good?”
She almost looked at my eyes, caught herself, and smiled directly at my nose instead. “Yes. Yes, thank you so much for your help.” She glanced up at the wall. “Oh, look at the time. I need to go. School’s almost out.” She closed her teeth over her words and flushed again, as though embarrassed that she had let such an important fact about her slip out.
“I’ll do whatever I can, ma’am,” I assured her, rising, and walking her to the door. “Thank you for your business. I’ll be in touch soon.”
She said her farewells, never looking me in the face, and fled out the door. I shut it behind her and went back to the envelopes.
First, the money. It was all in fifties, which always look new even when they’re years old because they get so little circulation. There were ten of them. I put them in my wallet, and trashed the envelope.
The envelope with the photo in it was next. I took it out and regarded a picture of Monica and a man of lean and handsome features, with a wide forehead and bushy eyebrows that distorted his handsomeness off onto a rather eccentric angle. His smile was whiter-than-white, and his skin had the smooth, dark complexion of someone who spends a lot of time in the sun, boating maybe. It was a sharp contrast against Monica’s paleness. Victor Sells, I presume.
The phone number was written on a plain white index card that had been neatly trimmed down to fit inside the envelope. There was no name or area code, just a seven-digit number. I got out my cross-listing directory and looked it up.
I noted that down as well. I wondered what the woman had expected to accomplish by only giving out first names, when she had been going to hand me a dozen other ways of finding out in any case. It only goes to show that people are funny when they’re nervous about something. They say odd things, make odd choices which, in retrospect, they feel amazingly foolish for making. I would have to be careful not to say anything to rub that in when I spoke to her again.
I trashed the second envelope and opened the last one, turning it inverted over my desk.
The brown shell of a dead, dried scorpion, shining with some sort of preservative coating, clicked down onto my desk. A supple, woven leather cord led off from a ring set through the base of its tail, so that if it was worn, it would hang head down, tail up and curled over the dried body to point at the ground.
I shuddered. Scorpions were symbolically powerful in certain circles of belief. They weren’t usually symbols of anything good or beneficial, either. A lot of petty, mean spells could be focused around a little talisman like that. If you wore it next to your skin, as such things are supposed to be worn, the spiky legs of the thing would be a constant poking and irritation at your chest, a continual reminder that it was there. The dried barb at the tail’s tip might actually pierce the skin of anyone who tried to give the wearer a hug. Its crab-shaped claws would catch in a man’s chest hair, or scratch at the curves of a woman’s breasts. Nasty, unpleasant thing. Not evil, as such—but you sure as hell weren’t likely to do happy shiny things with magic with such an item around your neck.
Maybe Victor Sells had gotten involved in something real, something that had absorbed his attention. The Art could do that to a person—particularly the darker aspects of it. If he had turned to it in despair after losing his job, maybe that would explain his sudden absence from his home. A lot of magicians or would-be magicians isolated themselves in the belief that isolation would increase their ability to focus on their magic. It didn’t—but it did make it easier for a weak or inexperienced mind to avoid distractions.
Or maybe it wasn’t even a true talisman. Maybe it was just a curiosity, or a souvenir from some visit to the Southwest. There wasn’t any way for me to tell if it was indeed a device used to improve the focus and direction of magical energies, short of actually using it to attempt a spell—and I really didn’t want to be using such a dubious article, for a variety of good reasons.
I would have to keep this little un-beauty in mind as I tried to run this man down. It might well mean nothing. On the other hand, it might not. I looked up at the clock. A quarter after three. There was time to check with the local mortuaries to see if they had turned up any likely John Does—who knew, my search might be over before the day’s end—and then to get to the bank to deposit my money and fire off a check to my landlord.
I got out my phone book and started calling up hospitals—not really my routine line of work, but not difficult, either, except for the standard problems I had using the telephone: static, line noise, other people’s conversations being louder than mine. If something can go wrong, it will.
Once I thought I saw something out of the corner of my eye, a flicker of motion from the dried bug that sat on my desk. I blinked and stared at it. It didn’t move. Cautiously, I extended my senses toward it like an invisible hand, feeling about for any traces of magic or magical energy.
Nothing. It was as dry of magic as it was of life.
Never let it be said that Harry Dresden is afraid of a dried, dead bug. Scary or not, I wasn’t going to let it ruin my concentration.
So I scooped it up with the corner of the phone book and popped it into the middle drawer of my desk. Out of sight, out of mind.
So I have a problem with scary, dead, poisonous things. So sue me.
