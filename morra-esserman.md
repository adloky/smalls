# Introduction. The Much Maligned Morra

After 1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3, we reach the starting position of the much maligned Morra Gambit. I must confess that this is often the moment in my chess praxis when my heart thumps most - will my opponent accept the sacrifice in the spirit of the Romantics, or will he shun the most honorable path and meekly decline? Sometimes I wait for the critical decision for many minutes as my grandmaster foe flashes me an incredulous, bordering on insulted, look. Other times, I receive the answer almost instantaneously. Yet every time I am greeted with 3...dxc3, I could not be happier. My knight freely flows to c3, the Morra accepted appears, and we travel back in time to the 19th century. Already ahead a full tempo in development, I smile, knowing that all of my pieces will soon flood the center. My bishops will zoom to the central diagonals, and my nimble queen will influence any sector of the board she desires. Meanwhile, Black remains cramped. His queen and bishops lie sleeping, and while his queen's knight can reach c6 unharmed, the king's knight must constantly fret about the dangerous e4-e5 thrust.

## The Morra Gambit vs. the King's and Evans gambits

But this only scratches at the surface of the gambit's depth. In order to fully appreciate why the Morra can endure the 21st century's rigorous analytical microscope, we must first compare the gambit to its two elder brothers which have virtually disappeared from top level chess, the King's and Evans gambits. In the King's Gambit,

White sacrifices his king's bishop pawn for central dominance. However, his aggression comes at a hefty price -not only does he lose a pawn, but all of the squares around his king are critically weakened forever. So often it is not White's minus pawn in the King's Gambit, but a compromised king, which ultimately leads to his demise. Likewise, in the swashbuckling Evans,

the gambiteer sacrifices his queen's knight pawn to gain tempi on the black bishop via c2-c3 and d2-d4, erecting a central pawn mass in the process. But again, the price is steep, as the lunging b2-b4 undermines the solidity of White's queenside, chiefly the c3- and c4- squares. In both of these illustrious openings, if the gambiteer does not swiftly sweep Black

off the board, his game will likely become positionally bankrupt. To cast further doubt upon the ancient gambits, after 1.e4 e5, Black's king's bishop already can move, thus bringing him one step closer to castling out of danger. In contrast, in the Morra Gambit, the bishop starts buried on f8. As a result, Black's king often never escapes the pelting central crossfire.

Yet it's not all so cut and dry. To the credit of Morra bashers, Black does possess a full extra central pawn for his woes (while in the King's and Evans gambits, White sacrifices only a flank pawn.) But to take the conversation into the concrete, Black can blunt the Morra gambiteer's assault on the sensitive f7-square with ...e6, a defense not available in the classical e4/e5 gambits. The extra central d-pawn then may make an immediate impact, sliding up to d6 and plugging any holes while restraining White's e4-e5 advances. No wonder then that the solid ...e6 and ...d6 pawn duo, establishing a Scheveningen Sicilian-like fortress, is one of the most trusted ways to subdue Morra mayhem.

Yet in the final analysis, the secret to the Morra Gambit's longevity lies not solely in the tactical arena (all gambits pose immediate tactical dangers to the defender). Rather, the Morra is also firmly positionally grounded. For starters, a Morra gambiteer may safely castle and tuck away his king on g1 behind a healthy blanket ofpawn cover. The same luxury is not available in the King's Gambit (so aptly named for throwing the white king's safety to the wind). On the other end of the board, White's rooks may rush to c1 and d1, where they will chew up central squares on the wide open c- and d-files. Take a close look at the Morra accepted starting position again - White simply has no obvious weaknesses! This fact alone can breed a doomsday psychology from the defender as

he struggles to deal with reality. He knows he is up a pawn, he knows he should win easily - after all, the chess authorities said so. As all of these thoughts cloud his thinking, the freewheeling gambiteer slowly increases the pressure, his pieces ready to ravage. Even in the worst case scenario, when White's potent e4-pawn and Black's passive d6-pawn swap off and the gambiteer obtains only nebulous compensation in return, the menacing Morra rooks and imposing centralization of White's forces can still strain the defender's delicate psyche.

## The d4-square – White's only true weakness

Only a keen eye can spot the one true defect in White's starting position: the d4-square. As a result of pushing 1 e4 and then shedding the c pawn, the gambiteer lacks proper pawn protection against an enemy incursion on d4. Particularly, a black knight plopping on d4, especially when supported by the e5-pawn, can virtually paralyze White. However, to access the d4 soft spot, the defender must make some serious concessions.

Black has just played ...e6-e5, securing a foothold on d4. In return, he surrenders the d5-square for White's pieces. But hastily

probing the d5-square further with 10.Bg5(?) meets strict punishment. After 10...Bg4! Black becomes master of the center, as the highly unpleasant threat of ...lt:ld4 looms large. A Morra virtuoso would never allow such a beast into the heart of his camp, and instead would overprotect d4 with Be3! immediately. Only after the sensitive d4-square is under lock and key would White then continue his plans to conquer d5 and the rest of the board.

## A good rule ofthumb - Chase the black queen!

Too often the novice gambiteer believes that there is only one formulaic setup for White, namely 5.Nf3, 6.Bc4, 7.0-0, 8.Qe2, 9.Rfd1, and then hope for the best. While this sequence is normally the correct method against the d6-e6 Scheveningen defenses, thinking in these simple terms will often get you into deep trouble. In fact, the savvy defender lies awake at night wishing that you have such a misunderstanding. Achieving Morra mastery requires great mental flexibility, but if you must abide by a Morra formula, the most powerful one would be: when in doubt, chase the black queen.

In the Open Sicilian, White's c2-pawn obstructs his rook from participating in the fight for the c-file. As a result, Black often makes the c-file his permanent base of operations, with a rook on c8 patrolling the half-open line and the black queen comfortably perched on c7. However, in the Morra Gambit, the fully open c-file morphs into White's greatest asset. The gambiteer's lead in development ensures that his queen's rook will reach c 1 first, thus serving fair warning to the black queen that c7 is no longer safe territory. The queen can be hounded on her original d8-square as well, as White's other rook can easily target her from dl. If she heads to e7, she may obstruct the

harmonious development of the king's bishop and the entire kingside in turn. If she pokes her head out to b6 or aS, she comes under fire from a pawn advance b2-b4 or a sleek Bd2 or Be3. If she obstinately tries to beat the queen's rook to the punch with a premature ...Qc7, White's queen's knight can harass her with Nb5 (or even the sacrificial Nd5) and White's queen's bishop can also get into the act with Bf4. And if she ever plays it too cool on b8, the entombed rook on a8 will pay dearly for her cowardice. As you can see, finding a harmonious square for the queen is Black's main headache in the Morra Gambit, and if he can solve this problem, he often solves the Morra riddle. Let us now witness some queen hunting in action.

## Chase #1

The following example, which made a great impression upon me as a young Morraphile, can be found in Graham Burgess's groundbreaking 1994 Smith-Morra Gambit book. Burgess featured the sequence to explain why Black cannot make simple developmental moves in the Morra Gambit and survive. We will be viewing it from a different lens, with an eye for rabidly chasing the black queen to and fro.

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 Nc6**

**5.Nf3**

In every example in this book, White's king's knight will develop to its natural f3-square.

**5...d6 6.Bc4**

Likewise, White's king's bishop takes aim on the aggressive "Italian" diagonal in almost all cases.'2

**6...e6**

BlackadoptsthesolidScheveningenstructure alluded to earlier, and so the gambiteer readies for the standard 0-0, V!le2, gdl plan.

**7.0-0 Nf6 8.Qe2 Be7 9.Rd1**

The chase begins. If the queen flees to c7, White's cavalry keeps stalking her via b5.

Here the old main line of the Morra Gambit, 9...e5, prevents White's e4-e5 thrust but consequently weakens the d5-square forever.

The passive 9...Bd7 also blocks the d-file pin but interferes with the queen's guard of d6. There are just no easy answers against the Morra's flowing compensation.

**9...0-0?**

**10.e5!**

Black is scolded for his carelessness, and must retreat to a fallback position.

**10...Ne8 11.exd6 Bd6**

11\...Nxd6 12.Bf4+- and the crushing pin decides. 12...e5 (12...a6 13.Bxd6 Bxd6 14.Ne4+-) 13.Nxe5 only prolongs the inevitable.

**12.Nb5! Qe7**

The hapless queen runs, but she cannot hide.

12\...a6 13.Nxd6 Nxd6 14.Bf4±

**13.Bg5!**


The queen has already been harried by both White's knight and rook. But now the bishop gives her the treatment, thus forcing a critical kingside weakness which will decide the outcome shortly.

**13...f6 14.Be3!**

Not just any random retreat! The bishop intends further mayhem after Nxd6 and Bc5.

**14...Bb8 15.Rac1!**

The heavy piece storm never relents. The Morra rooks reach their natural squares, and the game of hide and seek nears its conclusion. The gambiteer now menaces Bc5 followed by Bxe6, winning.

15\...Qf7, seeking refuge near her king, would still fail to Bc5.

**15...b6 16.Bb3!**

White remains a pawn down, but the rooks are chewing up the board, creating decisive threats against Black's minor pieces. Black is bullied to the back rank, a theme you will see throughout the book.

**16...Bb7**

16\...Bd7 17.Bc5 bxc5 18.Rxd7! Qxd7 19.Bxe6+- Chasing down the queen one last time.

**17.Bc5! bxc5 18.Bxe6**

18\.Rd7?! suggests itself. But the prosaic yet stronger text gives up less material for the queen.

**18...Kh8 19.Rd7!**

And the hunt finally ends. White's forces doggedly swarmed the queen, never letting her out of their sights.

## Chase #2

In our next example the black queen has mischiefon her mind early on. She aims to end the game immediately before White's pieces swirl about.

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 e6**

**5.Nf3 Nc6 6.Bc4 Qc7 7.0-0 Nf6**

Here, so many neophytes continue with the illogical Qe2. As the black queen just vanished from the d-file, the natural follow up Rd1 has therefore lost its sting. While already lacking in strategy, the mindless Vfie2 makes even less sense tactically...

**8.Nb5!**

8\.Qe2? Ng4! and Black readies to spring the infamous Siberian trap. I banish this snare to Chapter 1 so that you will never, ever fall for it. Such a coup simply makes the Morra bashers way too happy. 9.h3?? Nd4! And in the blink of an eye, White must either lose his queen or resign, as mate on h2 looms. What a teary tale for gambiteers worldwide. Observe once again that the fatal blow fell on the d4-square, the Morra's Achilles heel.

But if White follows the maxim of stalking the queen, he will not become the subject of public ridicule. Rather, the black queen will be reprimanded for her tricky ways, and sent back to "Siberia", or the frigid corner of the board, so to speak.

**8...Qb8 9.e5!**

White hopes that Black continues with his greedy strategy. First he took on c3, now will he grab twice?

**9...Nxe5?! 10.Nxe5! Qxe5 11.Re1!±**

And it is open season on the queen again. Her troubles are just beginning, as we shall find out soon enough.

## Chase #3

In our next display, also a main line, White has two different methods of pursuing the queen.

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 Nc6 5.Nf3 d6 6.Bc4 e6 7.0-0 a6**

Black takes a tempo to stop the pesky ctJb5 so that his queen can rest at c7, if only for a moment...

**8.Qe2 Nf6 9.Rd1 Qc7**

The gambiteer's bishop now sharply glares at the queen along the h2-b8 diagonal.



**10.Bf4! Be7 11.Rac1!?**

The Morra rook seizes control of the c-file, reminding the queen that this is no Open Sicilian. White can give chase immediately with ll.e5!?, leading to great complications, or delay the hunt...

**11...0-0 12.Bb3!**

And the rook draws one step closer to its target. 13.Nd5 beckons, forcing the defender to duck and cover.

## Chase #4

Our last example covers a variation favored by many strong grandmasters. Once again, the gambiteer's basic method of attack involves stalking the queen.

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 Nc6 5.Nf3 e6 6.Bc4 a6 7.0-0 Nge7!?**

With this sly move, Black intends to establish a firm grip on the central dark squares with ...ltJg6, then finish his development smoothly

after ...Be7, castles, ...b5, ...Bb7, and ...d6. The black queen dares not venture out and wisely hides behind a solid pawn shield at d7, thus making the hackneyed Qe2/Rd1 plan inert. White's standard e4-e5 thrust also becomes impotent, as instead of the pawn badgering the knight on f6, a knight on g6 will pester it. But the proper plan to cause chaos involves chasing the black queen, even though she may seem oh so far away.

**8.Bg5!**

Mter this powerful pin, suddenly Black cannot finish his development routinely. Note that if the black pawn stood at a7, White would already be threatening the knockout strike Nb5!/Nd6#.

To complete the ...Ne7-g6 slog, Black must brave either 8...f6 or 8...h6, producing subtle weaknesses surrounding his kingside complex. Or the queen can nobly take matters into her own hands with 8...Qc7, although on that square her struggles have already been well documented. White can then either slowly build up the pressure with 9.Rc1,or frenetically continue the chase with 9.Nd5!.

**8...Qc7**



**9.Nd5!**

## The d5-square - Ringoffire

"Bur didn't you just hang a piece on d5?" the skeptical reader may ask. "No, no, I merely invested the piece, and shall reap the rewards of my investment soon enough," the sage gambiteer may retort. Speaking of sacrificing knights (or bishops!) on d5, which one ofthese plunges on d5 would you make in your own games, and which ones, if any, are objectively sound? Some of these sacrifices on d5 you may already know, some of them you will be meeting for the first time...

**11.Nd5!?**

**9.Nd5!?**

**9.Nd5!?**

**11.Nd5!?**

**8.Nd5!?**

**10.Bd5!?**

**11.Nd5!?**

I hope that after completing this book, you will make at least half of these "leaps of faith" on d5. And how many of these sacrifices are indeed sound? None? Half? For the few of you who guessed all of them, you know who you are, and you are correct! Yes, every one of these sacrifices on d5 is completely sound and offers White excellent winning chances.

The d5-square is the Morra Gambit's ring of fire, the square where all mayhem breaks loose. We have already glossed over how d5 transforms into the featured battleground in the quiet Scheveningen lines when Black blockades with ...e6-e5. However, when a White piece offers its life on d5, the position can devolve into utter chaos. Knowing when a sacrifice on d5 is good, bad, or unclear is what often separates the amateur from the virtuoso Morra gambiteer. Sometimes the sacrifice is not just optional, but forced! In such hair-raising scenarios, tossing a piece into the fire early on will likely lead to a glorious win for White. Not taking the risk, on the other hand, will yield the advantage to Black. Quite a change from conventional thinking - after all, the chess world has enough trouble accepting that White can sacrifice a pawn in the opening stages, and now it must come to terms with a maniacal gambiteer donating a whole piece, often before move 10! Now a few general considerations and rules of thumb before you contemplate taking a dive on d5.

White sacrifices a knight on d5 primarily to rip open the e-file for a direct path to the black king. Refusing the sacrifice is usually untenable, as the monstrous knight stomps on all in its wake the longer it stampedes. After Black accepts the offering, the White e-pawn typically captures back on d5, regaining not only a pawn in the process, but cutting the enemy army in two. Once on d5, the white pawn grows exponentially in

strength. It may completely dominate a hapless bishop on b7 and subsequently bury the b8- knight, aS-rook, and therefore the entire Black queenside.

But that's only the half of it. From d5, the giant foot soldier may wedge further into Black's camp via d5-d6. Yes, on d6 it releases the shackled queenside pieces, but more importantly hems in Black's king's bishop, making the black king himself a fixed target for the decisive Re1.

Furthermore, the gambiteer's light-squared bishop then has a free path to the bloody f7-square, the main artery of the black king. While Black did everything in his power to shield f7 from the Italian bishop, White's sacrifice on d5 stripped away the e6-pawn's last layer of defense, leaving f7 wide open for future assault. Such a fate befell the black king in Esserman - Van Wely, Orlando 201 1, my most famous Morra Gambit victory.

Marc Esserman -Loek van Wely

**Orlando 2011**

**11.Nd5 exd5 12.exd5 Nce5 13.d6!**

Below are a few general guidelines for when you should and should not sacrifice on d5:

\1) It is rarely a good idea to sacrifice a knight on d5 when a black pawn already stands on d6, as you can no longer play the devastating d5-d6 yoursel£ Instead, your bishop may sit lifelessly behind the d5-pawn, and you may end up down a piece for little or no compensation.

\2) If a black knight stands on c6, sacrificing on d5 sizzles with possibility\. When you recapture on d5, you will gain a tempo on the c6-knight, and when it flees, you may be able to unleash the crushing d5-d6\.

\3) Sacrificing a knight on d5 is usually more effective when your light bishop already stands on b3\. The reason is twofold - for one, your bishop is less prone to a threat from an evacuating c6 knight (via e5 or a5), which will halt your attack for a critical tempo, and secondly, the c-file will be free for your queen's rook to ravage in the moves to come\.

\4) You should rarely sacrifice a knight on d5 after Black has castled, unless you are immediately winning back material\. The sacrifice is primarily designed to catch the king before he escapes the center\. Black should be at least one, but preferably two or more moves

away from castling before you consider surging into d5. You will need these precious tempi to conduct your attack.

\5) When Black wastes a vital tempo in the opening stage with \.\.\.b5-b4, hitting your knight, he is usually begging for a sacrifice on d5, and you should thank him kindly\. The extra tempo spent on \.\.\.b4 is valuable time lost when he could have organized his defense\.

\6) If Black ventures \.\.\.Nc6-a5 to attack your bishop on b3, assuming that he is far away from castling, you must consider sacrificing even the bishop on d5 instead of retreating or letting Black happily exchange with \.\.\.Nxb3\.

Of course there are no rules to follow in chess 100% of the time other than how the pieces move, but if you adhere to these guidelines you will have a much easier time making sense of the chaos surrounding the sacrifices on d5 streaming through this book. Lastly, if you are using a chess engine to assist your analysis, please take its evaluations when probing the sacrifices on d5 or other extreme situations in the Morra Gambit with serious skepticism. Like the majority of the chess public, the computer (Rybka, Houdini, Stockfish, Blowfish, or any other engine in existence) simply cannot fully fathom how White can be down a piece for seemingly little counterplay, and when it finally does start spitting out positive evaluations for the gambiteer, Black's position is often already beyond saving.

## The sensitive e6/f7 complex

While an early sacrifice on d5 may give rise to the most fantastic possibilities in the Morra Gambit, there are definitely other outlandish ways to find yourselfdown a full piece after ten moves in the gambit and still objectively play

for the win! In particular, sacrificing a white knight or bishop on e6 or f7 is the second most common method for mayhem. As discussed earlier, when Black adopts a Scheveningen formation, he does so primarily to speed up his kingside development while shielding the vulnerable f7-pawn. When the gambiteer sacrifices on e6 or f7, however, he strips away the venerable foot soldier, leaving the black king to fend for himself in the center as chaos engulfs the board. Understand that these sacrifices work best when Black's queen's bishop fails to defend e6, either because a Black piece on d7 obstructs its guard or because the bishop felt the need to drift away from its home post towards b7. Now for a few concrete examples:

## Into the Deep - 9.Ng5!

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 e6 5.Nf3 a6 6.Bc4 b5 7.Bb3 Bb7 8.0-0! d6**

Black chooses a Scheveningen setup, but with his e6/f7 complex severely compromised by the ill-timed ...Bb7. The gambiteer wastes no time and peppers the sensitive spot.

After 8...b4 we would descend into the chaotic world of 9.Nd5!.

**9.Ng5!**

White will wreak havoc on f7 and e6 as direct sacrificial blows and the savage Qh5 lurks. If Black stands idle, even the effortless f4-f5 will smash through.

## Finegold Defense - 12.Bxe6!

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Bxc3 d6 5.Nf3 e6 6.Bc4 Be7 7.0-0 Nf6 8.Qe2 a6 9.Rd1 b5 10.Bb3 Nbd7**

We arrive at the main position of the notorious Finegold Defense. Again, Black adopts a Scheveningen formation, but obstructs the bishop's guard of e6 while his king waits in the center to receive incoming missiles. With the preconditions for a strike on the e6/f7 complex met, the gambiteer does not hesitate.

**11.Nd4!?**

Black lacks the time to respond with 11...Nc5 as 12.Nc6 or 12.e5! first plows through.

**11...Bb7?!**

**12.Bxe6! fxe6 13.Nxe6**

And I went on to win in both Esserman - Chow, Chicago 2000 and Esserman - Finegold, Internet (blitz) 2006. The black king must endure a protracted central siege as White's rooks and minor pieces pillage.

## Chicago Defense - 10.Nd4!

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 e6 5.N6 a6 6.Bc4 d6 7.0-0 b5 8.Bb3 Ra7 9.Be3 Rd7**

A main variation of the Chicago Defense. Black places his rook on the awkward square d7 to shield his queen from the menacing Qe2, Rfd1, and e5. However, he again blocks his queen's bishop from guarding e6 in a Scheveningen system, so the thematic response should not be hard to spot.

**10.Nd4!**

Target acquired.


**10...Nf6 11.f4!**

The famous pawn advance, found principally in the Open Sicilian, is extremely effective in ripping apart the e6/f7 complex.


**11...e5**

Black avoids doom and gloom on e6, but in turn opens the gates to f7. It is rarely a good idea for the defender to play ...e6-e5 (or ...e7- e5) with his king more than a move away from castling, as White will have time to mount a dangerous offensive against the f7-pawn. In this case the attack features Ng5 and Bf7, but in other premature ...e5 positions, the gambiteer can jet his queen to b3, with themes echoing the classical e4/e5 gambits.

**12.Nf3 Be7**

Black tries to castle but it is too late.

**13.Bxf7! Kxf7 14.Ng5+-**

Showcased in Esserman - Nakamura, Chicago 2000. 14...Ke8 15.Ne6 and the knight grazes freely on e6 while the black king withers in the center once more.

In the Morra Gambit, due to White's extreme lead in development, sound sacrifices can instantly appear from just about anywhere on the board. So keep an open mind to any possibility and be alert.

**Be Alert - 9.Nb5!**

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 Nc6 5.Nf3 d6 6.Bc4 Nf6**

Black has developed normally and without reproach, following well established opening principles. He has obeyed the classic rule: "knights before bishops," while not wasting any time. And the necessary ...d6 inhibited White's e4-e5 thrust. Who would then think that White can seize the advantage with a forcing tactical sequence?

**7.e5!**

The gambiteer charges ahead regardless, ignoring Black's d6-barricade. But his advance is far from reckless, for if 7... lLlxe5, then 8.ltJxe5 dxe5 9.j,xf7t! nets the queen.

**7...dxe5 8.Qxd8 Nxd8**

If 8...Kxd8, then 9.Ng5 hits Black from other side!

**9.Nb5!**

Despite making three logical opening moves, Black falls into grave danger, and if he is not inspired enough to find 9...Rb8 (which still leads to his ruin), he may get shamefully mated in only 11 moves.

**9...Kd7?? 10.Nxe5! Ke8 11.Nc7#**

I'm sure I'm not the only Morra player to spring this embarrassing trap several times on unsuspecting opponents. Black must therefore

carefully tread 6...a6! to prevent the nasty e4- e5! and Bb5 incursion, when we would enter the theoretically touted Taylor Defense, or what some Morra skeptics like to call "Old Faithful". I shall call it "Taylor's Temple of Doom". Black aims to simply play ...Bg4 and follow up with mass exchanges after ...Bxf3, ...Ne5 and ...Nxc4. However, as we shall see, Taylor's Temple is far from the celebrated refutation the Morra bashers like to promote.

alas we have a Scheveningen structure where Black's light-squared bishop did not report for duty...

**12...e6**

**Be Alert** - **11.Nxb5!**

**13.Bxe6! fxe6 14.Qxe6 Be7 15.Nxd6+-** Pure carnage. White’s pieces swarm, and his rooks lie in reserve. The rout is on!

## The "Fear Factor"

We have reached a critical position of the Taylor Defense, where Black has just threatened White's bishop with 10...b5. A lazy gambiteer may quickly retreat the bishop. The alert master, on the other hand, will notice that Black's light bishop is missing in action...

**11.Nxb5!**

A decisive bolt from the blue. Black's king remains many tempi away from castling, and now will be pounded on the suddenly soft a4- e8 diagonal. He cannot capture the knight due to the decisive pin .ixb5, and ifhe refuses to go down quietly then...

**11...Rb8 12.Ng5!**

...the tag team of knight, bishop and queen lay waste to the f7-square. If now 12...e6, then

Throughout the book I will be recommending sharp, yet objectively sound continuations and sacrifices. But tournament chess is not played in a science laboratory, and sometimes things go awry in the heat of battle. In these cases, even when you know you are in trouble, do not despair, for you will have the gambit fear foetor on your side. Once you brave the Morra Gambit, you up the psychological tension, putting your opponent on the razor's edge. Now he knows that you are not afraid to sacrifice a pawn, so who knows what you will do next? You become a loose cannon, a wildcard, a jackal, a joker. This is what your opponent will likely think of you, regardless of what you think of yourself in the moment. Your opponent probably will scoff at your opening choice, but he is probably also afraid. Just remember the words of the great Mikhail Tal if ever you feel you are headed off an

unsound cliff: "some sacrifices are sound, the rest are mine!"

To conclude, I will show one of my "unsound" Morra Gambit games which would have amused the Latvian genius.

**8.Qe2?!**

8\.0-0! Ten years ago I lacked the experience and skill to appreciate the streaming chaos after 8...b4 9.Nd5!, and instead choose to cowardly defend my e-pawn. But I promise this will be the last soft move you see from me from here

on out.

**8...Nc6 9.0-0 Nge7 10.Bg5!**

Chasing the queen!

**10...f6**

Forcing the desired kingside concession. Now I sank into deep thought for nearly an hour. During my meditation I envisioned that after 11.Be3, Black would respond with the unpleasant 11...Na5!, and I would have to 

beat a full retreat (normally not a good sign in gambits). So, knowing full well that my next move bordered on the unsound and even the absurd, I did it anyway. Mter all, you only live once, so why not enjoy giving up your pieces?

**11.Rfd1!?(?!) Qb8?**

My seasoned opponent spent about 3 minutes to produce this blunder. Perhaps Kreiman feared 11.Rfd1 could have been prepared?! Or even if he suspected that it just hangs a piece, why risk coming under barbaric attack when he can just calmly subdue his weaker opponent?

11\...fxg5! No fear. 12.Nxg5!? (12.Bxe6?!-+ should not net enough material for the queen.) 12...Qc7 13.Rxd7!? The insane intention behind ll.Rfdl, sound or not! 13...Qxd7 14.Bxe6

A terrifying position for a grandmaster to defend versus a master, even if he's up a rook and a bishop! The king and queen now come under heavy fire. 14...Qd6 15.Bf7 Kd8 16.Rd1 Nd4 17.Rxd4!+- The scintillating variation which convinced me to go for the outlandish piece sacrifice. Sure, Black can hold with the unnatural sequence 15...Kd7 16.Rd1 Nd4 17.Qg4 Kc6!-+, or even 12...Kb6/12...Ka5+ as the queen flees from the nasty forks. However, Grandmaster Kreiman took one look at the possible danger on the field and ran for the hills. I promise you very similar experiences when unleashing Morra mayhem. Your opponents will shake in the face of such savage attacks, unless of course they are made of steel.

**12.Bh4**

Kreiman's desire to play it safe soon backfires. He had no choice but to accept the sacrifice, for as a result of his misplaced queen, I now have a raging initiative. Soon he encounters horrors far more terrifYing than had he just grabbed on g5. And that's the point! There is no escaping chaos in the Morra Gambit.

**12...Ng6 13.Bg3**

Chase, chase, chase the queen!

**13...Nce5 14.Nxe5 fxe5**

14\...Nxe5 15.f4!± and after the knight vacates, the shattering f4-f5 leaves the f7/e6 complex in ruin while the bishop again stalks the queen.

**15.Kg4!±**



Suddenly White threatens the pulverizing Rxd7 followed by Qxe6 and a knockout on the c-file. The Morra "fear factor" reigns supreme.

**15...Bc8**

A sad necessity. The storm clouds are gathering. If 15...Qc7 16.Rac1! further harassing the queen.



**16.h4!**

Pinning the bishop to its original f8-square, else h5 and Wxg7 crunches.

**16...Nf4 17.Bxf4**

Happily removing Black's only active piece.

**17...exf4**

Kreiman intends to use the e5-square as a safe haven for his queen and the base of future operations, when he could then finally free his king's bishop and hope to castle. He must not succeed.



**18.e5!**

Emboldened, I blow up the queen's hideout and clear the path to the king. And who cares about another pawn when you have already offered to sacrifice a whole piece?

**18...Qxe5 19.Re1!**

Yet another queen chase allows the rooks to harmoniously regroup along the central files, where they will pummel Black's king at last.

**19...Qb8 20.Rad1!**




A perfect time for a photograph. All of White's pieces are ready to strike. All of Black's lie on their original squares, except for the queen of course, which is still near her home. A Morra gambiteer dreams of such moments.

The great Romantics of old smile from above, and the rest needs no comment. Or does it?

**20...Ra7 21.Nd5!**

The monstrous knight, often sacrificed on the d5 "ring offire", now roams freely, immune from capture!

**21...g6 22.Nf6 Kf7 23.Nxd7! Bxd7**

**24.Rxd7 Rhd7 25.Qxe6 Kg7 26.Qxd7 Kh6 27.Qg4 Bd6 28.Qg5 Kg7 29.h5! Rf8**

I've played flawlessly after dubiously sacrificing on move 11. But now, in massive time pressure, the fear factor suddenly betrays me, and bad nerves spoil the show. As my time ticked under 30 seconds, I uncorked 30.h6t??, and even though I'm still winning without difficulty, I found a way to flag on move 40.

**...0-1**


If only the spectacle had reached its rightful conclusion...

**30.Re7! Bxe7 31.h6!**

Only now does the pawn advance, forcing mate.

**31...Kh8 32.Kxe7!+-**

Without a doubt the most painful loss of my career. Years later it still stings. But this chess

tragedy motivated me to work much harder, and who knows, if it had never happened, you might not be reading this book today.

## A word on the Morra Declined

Although Black can steer the struggle into positions considered far drier than the Morra Accepted by simply declining the "free" pawn on move three, I will make sure to recommend variations that are sound, but consistent with the Morra mayhem style whenever possible. This way, there will be truly nowhere for the Sicilian schemer to hide. I offer a few teasers:

## Morra Declined - 3...Qa5

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 Qa5**


In this rare Declined line, Black's queen aspires to cramp White's style. However, after the virtually untested 4.i.d2!, the gambiteer laughs his way to a Morra accepted, but with a bishop on d2 and queen on a5, and we know who that favors!

## Morra Declined - 3...Nf6

**1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 Nf6 4.e5 Nd5**

And we arrive at the Alapin variation of the Sicilian by transposition. The declining schemer will seek stodgy, sterile positions, whereas we shall strive for chaos

**5.Nf3 Nc6 6.Bc4! Nb6 7.Bb3**

And the gambiteer unveils the Alapin's version of the Morra Gambit. The schemer still desperately clings to the role of the spoiler.

**7...d5 8.exd6 Qxd6 9.0-0 Be6 10.Na3!?**

Run as he may, Black has no choice but to face his worst fears. He will be attacked, but will he be ready?

Of course, even if a position ever becomes "dry", you must be prepared to grind away. Most positions that amateurs may consider "boring" are actually full of life. You'd be surprised by the dangers lurking in even the simplest positions.
