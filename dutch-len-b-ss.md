## Introduction

Welcome to my course on the Leningrad System against all the main opening lines except for 1.e4 and 1.g4! The course has three different levels:

1. This Short & Sweet level where I give an overview of the different types of positions and the main strategic ideas.

2. The full script with all the chapters: Here I go in great detail on all the lines. I have incorporated many improvements on games between top grandmasters and I will continue to do so over time based on feedback from you and new insights from even stronger engines.

3. The video course: I strongly recommend this if you want to improve your overall chess level. I have used the video course as a tool for coaching, explaining the different positional and strategic factors.

I have gained myself 150 rating points since I picked up the Leningrad and many of my wins were with White where I was able to use ideas and concepts that I had learned as part of studying the Leningrad. The reason is that in the Leningrad System, strategic concepts are key, the opening is more about understanding the position than about deep calculation.

I should not forget to mention an important aspect of my course: playing chess should be fun! I am an amateur myself, I know I will never be able to play chess at the 2700 level, so it is important for me that the time I spend on it is time I enjoy. So wherever possible, I try to avoid move repetitions, sterile positions, and drawn endgames. For a professional grandmaster, it is perfectly fine to play like that, but when I am sitting down for an over the board game on a Saturday afternoon, I want to have a position that inspires me, that is a real fight and where I can apply my understanding of the game.

## Leningrad Variation 7...c6 − 8.Qb3

**1.d4 f5**

This course is based on 1...f5. Depending on your lines against 1.e4, you could also follow most of our repertoire with 1...d6 and 2...f5. It means that against 1.e4 it is OK to play for example the Modern Defense or the Pirc or certain variations of the Philidor.<addx start="2...f5"/>

**2.Nf3 Nf6**

I prefer to first develop the knight and take control over the e4-square and play ...d7-d6 later.

**3.g3 g6**

This repertoire starts with the moves 1...f5 and 2...Nf6. In most of the lines, you will see that on move three we play 3...g6 followed by a later ...d7-d6. Considering that in 95% of the repertoire we don’t play ...d7-d5, Black could also first play 3...d6 on move three and on move 4...g6. This will result in a transposition.<addx start="2...Nf6"/><addx start="3...g6"/><addx start="3...d6"/><addx start="4...g6"/>

**4.Bg2 Bg7**

Black continues with the typical Leningrad setup, first the bishop to g7, next is castling kingside.

**5.O-O O-O 6.c4**

This is the way to one of the main positions of the Leningrad System.

**6...d6**

Black has developed the kingside and now starts focusing on one of the most typical plans in the Leningrad System: preparing ...e7-e5.

**7.Nc3**

This is an important position to remember because there are many different move orders for White to reach this position, but in all cases, Black has put the bishop on g7, castled kingside, and the pawn is on d6. White has the knights on f3 and c3, pawns on d4 and c4, and has castled kingside.

**7...c6**

The main line of the Leningrad System where my preference is to play with 7...c6. I have also made a brief overview of why I think the main alternatives 7...Qe8 and 7...Nc6 are inferior.

The idea of playing ...c7-c6 is to take away the d5-square from White while, at the same time, it is also a useful waiting move. In many lines of the Leningrad System, Black needs to play ...c7-c6 eventually, but by playing it this early we can still adapt our plans based on the setup White chooses.

**8.Qb3**

This move became popular based on a great game by Korchnoi.

**8...Na6**

Initially, I wanted to recommend 8...Kh8, but Black struggles in that line to equalize and it is discussed further in the course.

**9.Re1**

Preparing e2-e4.

**9...Qb6**

The queen from b3 has to go and Black is not afraid of playing a position without queens.

**10.Qc2 Qc7**

From here the queen helps to prepare ...e7-e5.

**11.c5**

A pawn sacrifice, claiming that the pawn on e7 will become structurally weak.

**11...dxc5 12.Bf4 Qd8 13.e3 Be6**

Black doesn't take 13...cxd4 because after 14.exd4 White would have great pressure along the e-file. In the current position, all of Black's pieces are active and we have no problems. Next, we may play ...h7-h6 or ...Nh5, to attack the bishop on f4, but also exchanging pieces with ...Nd5 comes into consideration.

## Leningrad Variation 7...c6 − 8.d5 #1

**1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6 7.Nc3 c6**

**8.d5**

This is the old main line. White grabs some space, forcing Black to play ...e7-e5 soon because otherwise, the position would be too cramped. However, after ...e7-e5 White will take on e6 and try to prove that the pawn on d6 is weak.

**8...e5**

This is the standard reaction we will see in many lines. Black gets a weak pawn on d6 but creates counterplay against White's pawn on c4.

8...Bd7 is too slow. If Black doesn't want to play ...e7-e5, the attention can be switched to the queenside, for example with taking on d5 followed by ...b7-b5, but here this is taking a lot of time and White will create serious pressure with moves such as Re1 and e2-e4. 9.Re1 Na6 10.e4.

White's plan to push e2-e4 is something we always need to be aware of as a Black player. 10...Nxe4 we don't want to allow e4-e5, so taking is the only option. 11.Nxe4 fxe4 12.Rxe4 Nc5 13.Re1 with a clear advantage for White. The e7-pawn is weak and can be attacked by Bg5 while the knight can go to e6 via d4 and there is very little Black can do.

**9.e4**

Not the main line, but quite a normal move that should not be underestimated. The position looks a lot like a g3-King's Indian.

**9...cxd5**

The idea of this move is that Black weakens White's center and creates the option of playing along the c-file.

**10.cxd5 Na6**

Developing the knight via d7 doesn't come into consideration because you want the bishop on c8, to keep an eye on the e6-square and the pawn on f5.

**11.exf5 gxf5 12.Nh4**

It looks so normal for White to focus on the light squares and attack the f5-pawn, but in this setup, it doesn't work.

**12...f4**

The engine believes White should play here 13.h3 to stop ...Bg4, but it is not an easy move to play. Black can take 13...fxg3 and if White takes back 14.fxg3, the dark squares from b6 to g1 are weak.

**13.a3 Bg4 14.Qc2**

The white queen doesn't feel safe anywhere. It could drop back to b1, but that would limit the rook on a1 from getting active.

**14...Rc8**

The white queen doesn't feel safe anywhere.

**15.Bd2 b5**

Always nice if we can play these types of active moves. Black has already a strong initiative and in a practical game without engines, White will struggle to survive. Black can next play ...Qb6, ...Nc5 followed by ...a7-a5 to increase the pressure even further.

## Leningrad Variation 7...c6 − 8.d5 #2

**1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6 7.Nc3 c6 8.d5 e5**

**9.dxe6**

This is the main continuation. Both sides have a weak pawn, Black on d6, White on c4. If both sides can protect their pawns, Black will aim for ...d6-d5 in such a way that we can take back with pieces on d5 without ending up with an isolated pawn, which in this position would not be an asset.

**9...Bxe6 10.Qb3**

A sharp move considering the bishop on e6. White is hoping for Ng5 and when the bishop moves, c4-c5+, but Black moves first!

**10...b5**

Making use of the pin and threatening to take a pawn. Black is also taking a risk since the bishop on g2 is eyeing the pawn on c6 and the rook on a8.

**11.Nd4**

Attacking the bishop and the pawn on c6.

**11...Bxc4 12.Qc2**

White threatens to take on c6 and to take on b5 because the c6-pawn is pinned.

**12...b4**

Only move.

**13.Na4 Bf7 14.Bg5**

White is in no hurry to win back the pawn, claiming that with Black's knight on b8 there is sufficient compensation. In the relevant chapter, I analyze that taking on c6 will not bring White anything because the knight on a4 is offside.

**14...Qc7**

Defending the c6-pawn.

**15.Rfd1 Ne4**

A small tactical trick.

**16.Bf4**

White cannot win back the pawn on e4 straightaway because after taking twice 16.Bxe4 fxe4 17.Qxe4, Black wins a piece with 17...Qa5, attacking the knight on a4 and the bishop on g5.

**16...Qe7**

Defending the knight on e4.

**17.Rac1 Rc8**

We have a very complex position which, according to the engine, is balanced. Black dreams of moving the pawns to d5 and c5 and if that proves successful we might very well be better.

## Leningrad Variation 7...c6 − 8.d5 #3

**1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6 7.Nc3 c6 8.d5 e5 9.dxe6 Bxe6**

**10.Qd3**

One of the main ways of defending the pawn on c4, hoping to put a rook on d1 and a bishop on f4 to win the d6-pawn.

**10...Na6**

Black continues with normal development.

**11.Bf4**

This direct attack on the d6-pawn is not dangerous because the white pawn on c4 is weak as well. Still, this move is played a lot in blitz games.

**11...Re8 12.Bxd6 Ne4**

A great move to play, White can just avoid losing a piece.

**13.Be5**

White loses after 13.Nxe4 due to 13...fxe4 and now 14.Qxe4 drops the bishop on d6 and if the queen moves, Black takes the knight on f3.

**13...Nac5 14.Qe3**

White can also exchange queens on d8, but in the corresponding chapter, you will find the analysis on how Black can easily solve all the problems.

**14...Bxc4**

Taking the pawn back.

**15.Bxg7 Kxg7**

And Black is fine − we have active pieces and no pawn weaknesses. Our pieces are more active, especially since the white queen is placed awkwardly. If White is not careful, we will reach an endgame where Black either wins the pawn on e2 or lands a rook on d2.

## Leningrad Variation 7...c6 − 8.Re1

**1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6 7.Nc3 c6**

**8.Re1**

A sharp move, with the idea to play e2-e4 as soon as possible.

**8...Ne4**

I believe this is the only sound option for Black.

**9.Nxe4**

Not the most critical approach, but so logical that it is likely to appear on the board often.

**9...fxe4 10.Ng5 d5**

The only way to defend the pawn on e4, which was attacked twice.

**11.Be3 h6**

The idea of chasing the knight to h3 is that after White has played f2-f3, taking back with the bishop on f3 (which would increase the pressure on d5) will no longer be possible as the knight on h3 would be hanging.

**12.Nh3 Bf5**

Simply developing the pieces.

**13.f3 exf3 14.exf3 dxc4**

Black is a pawn up, which can be defended if necessary by ...b7-b5. White cannot immediately get the pawn back because the pawn on d4 is weak and the knight on h3 is still offside. White will need to play precisely to maintain the balance.

## Leningrad Variation 7...c6 − 8.Bg5

**1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6 7.Nc3 c6**

**8.Bg5 Ne4!**

Immediately countering White's idea of taking on f6 and pushing e2-e4.

**9.Nxe4 fxe4 10.Nd2 Bxd4**

I also analyzed 10...d5 but it appears White will come out on top after the complications. 11.Qb3, whenever Black plays a setup with a pawn on e4 and another one on d5, White will try to undermine these pawns and take control of the light squares by putting pressure on d5 and playing f2-f3.

11...h6 12.Be3 Kh7. Stepping away from the queen on b3 and protecting the pawn on h6 so, if given the chance, Black can take on d4 with the bishop. 13.cxd5 cxd5 14.f3 exf3 15.Nxf3 Nc6. Black is one to two tempi short of equalizing while White is ahead in development and can start concrete actions.

16.Ne5 Rxf1+ 17.Rxf1 Nxe5 18.dxe5 Be6. Taking on e5 with the bishop will result in a lost endgame for Black after Rf7+ followed by Qxd5. 19.Qxb7 and I don't see how Black can equalize. White is a pawn up and the pawns on e7, d5 and a7 are weak.

**11.Qc2 e3**

Giving White a useless extra pawn on e3.

Trying to defend the pawn with 11...d5 would end up in a bad position for Black after 12.Rad1 followed by cxd5. There is a pin on the d-file to the queen on d8 and White threatens to play Nxe4, because after ...dxe4 there is always Qc4+, picking up the bishop on d4.

**12.fxe3 Bg7 13.Rxf8+ Qxf8**

We want to take back with the queen and not with the bishop or king because Black would lose a tempo to return them to g7/g8. After ...Qxf8 it may seem as we also lose a tempo after Rf1, but the difference is that White is playing Rf1 while after taking with king or bishop on f8, White can make many other useful moves as Rf1 is not forced.

In general, Black is fine in this position. White has one tricky attempt with Qe4, which is analyzed further in the main course. Black's plan is to quickly develop the pieces on the queenside, even if this comes at the cost of a pawn because White has weak double e-pawns and the pawn on b2 often drops.

## Leningrad Variation 7...c6 − 8.Rb1

**1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.O-O O-O 6.c4 d6 7.Nc3 c6**

**8.Rb1**

A logical move − White has focused on healthy development and now wants to expand on the queenside with b2-b4-b5, attacking the c6-pawn. For this plan, it is useful that the rook is no longer in the vision of the g7-bishop.

**8...a5**

Making it more difficult for White to expand on the queenside, who will now need the move a2-a3 and after a later b2-b4, Black can take and open the a-file for the a8-rook.

**9.d5**

An interesting setup that has been used by White players a few times in practice. The idea is to prevent Black from playing ...e7-e5 and trying to prove that Rb1 is more useful than ...a7-a5.

**9...e5 10.dxe6 Bxe6**

Black has gotten rid of the backward pawn on e7 and now attacks the pawn on c4.

**11.b3 Qe7**

Black is fine and ready to finish development with ...Na6 (if you play ...Nbd7, White may decide to obtain the pair of bishops with Ng5 and there is no reason for Black to allow it, even though it would not be a disaster). After ...Na6, Black can continue with ...Nc5 and put a knight on e4 or place a rook on d8 and play ...d6-d5.

## Dutch 2.g3 − b4 Systems

**1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.g3 g6**

In this overview I will discuss the lines where at some point White plays b2-b4. The big difference is whether there is already a white pawn on c4 or not yet. In general, I recommend a Stonewall setup.

I have also given as an illustration the line where Black plays a setup with ...d7-d6 and ...e7-e5, but often my analysis ended in a position that is not fully satisfactory for Black. But in a practical game, you may still want to play that as the chances White will play all the perfect moves are slim.

**4.b4**

The idea of this move is to play a b4 system with the bishop still on f1. Not often seen in practice, but you need to realize that if you play with ...Nc6 with Black, White may push b4-b5 and if you move then your knight to a5, White can still decide to play e2-e3 and cover the c4-square with the bishop.

This variation is also likely to transpose to one of the other b4-systems White can play. Again, the exact move order is not so important, it is about the characteristics: in this case, the fact that White's bishop is still on f1.

**4...Bg7 5.Bb2 d5**

White still had the possibility to play c2-c4, so Black’s plans with ...d7-d6 followed by ...e7-e5 may result in slightly worse positions. In general, I recommend the ...d7-d5 push in all the b4-lines. The systems where White plays with the pawn on c4 are discussed in great detail in the main course.

**6.Bg2 a5**

Black can also castle kingside, but I like to immediately attack the pawn on b4 before White gets the chance to consolidate. The pawn on b4 is a bit loose. If White defends with a2-a3, Black can take on b4, exchange rooks and attack the b-pawn again with ...Nc6. If White needs to play c2-c3 to defend this pawn, the dark-squared bishop will become very passive.

**7.b5**

If White defends the pawn on b4 with 7.a3, Black can exchange 7...axb4 8.axb4 Rxa1 9.Bxa1 and continue with 9...Qd6. White will need to defend the b4-pawn again and next Black can play ...Ne4 followed by ...e7-e5. In no time, Black has freed the position.

**7...c6**

Black is immediately opening the c-file before White can stabilize. Note that a2-a4 will not help White here, because Black can take on b5 and attack the pawn again with either ...Bd7 and/or ...Qb6.

**8.bxc6 Nxc6**

This was Black’s idea by playing 6...a5, we won a tempo to develop the knight on b8.

**9.O-O O-O**

Black has completed development on the kingside.

**10.a4 Ne4**

White has weaknesses on the c4 and c3-squares and Black would like to make use of that by first preventing White's c2-c4 and then by creating pressure on the queenside. The idea of ...Ne4 is that it prepares ...Be6 (controlling the square c4) because there is no Ng5 from White anymore and the black knight on e4 could later either go to c3 (if supported by a rook on c8) or come back to d6 to have more control over the c4-square.

**11.Nbd2 Be6**

Taking control over the c4-square. If White takes the knight on e4 now in order to follow up with Ng5, Black can withdraw the bishop. We are likely to win the pawn on d4 and have a strong center with the advanced pawn on e4.

**12.e3 Rc8**

The engine says it is still equal, but Black’s position is easier to play I think. We are ready to play moves like ...Nb4 and ...Qb6 and White doesn’t have any active plans.

## Dutch 2.g3 − 5.Qb3

**1.d4 f5 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 g6 4.c3**

White’s idea is to place the queen on b3 to apply pressure on the light squares in Black’s camp. If Black counters this with ...d7-d5 or ...e7-e6, White sometimes puts a knight on f4 to prepare d4-d5, c3-c4 (with a black pawn on d5) or h2-h4-h5 to weaken Black’s kingside.

**4...Bg7 5.Qb3**

Preventing Black from castling kingside and attacking the pawn on b7.

**5...Nc6**

Developing the knight but also defending the pawn on b7.

**6.Nh3**

The critical continuation in the line with c3 and Qb3.

**6...e5**

An interesting pawn sacrifice − Black believes the pawn will be regained quickly. 6...d6 is the more solid option and it is analyzed in the main course as well.

**7.Bxc6**

If 7.dxe5, Black can simply take back with the knight 7...Nxe5. White can then not take 8.Bxb7 because Black will play 8...Rb8 winning a piece.

**7...bxc6 8.dxe5 Ne4**

The best square to attack e5.

**9.f3**

If White defends the pawn on e5 with 9.f4, Black will make the pawn sacrifice permanent with 9...d6, which will yield the advantage because of the poor knight on h3 and the weak dark squares on the g1-a7 diagonal.

**9...Nc5**

The only square for the knight, but a good one, attacking the queen.

**10.Qc4 d6**

Offering to make the pawn sacrifice permanent.

**11.Bg5 Qd7 12.Bf6**

A creative way of defending the e5-pawn. Taking the pawn with 12.exd6 is not wise: 12...cxd6 13.Nd2 Ba6 and Black has a strong initiative.

**12...Bxf6 13.exf6 Ba6**

The bishop has a great outpost here, ready to take on e2 when White is not looking.

**14.Qd4 O-O**

I prefer Black. We are likely to regain the pawn on f6, the pawn on e2 is weak and the knight on h3 is not great either.

## Staunton Gambit 2.e4

**1.d4 f5**

**2.e4**

The Staunton Gambit − the main line with 4.Bg5 was first played by Staunton against Horwitz in London 1846. I used to think this move would lead to an advantage for Black, but I had to change my mind. It is a dangerous option and if both sides know what they are doing, chances are probably balanced.<skip/>

**2...fxe4 3.f3**

White is offering a permanent pawn sacrifice, one that in the Leningrad System Black almost never accepts. The standard defense is to protect the pawn on e4.

**3...d5 4.fxe4 dxe4 5.Nc3 Nf6**

There is not a big difference between first developing the knight or protecting the pawn with 5...Bf5.

**6.Bc4 Nc6**

This is an important move. Even more important than the idea to attack the pawn on d4 is to start chasing the white bishop because Black's light squares are a bit weak.

**7.Nge2 Na5**

Step 1.

**8.Bb5+ c6**

Step 2.

**9.Ba4 b5**

And step 3, the bishop will not survive.

**10.Bb3 Bf5**

There is no rush to take on b3, but taking immediately is also fine.

**11.Ng3 e6 12.Bg5**

A typical pin to win back the pawn on e4. Usually, White does need to give up the bishop for the knight on f6 and in the resulting positions, Black's bishop pair can be strong.

**12...Nxb3 13.axb3 Be7**

White was threatening to take on e4 because of the pinned knight on f6.

**14.Bxf6 Bxf6 15.Ncxe4 Bxd4**

The king is in trouble and White needs to quickly escape to an endgame.

## Anti-Dutch 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Bg5

**1.d4 f5**

**2.Nc3**

White wants to play e2-e4.

**2...Nf6 3.Bg5**

White wants to take on f6 to create doubled pawns. White could then either try to benefit from the weak pawn on f5 or play for c2-c4, claiming that if Black takes on c4, a white bishop on c4 will be very powerful now that there are no longer pawns on either f7, e6, or d5 to stop this bishop.

**3...d5 4.e3**

A strange move, White has first played for e2-e4, when Black prevented that White played for disrupting Black’s pawn structure and now forgets about all that and just starts developing pieces. Of course, White is not worse by taking this approach, there is nothing wrong with developing, but this plan misses a bit of focus so it is not threatening for Black.

**4...e6 5.g4**

A sharp move that also shows up in some other Leningrad System lines.

**5...fxg4 6.h3 g3**

This is a very typical reaction for Black in the Leningrad System if faced with g2-g4: we take on g4 and then give the pawn back on g3 so that the light squares won't become too weak.

**7.fxg3 c5**

A standard reaction in all these lines is to undermine White's d-pawn with ...c7-c5.

**8.Qd2 Be7**

Black is happy to lose a tempo with the bishop and take back on c5 because the e3-pawn would be seriously weakened.

**9.Nge2 O-O 10.Nf4 Nc6 11.O-O-O**

Now that White has castled queenside it is time for Black to launch the attack.

**11...Rb8 12.Bg2**

If White keeps the bishop on f1, Black may play ...c5-c4 and then follow up with ...b7-b5-b4 and ...Qa5.

**12...b5**

I think Black's attack plays much easier, the pawns are advancing much quicker than White's and also the black queen can easily join from a5.

## Colle Setup − 2.c4 Nf6 3.Nc3 d6 4.e3

**1.d4 f5**

**2.c4**

Sometimes White wants to go for a setup with Nc3, Qc2, Bd3, and Nge2. Against the Leningrad System, this is usually not so threatening.

The move 2.e3 is also an option but transposes to lines where e2-e3 is played at a later stage and where the knight from g1 either moves to f3 or to e2 (after Bd3).

**2...Nf6 3.Nc3 d6**

First ...g7-g6 is also fine, but I like the idea that I have ...e7-5 ready in case White wants to do something creative like f2-f3 followed by e2-e4.

**4.e3 g6**

Preparing the Leningrad setup.

**5.Bd3 Bg7 6.Nge2**

White is not making it difficult for Black to play ...e7-e5.

**6...e5**

Black could also first have castled kingside.

**7.O-O O-O 8.b4**

White has to create some play on the queenside, otherwise, Black will just advance and mate the white king.

**8...Be6**

You might be tempted to play ...e5-e4, but this is not so great if we haven't prepared with ...c7-c6 and ...d6-d5. After ...e5-e4 White can quickly start attacking the center with f2-f3.

**9.d5 Bf7**

In the Leningrad, the bishop often feels at home on f7. Here Black keeps the option open to attack the white center with ...c7-c6.

**10.e4 f4**

This looks like an improved King's Indian structure for Black. The advance ...g6-g5-g4 is hard to stop and Black's kingside attack will be much faster than White's queenside play.

## Colle Setup − 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.e3

**1.d4 f5**

**2.Nf3**

In this overview we will discuss systems that are linked to the London and Colle setups. In many of these lines, Black prepares the pawn push to e5 and then continues with ...g6-g5-g4, creating a dangerous kingside attack. One of the advantages of playing the Leningrad System is that there is no easy life for White in these setups compared to the Slav and all the Indian Defenses. This chapter also includes all the lines that can arise when White starts with d2-d4, c2-c4, and Nc3.

**2...Nf6**

I prefer to first develop the knight and take control over the e4-square and play ...d7-d6 later.

**3.e3**

A modest setup from White that resembles a Colle setup.

**3...g6 4.c4**

A rather rare continuation. White can also put this pawn on c3 but it will only mean a loss of tempo: Black will stick to the plan of playing for ...e7-e5 followed by a kingside attack, while White's play on the queenside will not be very fast with the pawn on c3.

**4...Bg7 5.Nc3 O-O 6.Bd3**

The bishop is not great on d3. Maybe White should put this bishop on e2, but in all cases, Black is likely to play for ...e7-e5.

**6...d6 7.O-O Nc6**

The kingside is developed, so Black continues on the queenside.

**8.b3 e5**

Black threatens to win a piece with ...e5-e4 and if White decides to play 9.d5, Black can play 9...Ne7 and end up in a King's Indian type of structure where we are a few tempi ahead. We can quickly develop an initiative on the kingside with ...f5-f4 and ...g6-g5-g4.

## London Setup − 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Bf4

**1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 Nf6**

**3.Bf4**

White plays a setup that is known from the London System. Most White players who play this system struggle against the Leningrad because their standard setup doesn't really work.

**3...d6 4.e3 g6 5.Bc4**

White is preventing Black from castling kingside and hopes to land a piece on e6.

**5...e6**

Black cannot do without this move if we want to castle kingside.

**6.O-O Bg7 7.Nbd2 O-O**

Black has completed the Leningrad setup and will now develop the queenside.

**8.h3 Nc6 9.c3**

White is playing it solidly, but this is precisely when it becomes easy to play the Leningrad: prepare to play the e7-pawn (via e6 in this case) to e5.

**9...Kh8**

Now the e6-pawn is no longer pinned by the bishop on c4.

**10.Bh2 Qe7**

Getting ready for ...e6-e5.

**11.b4 b6**

Note that Black would lose a pawn if we were to play ...e6-e5 because White has b4-b5.

**12.a4 a5**

Black has stopped White's expansion on the queenside. Next, we will first place the bishop on b7 and then reroute the knight from c6 to f7 via d8 and play either ...e6-e5 or maybe even better ...g6-g5, to launch a kingside attack.

## Manhattan Variation 2.Qd3 #1

**1.d4 f5**

**2.Qd3**

Maybe not fashionable but it does have some venom. White wants to prove that Black has weakened the light squares by playing 1...f5 and the idea is that by first playing Qd3, White keeps the option open to continue with either e2-e4, g2-g4, or even first h2-h3 and then g2-g4.

**2...d5**

Black maintains control over the e4-square and goes for a Stonewall type of setup. Note that if White now plays 3.g4, we transpose to the line with 2.g4 followed by 3.Qd3, which is discussed further in the course.<skip start="2.g4"/><skip start="3.Qd3"/>

Black's other less desirable options on move 2, 2...e6, 2...g6 and 2...Nc6 are also covered.

**3.Bf4 Nf6**

The immediate 3...c5 is also possible. 4.dxc5 Nf6 5.Nf3 e6 6.e3 Bxc5. The pawn is back but Black is not out of trouble yet. 7.c4 Nc6 8.Nc3, White keeps increasing the pressure on Black's center. 8...O-O 9.Be2 Ne4 10.O-O g5. Black has to become active on the kingside considering the c8-bishop doesn't have a future yet. 11.Bg3 g4 12.Ne1 Nxg3 13.hxg3 d4 14.Na4 Be7 and Black may follow up with ...e6-e5 and ...Be6, completing development.

**4.c4**

4.e3, White can also play a setup with e2-e3 and c2-c3, with a stable center, but that is quite passive. 4...e6 5.Nf3 c5 6.c3 Nc6. Black has nothing to worry about, we can complete development and castle kingside.

**4...e6 5.e3**

White cannot lock Black in yet with 5.c5 because the counter 5...b6 is strong and if 6.b4 Black has 6...a5.

**5...c5**

Black has to generate some counterplay, otherwise, the position is too passive.

**6.Nc3 cxd4**

The disadvantage of this swap is that the pawn on e6 becomes even weaker, but without this exchange on d4, it would be hard for Black to keep the pawn on d5 alive.

**7.exd4 Nc6 8.Nf3**

Black needs to play accurately to maintain the balance.

**8...dxc4**

Hoping for a blockade on d5 with a knight.

**9.Qxc4 Bd6**

Reducing White's influence on the dark squares.

**10.Bxd6 Qxd6 11.g3 O-O 12.Bg2 a6**

With the idea to play ...b7-b5 and put the bishop on b7, to have more control over d5.

**13.O-O Rd8**

Not only attacking the pawn on d4 but also increasing the control over the d5-square.

**14.Rfd1 b5**

Gaining space and making the b7-square accessible for the c8-bishop.

**15.Qc5**

White would love to exchange queens on c5, but Black doesn't need to take.

**15...Rb8**

Removing the rook from the potentially dangerous long diagonal.

**16.Rac1 h6**

Stopping any Ng5 ideas.

**17.Qxd6 Rxd6 18.Ne5 Ne7**

Black is fine. The isolated d-pawn is blocked and there are no easy targets for White to attack.

## Manhattan Variation 2.Qd3 #2

**1.d4 f5 2.Qd3 d5**

**3.c4 e6**

A standard move, protecting the pawn on d5.

**4.Nc3 Nf6 5.Bg5 c6**

Black is setting up the Stonewall.

**6.e3 Be7**

The bishop can also go to d6, but I prefer to get out of the pin and have the option of playing ...Ne4.

**7.Nf3 O-O 8.Qc2**

White's queen is wrongly placed on d3 and in general, this setup is not dangerous against the Stonewall.

**8...Ne4 9.Bxe7 Qxe7 10.Bd3 Bd7**

Sometimes this bishop is activated via ...b7-b6 to either the square b7 or to a6, but Black only considers this option when the white bishop is on g2. The alternative is to play ...Bd7-e8 and sometimes to h5, although e8 is not a bad square either. Depending on future developments, the bishop may have a great future on c6.

**11.Ne5 Be8 12.O-O-O**

An aggressive setup, with the idea of playing f2-f3 and g2-g4 to attack, but it doesn't really work here.

12.O-O Nd7 13.Nxd7 Bxd7 14.f3 Nf6 15.Rae1 h6 Black has no problems. 16.e4? This is one of those cases of overextending in the center. 16...dxe4 17.fxe4 Qd6. Black has a clear advantage. It is likely we will win the d4-pawn and be a healthy pawn up. We may follow up with ...Rad8 putting pressure on the d3-bishop and indirectly on the pawns on e4 and c4.

**12...Nd7 13.Nxd7 Bxd7 14.f3 Nf6 15.cxd5**

15.g4? Black can just take the pawn. 15...fxg4 16.fxg4 dxc4 17.Bxc4 Nxg4. The half-open g-file is not that dangerous because White doesn't have the dark-squared bishop anymore and the knight is far away from the kingside. If Black manages to control White's initiative, we will have a large advantage based on the extra pawn, the f2-square, and the possible ...e6-e5 break.

**15...Nxd5 16.Qd2 Rad8**

Threatening ...c6-c5 and White's center gets under serious pressure.

**17.e4 Nxc3 18.Qxc3 Be8**

Black's position is fine. The pawn on d4 is weak, Black can break with ...c6-c5 or ...e6-e5 and/or exchange on e4 and enter with a rook on f2.

## Krejcik Gambit 2.g4

**1.d4 f5**

**2.g4**

An aggressive pawn sacrifice that cannot be underestimated. Some variations transpose to the 2.h3 lines.

**2...d5**

Taking on g4 is also a sound option and it is discussed in the main course.

**3.Qd3**

Increasing the pressure on f5.

**3...g6**

In the main course, I am offering an alternative for Black, 3...e5, which lands on unexplored territory but, according to my analysis, it is fully playable.

**4.gxf5**

This is an old line where nowadays, thanks to the engines, we know Black will be better if White takes the pawn on b7.

**4...Bxf5 5.Qb5+ Nc6 6.Qxb7**

This pawn capture is just bad but we have to know the right sequence for Black.

**6...Nxd4 7.Na3 Rb8 8.Qxa7 e5**

Black is not playing for a direct refutation but claiming that the lead in development combined with a strong pawn center and more active pieces will gain a large advantage.

**9.c3**

Too slow.

**9...Bxa3 10.cxd4 Bb4+ 11.Kd1**

The king is not happy here.

**11...Nf6**

With White's king on d1, Black wants to develop the pieces as quickly as possible.

**12.a3 Bd6 13.dxe5 Bxe5**

Two bishops, a knight and a rook and White has only developed the queen.

**14.Nf3 Bxb2 15.Bxb2 Rxb2**

With a large advantage for Black − White's king is in danger and can no longer castle. After Black castles kingside, we are ready to launch an attack by adding the knight (to, for example, e4) and the queen (imagine a queen on c6 or c4). In a practical game, I would say White is lost.

## English Setups − 1.g3 with 4.c4 #1

**1.g3 f5**

Many other moves are possible, but we want to stick to typical Leningrad System play, if possible.

**2.Bg2 Nf6 3.d3**

White is preparing e2-e4 and Black normally responds by taking on e4 (to lock in the bishop on g2) and play ...e7-e5 to grab some space in the center.

In the course, I spent significant time on the move order 1.Nf3 followed by 2.d3, a move order Magnus Carlsen used successfully, but where Stockfish indicates Black is more than okay.<skip/>

**3...d6 4.c4**

White decided on a typical setup from the English opening and this position can also arise from the 1.c4 move order.

**4...g6 5.Nc3 Bg7 6.e3**

This is a modest move with the intention to increase the central pressure with d3-d4 at a later stage.

**6...O-O 7.Nge2 c6**

There are different ways of playing this position with Black, but I try to stay close to the plans we know from the main lines of the Leningrad System.

**8.b4 a6**

Stopping White's expansion on the queenside for now.

**9.O-O e5**

There is no reason to wait with this move, grab some space in the center and continue to develop.

**10.a4 Qc7**

Normally 10...Qe7 would be okay as well, but here I don't like the look of 11.Ba3.

**11.Bd2 Be6 12.Rb1 Nbd7**

Black has no problems, all the pieces are developed and the ...d6-d5 break will allow Black to occupy the center. White will need to be careful that Black doesn't advance even further with, for example, ...g6-g5 (taking away the f4-square) and either ...e5-e4 or start a kingside attack with the queen coming to h5 via f7.

## English Setups − 1.g3 with 4.c4 #2

**1.g3 f5 2.Bg2 Nf6 3.d3 d6 4.c4 g6 5.Nc3 Bg7**

**6.e4**

The so-called Botvinnik setup in the English, a system that a lot of White players who play the English will follow.

**6...fxe4**

A standard response − we want to take early so that White is inclined to take the pawn back with the d-pawn and not with a piece, locking in the bishop on g2. If Black waits, White may take on f5, opening the long diagonal for the g2-bishop.

White can take back with a piece on e4, but after

**7.Nxe4 Nxe4**

Taking on e4 because White's bishop feels a bit uncomfortable on e4 (it can be attacked by a later ...d6-d5 after ...c7-c6 or ...e7-e6), while taking back with the pawn on e4 would make the bishop on g2 quite passive.

**8.Bxe4 O-O**

Black has completed the kingside development and brought the king into safety. Now it's time to develop on the queenside.

**9.Ne2 Nc6**

A simple development move. If White plays 10.d4 now, Black can play 10...e5 followed by a knight jump to d4 after White plays d4-d5.

**10.Bg2 Bf5**

This bishop could also have gone to g4, it doesn't make a big difference.

**11.O-O Qd7**

White has lost some tempi with the bishop and Black's position is fine. We will play ...Bh3 and ...Ne5 next, if White is not careful, and make use of the weak squares around White's king.

## Nimzo-Larsen 1.b3 f5 − Dutch-style

**1.b3 f5**

If we can play this on the first move, we will!

**2.Bb2 Nf6**

There is no reason to be afraid of Bxf6 in this position. Black would take back with the e-pawn, play ...d7-d5 next, and develop in the same way as in the 2.Nc3 line: ...Be6, ...Nc6, ...Qd7 and castle queenside.

**3.e3 e6**

3...d6 4.d4 e6 would be transposition to the main line, but why would we give White the additional opportunity to take on f6 on move 4 when Black probably needs to lose a tempo later to play ...d6-d5?

**4.Be2**

White can also first develop the knight to f3, which will result in the same position. The system where White plays with f2-f4 is separately discussed in the 1.b3 chapter.

**4...g6**

Black first fianchettoes and only plays ...b6 once White has no longer Bf3.

**5.Nf3 Bg7**

Black could have played 5...b6 now that the white knight is on f3, but I prefer to keep things simple and first develop the kingside, bring the king to safety and then develop the queenside.

**6.O-O O-O 7.c4 b6**

In most of these lines Black fianchettoes both bishops.

**8.Nc3 Bb7**

Note how more effective this bishop is on b7 than on c8 where it is blocked by the pawns on d7 and e6.

**9.d3**

This may look like a flexible move, but often it will result in a loss of tempo because White will play d3-d4 later. In these types of positions, e3-e4 is almost never a good option for White.

Had White played d2-d4 in one go, Black could have played similarly to the main line: complete development, put a knight on e4, and start a kingside attack with ...g6-g5 and bring the queen over to the kingside.

**9...c5**

Black is grabbing space.

**10.Qd2 Nc6**

Black doesn't want to play 10...d5 because White would take 11.cxd5 followed by d3-d4 in the hope of creating an isolated pawn on d5 that can easily be attacked. A valid alternative is to play 10...d6 followed by ...Nbd7.

**11.Rad1 Qe7**

Black's position is fine. At some point, White will play d3-d4 after which Black can get the knight to e4 followed by rerouting the other knight from c6 to f7 via d8 and then starting the kingside attack.
